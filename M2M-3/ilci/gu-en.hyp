His language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' Kutchi ' .
Although this is ' Boli ' it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where many times earthquake has occurred and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal-Toral is very interesting .
If we come from the same way from which we had come then we will have to take a long holiday of one month and on this side schools will open in Mumbai .
So what to do  Now we will travel in the railways by conveying fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and the big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
Considering the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan tourism industry is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing terror danger in global recession and South Asia tourism business has taken a big step .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less in these days .
The latest statistics announced by the Rajasthan government show that in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 national and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and ten lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday Makers of Rajputa says that global recession and terror incidents have completely affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not develop ourselves a strong basic structure of tourism there .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decrease of 3 . percent in comparison to the last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
According to tourism the recent years have been excellent for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first occasion that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , havelis , fort , forests are all old to serve the tourists .
In the field of tourism the government does the matter of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of sacrifices and accidents have also made the image of this state lure internationally .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years ago but it has remained consolidated only till papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic structure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1987 AD .
This corporation provides the facilities of accommodation , food , transportation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one transport unit and two train Palace on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent rooms of its hotels are not filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big mistake .
The main among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This can not become the attraction of tourists towards the railway .
Despite decreasing the rent these tourists are unable to attract .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar fair .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC this year this number decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth in the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously providing benefits .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this railway .
Due to this mistake situated in the field of tourism in Rajasthan the lines of concern in the tourism sector are natural .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of the person then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Rai has justified it by setting up modern city Amboveli in the Sahyadri mountain range of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dreams they had dreamed they glow happiness in their eyes on seeing them progressing day by day .
His happiness was also seen at the time of the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has been successful in making its place as an excellent city .
Spread on more than 10 thousand acres in this city only on 9 percent land hotels , houses and other facilities have been set up .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city built for crores of husbands and today about 800 families live in this city .
Initially industrialists and Amiros bought their residence here in the form of Holiday Home and now they have made it their first house and from here they come to Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley itself is the Korigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Likawali in the western Siang district are very important .
The ruins of a large temple have been found in the excavation .
On the stone pillars of this temple the idols of lotus and goddesses have been excavated which are mostly in a fragmented state .
Malini Thana is an important place in this very region .
At this place a Dasabhuja idol of Devi Durgi is found .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the month of Tamreshwari Devi is found .
The time of Chetia kings was the belief of this goddess in the north - eastern hills till far .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Here the sacrifices of humans were also offered which later King Gaurinath Singh had closed .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which is situated in the terrain between Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories popular here this place is Vidarbha , where at one time the king used to do Bhishmak kingdom .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The Digaru , Mishmi etc tribes here give guidance to the travellers .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees come here from far off places .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of brick pond near Roeing are still making their story .
The ruins of bathing valleys , falling stairs and getting surrounded by pucca fort around another pond and getting the ruins of wide roads are still singing silence of its ancient grandeur .
We reach Jiro for four hours through jeeps from the upper Assam city North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place charms the hearts of the visitors .
This is the charming place where Apata lives .
It took several days to reach here before the road of jeep was made .
On reaching here the views of high deodar trees , beautiful premrose , vollet , wild curtains , strawberry and rasbari enjoy the visitors .
Apple and cardamom are produced here a lot .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of approximately 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the people of Apata .
With his tireless hard work people of Apata have made it their own heaven .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is a store of rice .
Ten miles long this surface is a living example of their hard work and skill of farming .
With the Kali river its irrigation requirement is fulfilled .
The trees of pine increase the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the sky standing on the horizon in the middle of the snowy mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the cold in the environment there is also a feeling of moisture .
With the sound of waste - waste below the feet the puppets of snow covered on the surface of wood appear .
In the environment there is numbness and because of the blindness of the sunrise before sunrise nothing more was visible .
The eye becomes stable on the redness of the east .
One feels like sitting on the plate lying in the bottom .
On applying hands the smooth puppet of the jaw gets stuck with the sound of ordinary waste and the hands separate from the shock from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending nights coming in this small village situated in the middle of these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third trip in Swiss .
Before this we spent a lot of time or just around it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread very high on ordinary slopes .
This is the main river Rhone valley of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The equivalent highway of the Ron river and the cars running on it are clearly visible .
The distance of 300 kilometres and the journey of two and a half hours from the car is half the way along the Gineva lake and the Ron river coming from the eastern direction along the Ginova lake which is called Lock Larre in French .
100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide Geneva city is situated on the western part of this lake .
From there the lake goes towards the west after forming a river again .
On the left side there are Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain ranges across the lake .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the export of the left side we leave this highway and come on the hilly road towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - face the sun of the afternoon is giving full sunlight .
In comparison to the valley the amount of snow is less here - almost like .
As we move towards the height , density of snow has started increasing .
Despite being frozen good snow on both the sides of the road there is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and bright sun .
After completing the journey of approximately 20 kilometres on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
Chalet slopes are roofed , completely made of wood , large multi-storied bungalows .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , dhobighat along with parking of cars in Bhoyara made of cement cact of three storied bungalow .
Vlai is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This alcohol is the main center of grapes making alcohol .
37  of the whole of the canton is cultivated by grapes on the ground .
The gardens of grapes in the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a magnificent area to the beauty there .
Taking till the garden of grapes roaming around there , taking night rest in the villages there and taking liquor to the liquor factory is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small village named Age there is a very big museum of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to register before .
Once again we come out from the middle of the same jungle which was ruined from Dawanal .
For three - four kilometres on the whole road the mind becomes very upset with the questions happening to the children .
Suddenly on one turn the dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in snow on the flat slope from above the village .
Approximately above the skiing slope the dense forest of Deodar is located till the peak of the mountain .
On all the four sides there is a narrow snow .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are shining because of the fall of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Peace is spread here also .
From the peaks of the mountains to the valleys all around the empire of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reach a big round circle in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , players and health workers coming here can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments with the capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants here .
65 sources of hot water have been found in Luckerabad till now .
40 lac litres -LRB- up to 51o C -RRB- water coming out of them is transported to thermal bridges around small and big 30 places in the entire town , some bridges are inside five star hotels and other income groups are according to the wishes of people .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
In the blooming heat the large surface of snow is shining above the roof of the houses .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can go only taxis of Sikkim therefore checking is not done .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees and plants are the same , the fresh winds are the same .
The moisture on the whole body is the same .
In the weather of rains blue colored light is the same .
As soon as the plan for the journey of Darjeeling was finished , it was first decided to see Karsiang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust forests .
Famous for the production of excellent tea .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome the coming towards itself while remembering .
Crossing through the road amidst tea gardens charms the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side deep green valley .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
All around was the empire of greenery .
Once I fell into unconsciousness , see these natural jungles that the plants of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness was , the more beautiful tea gardens spread far and wide .
If the sight goes on the roads of the road then the world looks marvellous .
The curved and circular path of the snake was passing .
The time was also passing .
If we did not pass , then jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes small towns were seen .
From a distance itself a hill house started looking very dense .
This was Karsiang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of touring the whole day .
Hence taking a car we got out on the tour of Karsiang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the deer park from the top one had to leave the car very below .
Despite being covered with the beauty of Karsyong it could not be developed - famous in the form of a tourist spot .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the lure to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the dust trees was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
Nowadays , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a staired dome here , from the height of which a beautiful scene appears to observe the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women were tired of breaking the tea - leaves running hands very fast by putting hats on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsiag city on which on that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to roam the free environment of this garden .
The next day Darjeeling was decided to roam .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was a great concern from it that if rains were falling like this then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the blooming sunlight .
These gardens , wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers are a beautiful place .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Gangamaya surrounded by hills going a little more below from here .
The mother of waterfalls amidst wide rocks from here is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and wide rocks are charming and the Maavi world of the waterfall in Gangamaya is surrounded by stones .
Both these places are situated very below the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of a car we saw a batsia loop in Darjeeling .
With the help of distance from here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen .
The mood of the weather was clean till now .
But where we moved towards the monastery , it seemed as if we were present and started shining .
In the evening there was an arrangement of touring and shopping on the Mall Road .
Toy train increases the pleasure of traveling in the tour of Darjeeling .
The journey of Toy Train from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake and some rest in the garden here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this route , where hand-made sweaters etc . of Nepalese craftsmen are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong although is a city of Darjeeling district , but its shape - color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but there is a commutation of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of cold , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me here .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor of outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , sometimes there is a special place , water ship or some city like a royal train or a pink city or the Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come dragging .
The place I am going to talk about is just ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place is situated there , it has actually turned into the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for those who stay there .
The words of my guide Ram Babu Mina in my ear , Sahiba before that we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
The resident of Ajabgarh Rambabu used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He had made himself move in a new color to speak .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There nobody calls you from English address .
Aman Bagh is a really peaceful and comfortable tour .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the surrounding areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan some people would have traveled to Bhangarh of Bhutan . Why to go away , some of the Jaipurites may have spent nights in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with a taluka but I could not go .
It is different from the fact that he himself had reached Bhangarh by forgetting the road .
This time suddenly on the invitation of my foreign guests I reached there it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in a short time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is a garden saved from those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to hunt .
Its construction was done in nineteenth century .
Its old wall is a witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees charms you .
The way you come inside the way you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been paid to the divine peace here .
The Mantra of Mangalachar is given a living altitude along with tying cauli in the candle .
We had reached in the evening and we thought of killing one round in front of that garden .
The one who has been a decorator of my guests , suddenly said ,  This is very interesting  .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has also received awards recently .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all journey on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spread gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year rains did not fall but for the first time we saw the cultivation of tobacco .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning and morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep mind .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way of calling Aman Bagh Aajo was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they left us .
Now it has been understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , Tour package is also kept to show tribal life .
Is this right .
Undoubtedly this happens in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
This journey is usually prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Staying there are also included in them .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there was not much development and there was no effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are also places worth seeing for ancient tourists .
Besides this , conventional curiosity is also paid attention .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make tourists experience the way of living and traditions of that place .
Although it looks a little difficult to think , but such a journey is really interesting and makes a different kind of experience .
The bus journey has its own joy .
Despite being with many people from this you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to stop without your favorite book .
Yes , it is necessary that along with giving a lot of time with less expenditure and peace travel definitely demands your patience .
This is the reason that to accept it some things have to be taken care of , especially then some foreign places are going with the help of bus travel .
Before taking the ticket check a good package .
Students , senior men , children etc . of mortality get distributed on them , then there is a facility of relief for two people also .
Although it is cheap to buy tickets beforehand , therefore in the last moments instead of deciding a bus journey it is better that you plan a little before .
Get information about cycling journey without two sides ticket .
It falls cheap .
The rules are specially strict for the goods , therefore ask about the height and weight of the goods .
It does not happen anywhere that you have to leave your luggage at the station or have to pay more fees .
Also know the rules of insurance or compensation from the tourist company .
The bags to keep with it are appropriate , take it .
Because it comes right in horses above the seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to catch the bus reach there one hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat you will have .
While fixing the seat keep in mind the sleeping .
If the shock appears more on the last seat , then it will not be right to read on the next seats .
If you have to go to urine again and again then take a seat with a corner and if you do not like to be more distressed then the window seat will be good for you .
Now it's a walker.
If you are in a firac of two seats then first sit on a corner seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then the event will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while fixing the seat , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Make identification with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat , because the buses do not take responsibility for its loss .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the time .
If you do not come in time , then your place can be found by some new characters and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if Rome has not been seen in Europe then nothing has been seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is among those ancient cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its impression is seen on western lifestyle .
Rome situated on Taibar river is a pilgrimage for the followers of Roman Catholic religion because the main residence of Pope of this religion is in Rome itself .
Old Rome was situated on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , circular wall was built all around it .
The ruins of it can be seen around Rome even today .
Rome is famous worldwide for ancient buildings and their ruins .
This city with grand palace , grand church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps a miracle of attracting you in the first sight .
This huge and unparalleled building of white marble dedicated to the ruler of Italy Victor Imanuel II started in 1885 and its work was completed in 1911 .
In front of it a statue is built in the morning on the horses of Emperor Imanuel , which took 20 years to be built .
Here the unknown soldiers who were martyred in the first world war were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and the victory marks made on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you are interested in art gallery then definitely see it .
Along with the memorial is not only of Rome but also the famous and grand chowk of Italy ' Piaza Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is famous like the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this  Piyatsa de Spagna ' is also very popular among the tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying ' Peaza Venezia ' you must also go to the famous road of Rome i . . Via Del courses .
Large shops , churches and palaces built here enhance the grandeur of this road .
Keep in mind that this road is the main road of Rome .
This second building is built on ' Capitoline Hill ' and is situated at a great height .
Famous sculptor Michael Angelo had built the stairs of climbing on it in 1536 .
In front of Capitaline is the idol of Pittal of Emperor Marcus Orelius on the horses , who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 .
This magnificent idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on the Capitaline is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and old temple are also built in ' Capitaline Complex ' .
The symbol of Rome is colossium .
The construction of this huge architecture was done in 80 AD and here 50 thousand viewers could sit together .
In the colony gladiator i . . Talwarbaj used to show their art .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These fights shivering hearts , whether with other swords or with animals , continued till one of the fighters died .
There were many forums in ancient Rome .
Tell me that places to meet light are called forum in Rome .
Here all the social , religious , economic , political activities of the city used to take place .
Among them the most famous forum was Romanum and the remains of Raj Bhavan , temples and pillars are present even today at this place .
Suddenly after seeing it the grandeur of ancient Rome becomes guessed properly .
Pathian : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open place of 30 feet amidst its huge dome .
Due to this place devotees feel like this , as if their prayers are reaching directly to the gods .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are built all around .
Although in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum built here also because by leaving it you will lose the opportunity to face the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and it feels so alive as if they start speaking just now .
Here a idol lying on the column of the nepolian predecessor Paulin , whose marriage was done in the Borgis royal family looks so alive that you will unite for a few moments without seeing you can not stay .
The special attraction of Rome is his fountain .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which grand fountains are made .
The most famous fountain here is ' Travey Fountain ' .
It is believed that if you want to come to Rome again then you should put it in a coin fountain with this wish .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed till you see ' Vatican City ' .
Since the sixth century this place has been the residence of the highest religious chief ' Pope ' of the followers of Roman Catholic religion .
Although this is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Look at the famous St . Peter Church , St . Peter Square , Fountain , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Of course you will show you the scene of a different world and will give you a feeling of always remembering .

On the roads of Goa Cycling , River Cruise , Cold Sea winds and world famous Goan cuisines enjoying comfortable days , the jinger hotel situated here is an excellent option .
If seen in today 's date then for Maldives the fare of returning the cheapest person from Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male and even then you can get hotels in less rent but go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the knife will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise started the only sea cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo from Kochi .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very small in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now established its services , but there is a possibility of its recurrence from October .
On the ship of Louis Christ M . . Aquamerin you can go on a tour of Maldives for three days at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person at night .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children below 15 years of age are absolutely free .
What else should you want .
Tea - breakfast , food are included in the rent of Christ .
With the entertainment of every time .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your wishes - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a sea plane is standing in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like sports .
But this train with 12 - 15 seats is excellent in an undisputed way for touring island groups like Ooter Plan Maldives .
On the surface of water running like a speed boat when it flys in the air , it does not even know .
In the whole of the flight you do not feel the flight of ordinary airplanes .
Every time your sight remains below the window , watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shadows of Maldives .
Everything looks clear .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of them which has a sea plane .
If you want then you can travel around four thousand rupees -LRB- person daily -RRB- for an hour or you can take the whole sea plane on rent for your whole day tour .
Although if you go to any island before Male Island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the same way of journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which the mind to complete may never do to you .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- best Mavilevaru -RRB- to the islands of Maldives .
We were in the most ancient and memorable shops the capital of the Ahmadi market of Male .
All the sellers were listening very carefully to the speech given in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasheed .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of Presidents or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of an excellent structure of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have understood the meeting made inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but on going to Maldives it feels as if the cup of nature snatched it from us then how far the world will become .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In this small country as if such beauty is not sufficient .
On returning from that tour of the market towards the jetty to go to its cruise when the sight went to the water of the sea running along the unnecessary road then it felt as if the people here understood the price of this beauty to how much .
The water was so clear that in the light of the lamppost fishes swimming in several metres deep below were visible with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres in the water of the sea or river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself lucky .
On returning to M . . Aquamrin two hours of the evening spent in Male were roaming around in the brain .
Coral Reef -LRB- stones of parallel -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones laid on the graves you will find stones of layers .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nasheed we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security personnel till far .
With joy we were taking photographs of gardens and sky approximately 50 metres away by spreading hands inside the gate of their bungalow .
Can you think this about the house of a common leader in India .
It was also found that the President sometimes crossing the road on foot reaches his office ahead two blocks .
Everything was amazing about Maldives .
Therefore I was waiting for the next day with patience .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the bus of Trans Maldives while cutting the round of the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing through above .
He had seen so much pictures.
But then it was not known that the next day there would be a chance of riding in it .
From the sea plane of Trace Maldives we had to go to Rangali Island one hundred and a half kilometres away .
Hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives were unforgettable to see from the sea plane flying till a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached another world .
In such a world which had no relation with any outside world .
The relation was not in such a way that it was difficult to find out the beauty or villaita there .
Walking on Konarad can also be done on foot or also by a battery-driven car .
The view of Jaljivan on both sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Now we were unable to hear ourselves easily from the nature nearby , that we reached such a place , it was impossible .
On descending several metres below the stairs we reached such a glass room which was inside the water .
That room was actually a food block .
On all the sides we were able to see people doing unique types of small and big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of food sitting on the decorated table was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting and lunching underwater on this island in Male to Sea Plan is only 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no mind to return from there .
We were ready to bathe in the water of our fame .
But we knew it was not possible .
Returning with that desire with heavy mind , sometimes , at some point the luck will definitely be taken here .
For many days plans were being made to go out of Delhi but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
Since childhood there was a fun of wildlife then we thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second luck tour after biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla in Laddakh .
On the afternoon of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the journals that came out of the journal destroyed our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dhummas from above and bad road in front .
Many times it felt that now we fell .
After doing anything we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Although we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara Resort Park was in Dhikuli , whose name we had already been given .
On that day there was no special program but we came to roam at the edge of Kosi before getting cold .
After spending two - three hours there we went out of the Corbett Museum , which was near the Dhangadi gate very difficult 2 kilometres away .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar below .
The evening turned back .
It was decided from Delhi that if you would definitely see the lions roaming open in the jungle then I would see a tiger all night in dreams .
In the midst of a deep night suddenly I felt a tremendous roar and after that the dogs who started roaming did not stop for two hours .
Therefore first information came to visit Kaladhungi and Carbert waterfalls .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away , while Corbett waterfall comes on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to their own life are kept .
On coming and coming we got around twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was living in this very village .
On reaching the resort safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have made arrangements for sighting in the number one side businessmen there .
On asking about number one we told that there is more grassland and tigers come towards this side to escape from cold during this period .
On reaching Bijra we were given a guidance , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours roaming .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , whose long teeth were .
I photographed properly .
In the middle of them the guide started following the tiger .
The guide said that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was in the morning .
Then I remembered one of my old friends of Haldwan .
I made him the same phone .
I told him that I am in carbot .
He asked whether the tiger was seen or not .
Its word was like a arrow .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a journey for inside .
