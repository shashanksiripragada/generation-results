Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On one side of Kutch , Sind and on the other side Gujarat are therefore a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
By the way it is ' dialect ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi , you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the whole city has collapsed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same way from which we had come then we will have to take a complete one month 's holiday and there the school will open in Bombay .
So what to do  Now we will travel in the train by calling the fast buses of Gujarat Tata .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
A small train of meter gauge from there will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing terrorist threats in South Asia , the tourism business has been deeply pushed .
From the point of view of tourism a lot of reduction has been recorded in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan being included in the major states of the country these days .
The latest figures released recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has come down by more than ten percent compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of native tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 nationals and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers , says that global recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected the tourism business .
We have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism in comparison to other countries of Asia .
This is the reason that in the number of foreign tourists coming to India also there has been a decline of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With regard to tourism recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , bavadiyas , forests everything is the same old to enjoy the tourists .
In the tourism sector the talk of working on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism is done by all the governments but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very little .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of rape and molestation have also stained the image of this state at the international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in the state but it has remained confined to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan Government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) .
With the aim of promoting tourism in Rajasthan and developing tourism infrastructure , the Rajasthan Government formed RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of housing , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
The corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
The deficit of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakhs which is estimated to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels of this corporation is that even forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled in the last five years .
Along with the hotels the other units of the corporation are also making it a big loss .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
The attraction of tourists towards this train could not be made .
Despite reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a reduction in the interest of tourists towards Pushkar Fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists stayed , this number decreased to 217 this year .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth in the attraction of the tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . the royal train .
This railway is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC benefited Rs . 9 . 5 crore from this train .
Due to this decline in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his heart , he can produce gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by establishing modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had seen , seeing the progress of day and day , his eyes reflect happiness .
His happiness was also seen at the inauguration of the private airport of Ambay Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley has started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place as a good city .
In this city spread over more than 10 , 000 acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been built only on 9  land .
91 per cent of land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Several industrialists came forward to build their homes in this city built for millionaires and today there are about 800 families living in this city .
Initially industrialists and royals bought their Asians here in the form of Hollyday Home , but now it has made its first house and from here they make a movement of Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambay Valley itself is Koyrigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Likawali are very important in western Siang district .
Remains of a large temple are found in excavation .
On the pillars of stones of this temple idols of lotus and goddesses have been excavated which are mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this region .
At this place a Dashabhuja statue of Goddess Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are popular among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tameshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the glory of the goddess Tameshwari is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognized far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also offered here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins are found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the terrain between the Dibang and the Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular stories here this place is old Vidarbha , where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place in the Lohit district .
Digaru , Mishmi etc . tribes here guide travellers .
These people themselves have great faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far and wide come here .
Besides the above ruins described as the pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roeing are still telling their story .
The ruins of bathing ghats , pucca stairs and another pond surrounded by pucca ponds and getting ruins of wide - wide roads are still singing the silence of their ancient magnificence .
From the upper Assam city North Lakhimpur we reach ero for four hours by jeep .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotise the visitors .
This is the same charming place where emergency lives .
It used to take several days to reach here before the jeep road was built .
On reaching here the views of high cedar trees , beautiful premeroze , vaolet , wild curtains , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the coming .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of emergency people .
Emergency people have made it their heaven with their tireless hard work .
Rice cultivation is very much here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of their hard work and cultivation efficiency .
The need for irrigation is met from the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon between the snow laden mountain range of the left hand .
It is very cold in the air .
Along with the chilling cold one also feels moisture in the environment .
With the sound of garbage below the feet one gets to see the layer of legs laid on the floor of wood .
The atmosphere is neem and the dusty shadow before sunrise is not visible much .
Eyes remain on the redness of the East .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
The smooth layer of the leg shines with the sound of a light scream and the hand gets separated from the shock with the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village settled between these hills buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time was spent in Geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both sides of the thin Balkhati river is spread very high on light slopes .
This is the valley of Rhone the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
On the parallel highway of the Ron river and the trains ringing on it have begun to make it clear .
The journey of 300 kms away and half an hour from the car is half the way then along with the parallel of Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the east along with the Geneva lake near the city named Montreu which is called Lock Lama -LRB- Lock Lama -RRB- .
Geneva city is settled at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves towards the west .
On the right side there are mountain ranges of Dhawal , Alps -LRB- Alps -RRB- .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the exit of the left side we come on the hilly road towards the north , leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward , the sun of Aparahan is giving full sunshine to the whole of the wings .
The quantity of snow is less than the valley - almost no equal .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good snow being frozen on both sides of the road there is no special cold in the air due to clear sky and shining sun .
On this curved hill road we reach a small village named Thel by traveling about 20 kms in half an hour .
Halet - There are big multi-storey bungalows made of wood completely with slopy roofs .
The basement made of cement concrete in the three - storied bungalow has rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladry , including parking of trains .
The turn is famous for the cultivation of grapes in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grapes .
37  of the whole canton is cultivated by grapes .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to the beauty there .
Taking the gardens of grapes -LRB- wine ards -RRB- to the bottom , roaming around them , taking night rest in the villages there and taking them to the factories of grapes wine testing is an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of grapes liquor in a fort built in 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get incomplete booking .
Once again , we pass through the middle of the same jungle , as we smoke from Damanal .
Through the way up to three - four kms the mind gets even more sad with the buzzing questions of the children .
Suddenly dramatic and pleasant changes come from the scene at a turn .
Right in front , on the upper slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful slope of houses is settled .
People are skiing in the snow on a flat slope from above the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
Dense snow is lying all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining because of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same silence remains here as well .
From the peak of the mountain all around to the valley the empire of Dhawal snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a round about in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Lukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 apartments and halets with capacity of 6900 beds , 28 hotels , camping sites of tents , 90 bed health center and 50 restaurants .
65 sleeps of hot water have been found in Luckerabad till now .
Thermal pools of about 40 lakh litres - LRB - up to 51 o ' clock -RRB- coming out of these are delivered to thermal pools of about 30 small and big pools in the whole town of water , some pools are within five star hotels and others are according to the pockets of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
The thick layer of snow is shining on the roof of the houses in the blooming sunlight .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved as a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that only taxis of Sikkim can go , therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees are the same , the floating winds are there .
It is the moisture that lays on the whole body .
In the rainy season the surmai light is the same .
As soon as the plan for a visit to Darjeeling was confirmed , the first glimpse of Karsyang was spread .
Karsiang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dry forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
When we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves smiling .
Passing through the road between tea gardens charms for the first time .
On one hand the green mountain filled with jungles , on the other side the deep green ditch .
Here sometimes the jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
The empire of greenery was all around .
Once I was hampered , look at these natural forests or tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread far and wide .
If the sight goes on the streets of the road then the creation looks amazing .
The snake ' s move was crooked and the circular path was going on .
The time was also passing .
The forest and tea gardens were not going on .
Sometimes small settlements appear .
A hilly house , house etc . was seen very dense from afar .
It was Karsiyag .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming all day .
Therefore we left on a tour of Karsiang taking a car .
First of all , deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
The climb was above i . . to reach Deer Park the car had to be left very low .
Though Karsiang is very beautiful , it has not yet developed as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the road being deserted the greed of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the dry trees was giving us courage .
The next place was the eagle crag .
This is a point located at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to jump from here and give life .
At present , it is a park and with restaurants .
There is a stair like dome here at a height of which a beautiful view is present on observing the whole city .
In tea gardens around , women were busy breaking the tea leaf carrying hands with a basket load on the back .
There is a museum outside Karsiang city , but on that day we could not go there because touring the free environment of tea gardens was more important .
The next day it was decided to roam around Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very worried about how we would roam around if the rain continued .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the rock garden we roamed enjoying sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place charming with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more pleasant .
On moving a little more down from here we got Gangamaya surrounded by hills .
Here amidst rocks the maya of the waterfalls is worth seeing .
In the rock garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and rocks are spectacular then the Mayavi world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is decorated with stones .
Both of these places are situated very below the hills of Darjeeling .
We got up with the help of the car and saw the Botsia Loop in Darjeeling .
From here the whole hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of telescope .
The mood of the weather was still smooth .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , from where we came down and glittered .
In the evening there was a plan to walk on the mall road and shopping .
During the tour of Darjeeling the trains put four moons in the journey .
The journey of train from Darjeeling to roam and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for the tourists .
Here in Mirik lake boating and slight rest in the garden .
From this route tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar , where Nepalese artisans get handmade sweaters etc .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its variety is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but movement of jungles and waterfalls here .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lava and Lolegaon , which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam Darjeeling in the shade of cold , but tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me to themselves .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not foreign or outside Rajasthan , but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes a special place , a ship of water or a royal train or a city like a pink city or a lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of a particular attraction people come to drag .
The place I am going to talk about has just been prepared about four and a half years ago , but the preparation with which this place has come there has really made mangal in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who live there .
In my ears my guide resonates the words of Ram Babu Meena : ' Before that we could not even think that we could live in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not even get work in the Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajabgarh , worked in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style , Aman Bagh .
He has dragged his own speech into a new color .
Sahiba ' is the idea of Aman Bagh .
There no one calls you from English enlightenment .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces you to the nearby areas .
How many of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhangarh of the ghosts  Why should I go away , some of the people of Jaipur would probably have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember the night when Shabana Azmi had called me there with Tahdil but I could not go .
It is different that he himself had gone astray and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the feast of my foreign guest , then it felt that those who want to spend a magnificent holiday in less time they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
It was built in nineteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh , surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees , hypnotise you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed , it feels that the divine peace has been paid attention here .
In the wrist , the mantra of Mangalachar is pronounced alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening and we intended to set up a round of garden .
My host Jackey , who was a decorator , suddenly said , This is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new artistic  No wonder that Aman Bagh has recently got the award .
The manager fixed our programme for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey of Bhangarh .
We saw the fort of Ajbgarh walking on a narrow road on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco cultivation .
For Jackie , such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are millions of dollars invaluable moments .
The way to say goodbye to Aman Bagh was traditional , jaggery and curd , they left us .
Now it was understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also kept to show Tribal life .
Is it right
Of course and this happens in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
These tours are generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been a lot of development and where time has not had a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time where old tourist sites etc are also present .
Besides , attention is also paid to serve the Traditional Kusin .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists understand the ways and traditions of living at that place .
Although it looks a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own fun .
Despite being with a lot of people from this you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time to your favorite book without destruction .
Yes , it is of course so much that along with giving a lot of time less expensive and comfortable these tours definitely keep your demand for patience .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to take care of some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through a tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children etc . get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of exemption for two people also .
By the way , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , therefore in the last moments it is better to plan a little before bus tour .
To know about round trips instead of tickets .
They are cheaper .
The rules regarding the baggage are very strict , therefore inquire about the size and weight of the luggage .
It should not be such that you have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or have to pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensating insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take .
Because they fit in the rack over the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing bus during tour you will have the responsibility of luggage .
Where you have to take the bus , reach there one hour before time .
During the busy season you take special care of this .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat option will be with you .
Keep in mind the confert while choosing the seat .
If there are more shocks in the previous seat , then reading in the next seats is not confined .
If you have to go to Lu again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more distracted then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it ' s a clever thing .
If you both are in a round of grab , sit on the corner seat and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planning will be successful .
If there is a facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind that while chewing the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make the identity of the driver and conductor only .
Thus you will get very important information from them .
During the cleaning of the bus all are asked to go out .
During this time do not leave your luggage on the seat , because on its disappearance busmen do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then a new passenger can get your place and you will have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
It is said that if Rome is not seen in Europe , nothing has been seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is among those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .

By the way , this temple was built in 601 AD .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore do not forget to see it when you go to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum built here too , because on missing it you will lose the chance of getting ready with the best sculpture .
The statues built here are unique and look so alive as if they will speak now .
Here a idol lying on the bed of the sister of Napoleon first , Paulin , who was married in the Borgis royal family , looks so alive that you will not be able to stay without seeing it alone for some time .
The special attraction of Rome is its fountains .
There are approximately 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are made .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevi Fountain ' .

Ginger Hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend comfortable days while enjoying cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan dishes on the roads of Goa .
If you see in today 's date then for Maldives the cheapest return fare from Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then even then you can get hotels in a little fare but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives goes to any island nearby then pocket will become small .
C cruise proves beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis cruise from Kochi started India ' s only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis Cruise is a European company and is very popular in cruise and hotel business .
Though due to some difficulties Louis Cruise has just postponed his services , but they are expected to start again from October .
On the ship of Louis Cruise M . . Aquarein you can go to Maldives for three days cruise at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person per night .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are older , children below the age of 15 are absolutely free .
What else do you want .
The cruise rent includes tea - breakfast , food .
Entertainment of every time together .
On reaching Capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from C plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a plane suddenly stands in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like toys .
But this tiven Oter Plane with 12 - 15 seats is excellent unquestionably for roaming archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
When it gets up in the air while running like a speed boat on the surface of water , it is not known .
You do not experience the flight of common airplanes in the whole flight .
Every time your eyes are stronger below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different sheds of Maldives .
Everything is clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Trass is one of these , which has twenty C planes .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the whole of the plane on rent for the difference of your day -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
If you go to any island beyond Male Island then the journey of C plane will be necessary because this is the means of journey between different islands .
And that ' s a journey that may never have your mind to end .
C planes travel from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in the north -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenire shop of the capital in the Ahmedi market of Male .
All the salesmen were listening to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nashid in the World Climate Conference in Copenhagen a day before .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Hindustani listening to the speeches of the Presidents or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unnatural creation of this earth , it was so serious .
Many people may have considered the meeting of the Maldives cabinet in the water in October , but going to Maldives it seems that if the wrath of nature snatchs it from us then how poor the world will become .
Something similar is special in the beauty there .
In that small country , it does not seem to have such a beauty .
Returning towards Jetty to go back from that tour of the market to its cruise , when the eyes went to the water of the sea along the Barbas road then it was realized that the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that the floating fish in a depth of several metres below the light of the lamppost was visible with all its colors .
It was a part of the ocean which was completely attached to the city .
If you can see a few centimetres clearly in the water of the sea or river adjacent to any city of India then you will find yourself lucky .
While returning to M . V . Aquamarin , he was roaming in the garland for two hours in the evening .
Coral reef -LRB- Muga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones on the tombs you will get muga rocks .
Just a while before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the supreme personality of any country , there was no security worker far and wide .
With fun we were taking photographs of gardens and verandahs just fifty metres away by taking our hands inside from the door of his bungalow .
Can you think of a leader ' s house in India
It was also known that the President sometimes reached his office two blocks ahead crossing the roads on foot .
Everything about the Maldives was about to be overwhelming .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was Ilham that the day was about to be special .
In the morning a boat from cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached Trass on the base of Maldives cutting the runway .
Last evening when Cruise was reaching near Male we immediately recognized the sea plane passing through .
So many pictures that had seen .
But then it was not supposed that the next day it would get a chance to ride .
We were going to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the C plane of the Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying till a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was an adventurous and exciting flight to breathe .
But on reaching the Conrade Resort of Hilton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In a world that had no access to any outside world .
It was not in such a way that it was difficult to get out the beauty or luxury there .
Tour on Konrad can also be done on foot or by battery driven car .
While going from Jetty to main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was amazing .
We were not able to make ourselves even comfortable with the nature of the surroundings , that we had reached such a place , was unimaginable .
While descending in the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
The room was actually a dining room .
On all sides across the glass we could see people of unique types of small fishes , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting this island from Male to C plane and lunching underwater is only Rs . 47 thousand for a man .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to drive our passports into water .
But he knew it was not possible .
We returned with this hope with heavy mind that sometimes , at some point the fate will definitely be brought here .
He was planning to go out of Delhi for several days but it was not possible because of the busyness of work .
If there was a hobby of wildlife since childhood then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
This was the second bike tour in Ladakh in 2006 after biking from Khardungla Pass to Pegong Lake .
In the morning of December 27 , we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the fog that came out of the jeopardy rushed to our speed .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tired .
Fog from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it seemed to have fallen .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special programme , despite being cold , we first went to roam the coast of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we got out of Corbett Museum , which was very difficult near Dhangadi Gate 2 kms away .
From there we went to roam around Ramnagar below .
It was late in the evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if I would definitely see a lion roaming a holiday in the jungle then I would see a lion in the dream of the whole night .
Suddenly in the midst of the depths of the night , I heard a tremendous roar , and after that the dogs who started shouting did not stop for two hours .
So before Kaladhungi and Corbett Fall suggested to roam around .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away while Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
Returning at twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled on coming to this village .
On reaching the resort the safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that he has arranged siteing in the number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one it was told that there is more grassland and during this time tigers come to the same side to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide who takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two smuggler elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
Guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
In many places we also saw marks of their claws , but I was sad to see the tiger not .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind , Tiger ' s Fitur was riding .
I remembered Haldwani ' s old friend .
I called him like this .
I told him that I am in Corbett .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
Her words shouted like an arrow .
I said gradually , No .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside .
