Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it ' s different .
On the one side of Kutch , Sind and Gujarat on the other , therefore , there is a mixture of both in languages .
This is called ' kachhi ' .
Well , it ' s a ' dialect ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi , you have to write in the Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is the Anjar city where earthquakes have occurred many times and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisal - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the same way from which we had come then we will have to take a holiday of the whole month and on the other hand schools will open in Bombay .
So what to do  Now the fast buses of Gujarat will travel in the train by calling TATA .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge will reach Bombay from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry , considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan , is passing through bad times these days .
Due to global recession and increasing terror threats in South Asia tourism business has been deeply pushed .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan to be included in the major states of the country has been recorded a lot these days .
Recent statistics released by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent compared to 2008 .
According to statistics the number of indigenous tourists has come down by 9 . percent and the number of foreign tourists has come down by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 indigenous and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
These included two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 indigenous and one lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputana Holiday Makers says that global recession and terrorist incidents have badly affected the tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
In terms of tourism recent years have passed best for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
From the point of view of tourism nothing new has happened .
Desert , havelis , forts , buffaloes , jungles everything is the same old for tourists .
In the tourism sector all the governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very little facilities .
At the same time in recent years incidents of rape and tampering in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists have also made the image of this state spotted at the international level .
Years ago the Rajasthan government had given the status of industry to tourism in the state but it has been confined to paper only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited ( RTDC ) .
The Government of Rajasthan had constituted RTDC in 1979 with the objective of promoting tourism and developing tourism infrastructure in Rajasthan .
This corporation provides the facilities of housing , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
The Corporation has a total of 75 units .
In which 39 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
The RTDC deficit in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years even forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels the other units of the corporation are also reaching it a big loss .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
There was no attraction of tourists towards this railway .
Despite decreasing rent it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a lack of interest in tourists towards Pushkar Mela .
In the year 2007 - 08 in the tourist village built by RTDC where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year this number decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there is no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This train is constantly benefiting .
Last year, RTDC got a benefit of Rs 9.5 crore from this railway.
With this decline in the tourism sector in Rajasthan , it is natural to see the worries of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his heart , he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it true by setting up modern city Ambo Valley in the mountain range of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had dreamed is glorious in his eyes , looking forward day by day .
His happiness was also visible during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambay Valley started and today Ambay Valley has been able to make its place in the form of a great city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres only 9 percent of the land hotels , houses and other facilities have been set up .
91 per cent of land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Several industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city built for millionaires only and today about 800 families are living in this city .
Initially industrialists and rices bought their ashes in the form of Hollyday Home but now they have made it their first house and from here they commute Mumbai for work .
Behind the Ambe Valley is the Koyrigarh Fort which provides the beauty of this area .
The ruins of Likawali are very important in the western Siang district .
The ruins of a large temple are found in the excavation .
On the pillars of the stones of this temple the excavation of the idols of lotus and goddesses has been obtained which are mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this region .
At this place a decimal idol of goddess Durga has been found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the glorious story of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the glory of Tamreshwari goddess is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was believed far and wide in the north - eastern hills .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was also done which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the midst of Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories prevalent here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where at one time King Bhishmak ruled .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place in Lohit district .
The Digaru , Mishmi etc tribes here guide the passengers .
These people themselves have great reverence to this well .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The remains of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
Ghats of bathing , paved stairs and other ponds surrounded by cooked curtains and getting the remains of wide roads are still singing silence of their ancient grand stories .
We reach ero for four hours by jeep from the city of Upper Assam North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place charms the heart of the visitors .
This is the same charming place where emergency lives .
It takes several days to reach here before the way of jeep was made .
On reaching here the views of high deodar trees , beautiful premrose , vollet , wild curtains , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the people coming .
Apple and peanuts are produced here a lot .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of emergency people .
Emergency people have made it their heaven with their tireless hard work .
There is a lot of rice cultivation here .
This place is a store of rice .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of their hard work and skill to cultivate .
The necessity of irrigation is met by the Kali river .
The trees of pine put four moons in the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the light redness emerging in the sky on the horizon in the middle of the snow covered mountain range of the left hand .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with cool brightness in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of bitterness below the feet on the layer of the wooden layer is seen .
In the atmosphere , there is no necessity , and there is no more visible because of the blurred shadow before the sunrise .
The eyes remain on the redness of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench lying in the balcony .
The smooth layer of the palm gets shaken with the sound of a slight garment and the hand gets separated from the shock from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled in the middle of these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent in Geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on either side of the thin Balkhati river is spread very high on light slopes .
This is the valley of Rhone , the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
On the parallel highway of the Ron river and crawling trains on it have begun to clear .
The distance of 300 kms and the journey of two and a half hours from the car , along with the parallel of the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from eastern direction , near the city named Montreu , Geneva lake which is called Lack Lama in French .
Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake 100 km long and 10 km wide .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after forming a river .
On the right side of the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke from the left side exit we come on the mountainous path of the north , leaving this highway .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward , the sun of the slope is giving full sunlight to the whole wing .
The quantity of snow is less here than the valley - almost not equal .
As soon as the height moves towards , the density of snow has started increasing .
There is no special coolness in the air because of the clear sky and the bright sun despite the accumulation of good snow on both the sides of the road .
On this circular hilly road the journey of approximately 20 kms in half an hour we reach a small village named Thel .
Shailat -LRB- halet -RRB- - with slopy roofs , large storied bungalows made of wood are completely .
The basement made of the cement concrete of the three - storied bungalow has a room to control the required services like electricity , water , ladries , including parking of trains .
Valai is famous for grapes cultivation in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of grapes making alcohol .
Grapes are cultivated at 37  of the entire Canton ' s land .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes give a wonderful dimension to the beauty there .
Taking wine cards underground , roaming around them is an integral part of the tourism business here by taking them to the vineyards of grapes and taking them to the factory of grapes .
In a small town named Aigle there is a very big museum of grapes in Hateau built in the 12th century , to see which foreign tourists have to get artificial booking .
Once again , we pass through the same jungle , which has been ruined from the davanal .
Throughout the way up to three - four k . . the mind becomes even more sad by the questions of the children .
Suddenly , a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the slope above the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing -LRB- skiing -RRB- in snow on a flat slope from above the village .
The dense jungle of deodar is spread above the skiing slope till the peak of the mountain .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining due to the direct sun rays .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley all around the empire of Dhawal snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round circuit in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Luckerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet above the sea level the population of Lukarbad is approximately 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here , sportsmen and healthy people can be estimated from this point that there are 1700 apartments and halets with the capacity of 6900 beds to stay here 28 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 sleepers of hot water have been found in Luckerbad so far .
About 40 lakh litres ( up to 51  ) of water coming out of them are transported to thermal pools of small and big 30 , some pools are within five star hotels and others according to the pockets of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
The thick bottom of snow is shining above the roof of the houses in the blooming sun .
Albenin is the name of this village .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go to Sikkim therefore checking is not done .
The journey continues , the state is the second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the sarasrati winds are there .
The moisture of the whole body is the same .
During the rainy season the sunlight is the same .
As soon as the plan for the journey of Darjeeling was confirmed , it was first spread to take a look at Karsiang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of sunlight jungle .
Famous for the best tea production .
While moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , in the beginning itself tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves smiling .
In the middle of tea gardens passing through the road charms the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles , on the other side deep green ditch .
Sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen here .
There was a greenery empire all around .
Once I was disturbed , see these natural jungles or tea plants planted by man .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The more beautiful the jungle was , the more beautiful the tea garden spread far and wide .
If the sight goes on the roads of the road then the creation looks amazing .
The snake ' s crooked and vertical path was passing through .
The time was also over .
If not , the forest and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlement was seen .
From a distance , a hill house , etc . appeared very dense .
It was Curseyag .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
Hence taking a car we got out on a tour of Karsiang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles all around .
To reach the deer park the car had to be left very low .
Despite the beauty of Karsiang , it has not yet been developed as a tourist destination .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite the path being deserted the greed to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the way between the trees of sunshine was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the era of the British lovers used to jump from here and give life .
At present , it is equipped with a park and restaurant .
There is a stair like dome here on observing the entire city from the height of which a beautiful scene is present .
In the tea gardens nearby women were busy in breaking the tea leaf running hands with a basket on the back .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsiang , but on that day we could not go there , because it seemed more necessary to tour the environment free of tea gardens .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was a great concern that if it was raining then how would we roam .
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming .
On moving a little more down from here Gangamaya was found surrounded by hills .
The magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks is worth seeing here .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls are decorated in the empire of stones and rocks then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is engraved with stones .
Both of these places are standing very below the hills of Darjeeling .
On getting up with the help of the car , we saw the balancing loop in Darjeeling .
From here the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of binoculars .
The weather mood was smooth till now .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , they appeared from where to be reduced and began to shine .
In the evening there was a plan to walk and shopping on the malroad .
In the tour of Darjeeling travel trains put four moons in the journey .
The journey from Darjeeling to roam and from Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and slight rest in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters etc . of Nepalese artisans are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is the only city in Darjeeling district , but its color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spots in Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of jungle - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam around Darjeeling in the shade of cold , but the tea garden spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with ourselves .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither abroad nor outside Rajasthan but very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes travels towards itself , somewhere special place , water ship or some royal train or some city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Due to some special attraction people drive away .
The place I am going to talk is just ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation of which this place has come there , it has actually made it desolate in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there , but also for those who live there .
In my ears , my guide sings the words of Ram Babu Meena : ' Saheb could not even think that we could live in the jungle before .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not get any work in the Heritage Hotel .
Ram Babu , a resident of Ajabgarh , used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal style Aman Bagh .
He has driven his own words into a new colour .
Sahiba is the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There no one invites you from English .
Aman Bagh is a really peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
That garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
How many of the people who spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhangarh of the ghosts  Why should I go away , some of the people of Jaipur would probably have spent night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I remember the night when Shabana Azmi had called me there from Tahedil but I could not go .
It is different from the fact that he himself had gone astray and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there on the feast of my foreign guests , then it felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stop for hunting .
It was built in nineteen , hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh , surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees , attracts you .
As soon as you come in , the way you are welcomed , it feels that divine peace has been focused here .
The mantra of Mangalachara is pronounced alive along with the binding of a mule in the wrist .
We had reached the slope in the evening and intended to set up a round of gardens .
My host , Jackie , who was an honorary person , suddenly said , It is interesting .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is artistic on new . No wonder that Aman Bagh has recently received awards .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all , a walk with Ram Babu and then a jeep journey to Bhangarh .
Walking on a narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain , but for the first time I saw the cultivation of tobacco .
Such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience for Jackie .
After that we reached Bhangarh from the jeep .
In the morning I had seen a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
These are millions of dollars invaluable moments .
The way to say goodbye to Aman Bagh was also traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd he left us .
Now it came to understand why the tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept to show Tribal Life .
Is it true
Of course , this happens in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in them .
These tours are usually prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and where time has not had a special effect on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Also where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides , attention is also given to serving the triditional cousin .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists face the ways of living and traditions of that place .
Although it looks a little difficult to think , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own fun .
Despite being with many people from this you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without disturbing .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving less expenditure and comfortable time these tours definitely keep the demand of patience with you .
This is the reason why it is important to take care of some things to enjoy them , especially when you are watching a foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children , etc . get discount on them , then there is an arrangement of exemption for two people also .
By the way , it is cheap to buy tickets in advance , so in the last moments it is better to plan bus tours that planning should be done a little before .
To know about round trips instead of tickets .
They are cheaper .
Rules regarding baggage are very hard , so inquire about the size and weight of the goods .
It should not be so that you have to leave some of your goods on the terminal or pay extra fees .
Also know the rules of compensating for insurance or loss from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , take them .
because they fit in the rake above the seat .
Keep in mind that while changing the bus during the tour the responsibility of the goods will be yourself .
From where you have to take a bus reach there one hour before time .
During the busy season you should take special care of this .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better seat option you will have .
Keep in mind the comfort while choosing the seat .
If there are more shocks in the previous seat , then it is not confirmable to read in the next seats .
If you have to go to Lu repeatedly , then take a seat with the corner and if you do not like to be too distressed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now it ' s a trick .
If both of you are in the clutches , then sit on the corner seat beforehand and keep your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while snatching the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Make identification from the bus driver and conductor .
You will thus get very important information from them .
Everyone is asked to go out during the cleaning of the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage in the seat , because if it is lost , the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back on time .
If you do not come on time , you can find a new passenger in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .
They say that if Rome was not seen in Europe , nothing was seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
The capital of Italy Rome is one of those old cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .

Pathion . This wonderful ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open space of 30 feet in the middle of its huge dome .
Due to this place the devotees felt as if their prayers are directly reaching the gods .
Inside the temple idols of gods and goddesses are made all around .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore on going to Rome do not forget to see it .
Definitely go to the museum made here too , because on missing it you will lose the opportunity to face the best sculpture .
The idols built here are unique and it feels so alive as if they will speak right now .
Here a idol lying on the bed of Napoleon ' s first sister Paulin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , seems so alive that you will not be able to live without seeing it alone for a few moments .
The special attraction of Rome is its fountains .
There are about 300 buildings here in which magnificent fountains are built .
The most famous fountain here is ' Trevi Fountain ' .
It is believed that if someone wants to come back to Rome , he should be put into a coin fountain with this desire .
It is believed that by doing so this desire is surely fulfilled .

Although it is in Rome itself , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Look at the famous St . Peter Church , St . Peter Square , Fountains , Museum etc . of Vatican City .
Of course , they will show you the view of a different world and will give you a memorable experience .

Cycling , rever cruise , cold sea winds and world famous govan foods on the roads of Goa are the best options to spend comfortable days here .
If you see in today 's date then the cheapest return fare for Maldives from Delhi is of 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then even then you can get hotels in some less rent but if you go to some island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then the pocket will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December , Louis cruise from Kochi started the only cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very well - known in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis cruise has postponed its services yet , but it is expected to start again from October .
On the ship of Louis Cruise M . . Aquarin you can go to Maldives for three days cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person per night .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if two are old then children under 15 years of age are absolutely free .
And what else should be .
The fare of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food .
The entertainment of every time together .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from sea plane ride to underwater lunch .
If a plane suddenly stands in front of you while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like a toy .
But this twin overplane of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in an undisputed way to roam around Archipelego -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
It is not known when it rises in the air , running like a speed boat on the surface of water .
You don ' t have the experience of flying ordinary airplanes in the entire flight .
Every time your eyes remain strong below the window - watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different shades of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of these which has 20 C planes .
If you want then you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- for an hour or you can take the whole plane for your fate -LRB- provided the pocket is deep -RRB- .
By the way if you go beyond Male Island on any island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that ' s a journey which ' s going to end , maybe you ' ll never do it .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- at the best in Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovanier shop of the capital in Ahmedi Bazar of Male .
All salesmans were listening to the speech given by the President Mohammad Nashid of Maldives one day before in Copenhagen at the World Climate Conference with great attention .
If I say honestly then I did not see any Indian listening to the speeches of Presidents or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there was a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth , it was so serious .
Many people may have considered the meeting in the water of the Maldives in October , but the Maldives feels that if the fury of nature snatchs it from us , the world will be very poor .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
In that small country , as if it was not so beautiful .
Returning from that tour of the market towards Jetty to go back to its cruise , when the eyes went in the water of the sea walking along with the barbarous road then it felt as if the people here understand the price of this beauty to what extent .
The water was so clear that the fish floating in the depth of several meters below the lamppost were visible with all its colors .
It was a part of the sea which was attached to the city .
You will find yourself luck even if you can see some centimeters in the water of the sea or river adjacent to any city of India .
While returning to MV Aquamarin , spent two hours in the evening roaming around in the garland .
Coral reef -LRB- moonga rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones on the graves you will get copper rocks .
Shortly before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the highest personality of any country , there was no security personnel far and wide .
With fun we were dragging photographs of gardens and verandah just fifty metres away from the door of his bungalow .
Can you think about the leader ' s house from anybody in India
It was also known that President sometimes crossing the roads on foot two blocks reach their office ahead .
Everything about the Maldives was overwhelming .
That is why I was eagerly waiting for the next day .
It was alleged that the day was about to be special .
In the morning a boat from the cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the base of Trace Maldives while roaming around the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near the male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing through the top .
The pictures that had seen .
But it was not supposed that the next day there would be an opportunity to ride .
We were about to go to Rangali Island one hundred and five kilometres away from the sea plane of Traus Maldives .
It was unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying at a height of about thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
With thrill and enthusiasm it was a breathing flight .
But on reaching the Conrad resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In a world , which had nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such thing that it was difficult to find out the beauty or luxury there .
Walking on Konrad can also be done on foot or also by battery driven car .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both sides of the bridge was amazing .
Now we could not even make ourselves simple with the nature of the surroundings , that we reached such a place , was unimaginable .
While descending several metres below the stairs we reached such a glass room which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
Crossing all around the glasses we could see humans while diving small - big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba of unique kinds .
The imagination of eating sitting on the decorated tables there was very thrilling in itself .
The fare of visiting this island from Male to Sea Plane and lunch underwater is only Rs . 47 thousand for a man .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to shed our passport in water .
But he knew it was not possible .
Heavily returned with this hope that sometimes , at some point , fate will definitely be brought here .
He had been planning to go out of Delhi for several days but it was not possible because of the busy work .
Since childhood there was a hobby of wildlife then thought why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after bikeing from Khardungla pass to Pegong lake in Ladakh .
On the morning of 27th December , we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the jealousy that had come out of the fog reflected our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Fog from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it seemed that it fell .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , which we had already booked .
There was no special programme on that day , despite being cold , we first went to roam on the edge of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Corbett Museum , which was near Dhangadi Gate 2 kms far very difficult .
From there we went down to roam Ramnagar .
It was late in the evening .
The lions roaming around in the jungle had come out from Delhi , then I would definitely see the lions in dreams all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night , I suddenly heard a tremendous storm , and the dogs that began to shout , did not stop for two hours .
So the suggestion of roaming Kaladhungi and Carbet Fall came first .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres away , while carbot falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladhungi , where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
On returning we got twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett was settled in this village .
On reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged siteing in the number one site Bijrani there .
On asking about number one told that there is more grassland and Tigers come on the same side to avoid cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees for four hours roaming .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tuskers of elephants whose long teeth were .
I took a lot of photography .
In the meanwhile the guide started tracking the tiger .
The guide told that around 150 tigers are there in the park , some of which have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was depressed by not seeing the Tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the Tiger ' s fitur was riding .
Then I remembered Haldwani ' s old friend .
I called him like that .
I told him that I had come to Carbet .
He asked whether the Tiger had seen or not .
Her words were shouted like arrows .
I said slowly , no .
There was no permission to carry a bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take the safari inside .
