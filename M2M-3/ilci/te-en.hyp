Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is another .
On one side of Kutch is Sindh and on the other side Gujarat , therefore there is a mixture of both in languages as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although there is a ' speaking language ' here , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutch then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is that Anjar city where many times earthquakes came and the whole city was destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal Toral is very charming .
If we came back through that path only then we had to take a holiday for a month and there schools were opened in Mumbai .
But what did we do  Now we travel on the train by telling the taxi for the fast buses of Gujarat .
Small train going from Bhuj to meter gauge reaches Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge reaches Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of Broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
Considering the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan the tourism system is going on in a very devastating condition these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing terror in Vaishvik Mandi and South Asia tourism has become very less .
According to the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased very much in these days .
In the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the survey the number of tourists of the country decreased by 9 . percent and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 AD a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated and in 2009 AD only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this there are two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 nationals and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with the tourist spot are very worried about this situation .
The founder of Rajputna Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik said that the tourism system has been completely influenced by the incidents of Vaishvik Mandi and terrorism .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not even developed the tourism system strong , based .
Due to this the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . percent in comparison to the last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan there is maximum among the French tourists .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy love Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent very well this year .
After 2002 AD this was the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan was decreasing .
With the point of view of tourism nothing new is happening .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , forests all are also old to enjoy the tourists .
In the area of tourism the words of working with the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism are said to be very important but in this direction nothing has been done .
Facilities of tourists coming to Rajasthan are also available very less .
At the same time along with foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in the present year the incidents of violence and noise have also taken the beauty of this state to the international level .
The Government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has become limited only to papers .
One example of the victory of the Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This branch provides the facility of accommodation , food , traffic , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are total 75 branches in this institution .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight tarea , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on Wheels and Royal Rajasthan Wheels but the situation of this institution is also lagging behind for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to increase to 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 this year .
The situation of hotels of this institution is such that in the last five years even forty percent rooms have not been filled in these hotels .
Along with hotels other departments of the organization also cause a lot of damage to it .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists are not attracting towards this train .
Despite less fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly during the Pushkar fair at present also the favour of the tourists has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 AD 398 foreign travellers had stayed in the tourist village built by this fair at the door of RTDC , while this year there are only 217 people reducing this number .
In the midst of all these there is no dearth in attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . city train .
This train continues to be beneficial .
Last year through this train RTDC has benefitted nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to this deficiency in the tourism sector of Rajasthan it has become natural to lose loss in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most dependent of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from soil .

Located towards the left hand in the middle of the snowy mountain peak the sight falls on the lean colored red color coming in the sky on the surfaces .
There is a lot of cold in the air .
Along with cold shivering in the weather one feels moisture as well .
By a sound that comes on putting legs sight is seen on the layers of wood .
The weather is quiet and because of being smooth before sunrise is not visible very well .
The vision remains on the red color of the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balkani .
The layers of the thin layer spread on the lying of the hand slide with light sound and the hand soon separates from the cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , Switzerland is the first experience of spending the night in this small village situated in the middle of these mountains covered with snow .
This is the third foreign resident of me in Swiss .
Before this spend a long time near Janiwa or around it .
Located on both the sides of the valleys of the thin Balkhati river most of the people are spread till a height of light rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which there are many small and big cities .
Contrary to the Ron river the national highway and the vehicles moving on it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and half an hour journey of two and a half hours in the car then along with Janiwa lake parallel and half Ron river the Geneva lake coming from eastern side near the city named Montro which is called Lake Lama in French .
This lake of 100 kms long and 10 kms wide is situated in the west of Geneva city .
From there the waterfall turned into a river and flows towards the west .
On the right side the waterfall flows brightly , the Alps mountain peaks touching the sky .
Crossing a beautiful small town named Luke we left this highway on the left side , we will come in the north to the hilly path .
On the third day because of the hilly plains being in the southern direction the sun is giving sun to all the corners .
In comparison to the valleys snow climate can not be considered less or less here .
As soon as it moves towards the height , the snow is increasing densely .
There is no cold in the air because of the calm and bright sun on both sides of the road despite being extremely snowy .
After deciding the journey of approximately 20 k . . on this curved mountainous road we reached a small village called Thel .
There are huge storied palaces made of wood with roofs of stone - sloping roofs .
In this three storied building the foundation stone made of cement concrete along with lodging of vehicles is part of controlling the necessary facilities like electricity , water , laundry .
Valai is famous for grapes in Switzerland .
This is the main center of wine drying .
In the total area of K . . only grapes are grown in 37  .
In the villages around the Rone Valley grapes give importance to the unique beauty there .
Walking on foot in the vineyard , roaming them , providing night rest in the villages there and showing the taste of alcohol by taking them to the liquor industry is a part of the tourism department here .
There is a very big museum of grape juice in a watch made in the 12th century in a small profession called Age which foreign tourists have to make an agrim booking .
Once again we go through that deserted jungle with Davagni .
The mind of the questions of children asking for three - four k . . has become even more unhappy .
Suddenly there is a dramatic and entertaining change in the scene of a turn .
Right straight , on the left side of the road , on the very deep valleys a beautiful group of houses is standing .
People are skiing in snow on the plains of plains from the edge of the village .
The dense forests of Deodar are spread till the Kond peak on the skiing slope .
There is a dense snow on all the four sides .
The rays of the sun on the houses are shining .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same peace is spread .
From the peaks of the mountains all around to the valleys the bright snow empire is .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big circular cycle situated in the middle of that profession .
The name of the business is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukarabad is approximately 1500 hundred .

In Darjeeling itself we told that Sikkim only taxis go so that checking is not done .
The journey is going on , there is another place , but the mountains are the same , the trees and plants , the wind of sounding sounds .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the light of blue blue light in the rainy season .
With the decision of the journey plan of Darjeeling it was decided to take the blankets of Karsiyang first .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens is full of dust forests .
Good tea is famous for production .
On moving towards Darjeeling from Siliguri in the beginning tea gardens welcome the people coming towards themselves looking for smiles .
From the middle of the tea gardens going on the road attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side dense slopes .
Here once the jungle used to see tea gardens .
There was greenery empire all around .
Once I was stunned to see these natural jungles or see the tea gardens poured by man .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful wilderness , the more beautiful is the tea gardens .
On going to the roads on the roads the creation looks marvellous .
We were walking through the curved curved and paths of Pamula .
The time was also spent .
Forest and tea gardens have not ended .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
On a hill from a distance houses - buildings etc . were seen in a very queue .
This is Karsiang .
Staying at one place here we prepared a plan to roam around a day .
That is why we took a vehicle and went to Karsiang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles .
To go up that is to reach the deer park one had to leave the vehicle very low .
Despite being spread above the beauty of Karsiyang the development of the tourist spot has not been popular .
However , the city is very good and very peaceful .
While the road was clear we enjoyed climbing the way between charming and dust trees to reach the deer park filled with jungles .
The other place is Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the British period lovers used to take life by jumping from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddinuma dome here which looks from the height a beautiful scene of estimation of the whole city .
In the tea gardens nearby women are tied up on their back and playing hands very fast and are mixed with tea leaves .
There is a museum outside Kasiang city , but on that day we could not go there because it was very important to roam the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in us , but it was very troubled by it , like this it was raining that how can we roam .
But the weather is very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around the sun only then .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
The Gangamaya flowing through some mountains moving a little down from here was seen .
Here amidst rocks the magnificence of waterfalls is spectacular .
In Rock Garden we saw that the waterfalls in the empire of rocks and rocks are decorated with the stones of the world in Gangamaya .
Both of these places are standing very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
After climbing up with the help of vehicle we saw smoke in Darjeeling .
All the mountains and towns of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of forefront .
The quantity of weather was very clean till now .
When we went towards the monastery , the group of clouds did not know where they came and clouds were blooming .
In the evening there was a plan to shopping on the Mall Road .
During the journey of Darjeeling the journey of the train illuminates like full moon .
From Darjeeling to Gum and from Dhum to Darjeeling the journey of tower train is a special attraction for the tourists .
There is a slight break in boating and garden in the Mirik lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar through this route , where handwritten sweater etc . are available in Nepali industry .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
Not only greenery of tea gardens but there are sounds of jungles and waterfalls .
The most famous tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are filled with jungle - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
If we came to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam around Darjeeling in the winter season , then the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here have tied their faces on their own .
My condition was a small journey very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , sometimes some important place , water ships or any city like a city full of rose or lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place I am talking about was made about about four and a half years ago , but with the construction of which this place came there he really saluted the forest .
Not only for the people going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Rambabu replied my words , yes , before that we did not even think that we could stay like this in the jungle .
Fifty percent of Sibbadi is the people of this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not get work in heritage hotels as well .
Rambab , the resident of Ajabgarh , had worked in Jaipur before this and today this great royal grandeur is in the Amman garden .
He himself used his words and deeds to be a new way .
The estimation of ' Ayya ' is Aman Bagh .
There no one will talk to you in English .
Aman Bagh is really a tourist place with peace and all the comfortable comforts .
That garden also has its own history and the most important thing is that you can also introduce you to the nearby areas there .
In the palaces of the emperor of Rajasthan how many people have roamed in Bhangarh of the past , why should you go away , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek , if the night is spent in this place .
After the construction of Aman Bagh the elders of the country and abroad came there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me there completely but I could not go .
This thing otherwise she had lost her way and reached Bhangarh .
This time suddenly I reached there for the invitation of our foreign kinsmen but it seemed as if those people who want to spend their holidays in less time had to go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where Alwar king used to make camps for hunting .
Its construction was done in twelve hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is witness of those days .
Full of mountains and in the shadow of sulphur trees the first shining of Aman Bagh will hypnotise you .
As you come in , you will welcome you in the same way by which you will feel that you look at the great peace here .
Together with building the head of Manikarn the aarti mantras are said to be alive .
We reached there in the evening and we felt to put a surrounding garden in that garden .
I was decorating the jokey given to us , immediately answered that it was very interesting for me .
All buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lining .
Yes , all new things are artistic . There is no surprise that Amanbagh has got the present prize as well .
The manager decided our program in the morning .
First of all walking along with Rambab and then jeep journey in Bhangarh .
While walking on a small road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sun rays were spread gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers are cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the crop of tobacco .
This light of rural life is a unique experience for zeki .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit for million dollars .
The method of Aman Bagh is also genetic jaggery and curd .
Then it was understood why tourists come here for so much expenses .
I have heard that tour packages are also being made to show travel life .
Is this true
There is no doubt and not one such happens in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is usually decided from four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this staying there , eating food etc are also included .
In such a way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there was no greater development and there was no special effect on time in the quantity of life of nature and people .
At the same time ancient tourist site etc . are also there .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to conducting a survey of traditional Kuzin .
In fact , with the goal of such journeys tourists have to show direct instruments and traditions in that area .
Although it feels a little difficult to think , but such a tour is really very interesting and one feels a different kind .
The journey of sufficient is enjoyable for us .
With this even with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can free your favorite book for a long time .
Yes , it is so important that we have heard of spending and staying in this journey for a long time .
This is the reason that for enjoying these some things must be kept in mind , especially sometimes some foreigners are watching you through a lot of tour .
Find a good middlemen before taking a ticket .
Students , seniors of the army , children etc . get receipt in it , both are also available for stone .
As soon as the ticket is less then it is better to apply a bus tour plan for the last minute that you should go before planning .
Instead of tour ticket know about the total tour rate .
This is cheap .
There are also some suggestions for the goods , therefore you should also know about the quantity and weight of the goods .
If this happens at some places then you will have to go to some stuff in terminals or pay more money .
At the same time in the tour company also get information about insurance or damaged diet .
Go with calorie on bags .
Because these are fit in the rock situated on the seat .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing the bus while traveling the goods will be yourself .
From wherever you go by bus reach there , one hour before time .
You should take special care of this matter in time .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will also have the opportunity to get a good seat .
While selecting the seat pay attention to your convenience also .
In the back seat there are many swimmings , but there is no suitable reading in the front seat .
If you have to go to urine again and again then take the last seat and do not like much interval then the seat beside the window will be good for you .
Now is an active thing .
If you are in the seat of putting hands on both the sides then sit on the last seat and keep your bag on the other .
If there are no people in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washing in the bus then keep in mind this thing while choosing the seat , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get information of very important things from them .
They ask everyone to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat because the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Whenever the bus stops then come back on time .
If you do not come from time to time , you can get your place for a new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After this if you stay in the fair then even then hotels can be found at a little less price but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then money in pocket will be reduced .
Sea cruise is very beneficial here .
In the first week of December Luke Cruise and Colombo started the only cruise of India from Kochi .
Louis Cruise got a lot of reputation in the business of European company and cruise hotels .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now reduced its service but it is believed that it starts returning from October .
In Louis Cruise ship Emvie Aquamerine you can go to Maldives for about 5850 rupees per person every night for three days cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than approximately 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then it is completely free for children of 15 years .
Otherwise .
Tea-tiffin , food are available at the fare of cruise only .
Every moment the Kalakshakshetra stays with them .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the calculations , programs available in Maldives according to your pocket - from seaplane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly if a seaplane comes in front of you then you will feel like a sportsman .
But this television of 12 - 15 seats is excellent in all ways to roam in Archipelego like Oterplane Maldives .
Walking like a speed bottle on water it does not know when it flys into the air .
On flying completely you will not feel like flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your sight will be seen below the window and in the blue water of different types of sites of Maldives the resort islands and Koral islands are covered with smoke .
Everything looks very good .
There are two seaplanes companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of these which has twenty seaplanes .
If you want you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or you can take the rent for spending the whole day in the sea line .
Although if you go from island to another then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey that you will never feel the feeling of finishing it .
The journey of sea line from 12 km to 183 kms is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovener shops of the capital of the Ahmadi market of Male .
One day before the Maldives President Mahmood Nashid of Salesman was listening very carefully to the confluence given in the World Environment Convention in Copenhagen .
In fact , I did not see any Indian listening to the speech of presidents or prime ministers so carefully .
But when there are questions of the existence of a new structure on this land then it is unparalleled for such seriousness .
Many people considered unemployed in the meeting of the water in the Maldives in October but if they go to Maldives then it feels as if the varieties of nature are drawing from us then the world will get down to the devastating condition .
There are many such significances in the beauty there .
The beauty of that small country will be as if it is mixed .
When our sight goes towards the road towards the water of the sea then it feels as if the people here are able to understand the value of these beauty at what level .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming in the depth of several metres below the lappost light is seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see some centimetres of water of sea or river from any city of India completely then you will consider you to be very fortunate .
Returning to Emvi Acamerine the evening spent in Male was roaming around in the jungle for two hours .
Coral Ref is the life here .
As far as possible in the stones situated on the tombs you will also get to see the glittering stones .
Just a few moments before hearing President Nashid 's rule we were standing outside his government residence center .
There is no belief that we were in front of the highest testimony building of another country and nobody was able to save for a long time .
We were taking photographs of Vasara and gardens situated at a distance of approximately fifty kilometres through the door of their building .
Can you think about any royal house in India
It was also known here that the president sometimes goes to his office ahead of two blocks crossing the road on foot .
Every time I am surprised about the Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
Devvani meaning that day some important incident will take place .
In the morning a ship from cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we roamed around in the runway and reached Maldives Base .
First evening when we reached near the cruise male we immediately reminded the seaplane moving above .
The number of photographs we saw .
But then it did not lose the next day there was a chance of traveling in it .
Through the sea line of Trace Maldives we had to go to Rangali Island hundred and five kilometres .
To see thousands of resorts and Koral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the sealine flying up to a height of approximately a thousand km is unforgettable .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous to climb by holding the breath with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konrad resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali Island it seemed as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , there is no relation with any country outside it .
The architecture is not like that where it is difficult to find out such beauty or rocks .
Walking on Konrada is also possible or also with battery-driven vehicles .
While moving from Jetty to the main island the view of the lifestyle of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge is unique .
Now in the nature of the surroundings we are unable to believe us naturally as well , we reached such a place , it was unforgettable .
With the help of the stairs we reached the glass room while moving into the sea water several metres below which was inside the water .
This room is usually a dining room .
On all the sides we can see all kinds of small fish , corals , snow climbing and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated chairs was very thrilling in us .
The fare of visiting this island from Male to Siplen is 47 thousand rupees per person for seeing it and for lunch under water .
We did n't feel like returning from there .
All of us were ready to throw our passports in water .
But you know , this is not so easy .
Besides this belief that whenever there is any chance then fortune will definitely be brought here .
For many days plans have been made to go out of Delhi but due to stress of work it is not possible to go anywhere .
Since childhood wildlife was favorite but I thought that this simple Jim Corbett would not go .
In 2006 after biking till Pegog lake situated in front of Khardugla in Laddakh this is another bike tour .
In the month of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the enthusiasm that came out of which the smoke had forgotten our speed .
In the journey between Hafood and Gajrola we are really tired .
From above the roads of smoke and in front of them .
Many times it seemed as if we had lost .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar right at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
Our resorts were in Dhakuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was a special program that when we were cold we first went to roam on the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went to the carbot museum , at a distance of 2 k . . from a lot of hard work we were near Dhangadi Gate .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar situated below .
It was the right evening to return .
On deciding from Delhi we went out to see the lion roaming around in the jungle , surely I had seen a lion in dreams all night .
In the middle of the night deep sleep suddenly I heard a very big sound and after that the dog began to stop for two hours .
The decision of roaming Kaladungi and carbot falls had come before contract .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , only then came on the carbot fall road .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett Sahib Museum , where some important things related to their real life have been kept .
The return was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort was waiting for us .
It has been told that they had provided the facility of singing in a Saint Bijara there .
On asking about number one it is said that there is a lot of Grassland and the tigers come towards that side to escape from cold at this time .
On reaching Bijrani he gave us a guide , who takes two hundred and fifty to roam for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many types of animals and deer there of various species .
Inside we saw two tusker elephants , which had big teeth .
I took photographs with courage .
In the middle the guide started trekking Tiger .
The guide said that around 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died now .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was disappointed with the absence of tigers .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the tiger had lost the earthquake .
Then I remembered my old friend of Haldani .
I called him Saradake .
I told him I came to carbot .
And he asked him whether the tiger had seen or not .
His words are like arrows to me .
I said slowly , no .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Someone gave us advice that you should take inner safari .
