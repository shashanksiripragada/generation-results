Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , other .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there are two mixtures in language as well .
It is called ' Kachhi ' .
Although there is ' speaking language ' here , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kachhi then you have to write in Gujarati script itself .
There is that Anjar city near Bhush where several times earthquakes came and the whole city got destroyed .
The tomb of Jaisal-Toral is near Anjar .
The story of Jaisal - Tharal is very interesting .
If we return from that path through which we came back then we had to take the holidays again after a month and schools were opened in Mumbai there .
But what to do  Now we have traveled by train by telling Tata for fast buses of Gujarat .
Small train going from Bhuj to Meter George reaches Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge reaches Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system considered to be the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan is spending in a very humiliating condition these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing extremism in Vaishvik Mandi and South Asia the tourism system has become very low .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased very much in these days .
In the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has come down by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the statistics 9 . 87 percent of the number of tourism of the country and 27 . 36 percent decrease in the number of foreign tourists has come down .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated in the year 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this there are two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 indigenous and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
The founder of Rajputana Hollyday Makers Sanjay Kaushik has said that due to the incident of Vaishvik Mandi and extremists the tourism system has completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not developed the tourism system here as a strong and baseful .
Because of this the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also come down by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan France is the highest among the tourists .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has spent a very good year .
After 2002 AD this was the first issue of reduction in the number of tourists of Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism nothing will happen new .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , jungles all are also such ancient to enjoy the tourists .
In the tourism sector all the governments say the words of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism are important but nothing has been done in this direction .
Facilities of travellers coming to Rajasthan are also available very less .
At the same time in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists the incidents of violence and hunting have also taken the beauty of this state to the international level .
The Rajasthan government has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has just been limited to papers .
One example of the victory of Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This branch provides the facility of residence , food , traffic , boating etc to the tourists .
There are 75 branches in this institute .
Among these 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight estateria , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels are behind but this institute has also remained behind for many years .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is estimated to increase to 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of hotels in this institute is such that in the last five years forty percent rooms have not even been filled in these hotels .
Along with hotels other departments of the institute are also very harmful to it .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists are not able to attract towards this train .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract the tourists .
In this way during the Pushkar Fair the fondness of the tourists has also been seen to be less .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair was built by RTDC in the tourist village where 398 foreign travellers stayed , this year this number was reduced to only 217 .
In the middle of all this the pleasant thing of RTDC is that there is no dearth in attracting tourists towards the Palace on Wheels i . . city train .
This train is continuously benefitting .
Last year RTDC had a profit of Rs . 9 . crore through this train .
Due to this deficiency occurring in the tourism sector of Rajasthan it has become natural to see the loss in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If man wants to do something in his mind then he can make gold from soil .

There is very good cold in the air .
Along with shivering cold in the weather one feels moisture as well .
The wooden layer is seen on a sound occurring on the feet .
Because the weather is calm and foolish before sunrise is not visible very well .
The vision remains on the red color situated in the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balkani .
The thin layers spread as soon as the hand falls with a slight voice and the hands get separated immediately due to cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village situated in the middle of these mountains covered with snow .
This is my third foreign country in Swiss .
Before this we spent a long time in Janiwa or nearby .
Most of the people situated in the valleys on both sides of the thin Balkhati river are spread to a great height of light rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which there are many small and big cities .
Approximately the national highway and vehicles moving on it are clearly visible on the banks of the Ron river .
On crossing half an hour 's journey of 300 kms away and two and a half hours in the car the Geneva lake coming from the east along with the waterfall of Janiva and half Ron river , Montro near the city , which is called Lake Lama in French , merges in it .
Geneva city is situated in the west of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the waterfall again turns into a river and flows towards the west .
On the right side are the peaks of Alps mountain touching the sky flowing brightly .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left this highway on the left side , we will come to the mountainous path on the north side .
Because of the mountainous plains being in the southern direction the sun is giving sunlight to all the corners in the morning .
In comparison to the valleys the ice climate can not be said to be less here .
As the snow moves towards the height , the snow is increasing deeply .
While on both sides of the road there is a lot of snow covered but due to the peaceful and shining sun there is no coolness in the air .
We reached a small village called Thel after deciding the journey of about 20 kms on these slopy mountainous roads for half an hour .
There are palaces of big storeys built completely with roofs of stones and slopes .
In this three storied building along with lodging of vehicles in the foundation stone made of cement concrete there are parts of regulating necessary facilities like electricity , water , laundry .

Age is a very big museum of grapes juice in a tiny business made in 12th century to see which foreign tourists have to get English booking done .
Once again we go through that jungle ashamed of Dawagni .
The mind became even more happy with the questions of the children asking for three-four k . . long .
Suddenly the dramatic and pleasant changes come from a turning scene .
Right straight , on the left side of the road on the very deep valleys a crowd of beautiful houses is established .
People are skiing in snow in the fields of the plains from the edge of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread till the Konda peak on the skiing slip .
There is dense snow all around .
The rays of the sun are shining on the houses of swimming .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also the same peace is spread .
All around there is a bright snow empire from mountain peaks to valleys .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that profession .
The name of profession is Lukarabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Lukarabad is about 1500 .

It is said in Darjeeling that only Sikkim taxis go so that checking does not take place .
The journey is taking place , the place is different , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants , the sounding air .
It makes the whole body shivering .
This is the light of slight blue color in the rainy season .
As soon as the journey plan of Darjeeling was decided to take the blankets of carsing first .
Karsing is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , smoke is full of jungles .
Good tea is famous for production .
If we go towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then in the beginning tea gardens are welcomed to those who come towards themselves while smiling .
Going on the road from the middle of tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side the green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side the dense valley .
Here once the jungle was seen once in tea gardens .
There was a green empire all around .
Once I am afraid that I should see this natural jungle or see the tea gardens laid by man .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful it is , the more beautiful tea gardens .
When we look at the roads on the way then the creation looks unique .
We were walking by crooks going to snakes and passing time on the way .
Time is also passing .
Wildlife and tea gardens are not over .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From a distance on a hill houses , buildings etc . were seen in a very queue .
This is Karsiyang .
Staying at one place here we made a plan to roam all day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we left for the journey of Karsiyang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Go up i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiyang is spread till now and has not been developed and famous as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and very peaceful .
While the road was busy , to reach the deer park filled with jungles the joy of climbing the road between charming and dump trees was giving us courage .
The other place is Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
It is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the British times lovers used to take away their lives from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
Here is a dome of Sidiniuma which looks like a beautiful view of estimating the entire city from a height .
In the tea gardens nearby women are engaged in sneezing tea leaves while playing hands very fast by tying shoes on the back .
There is a museum outside Kasang city , but that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to tour the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience in us , but it was very difficult for us to roam like this when rains are falling .
But the weather is very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed while enjoying the sunlight .
This garden is a beautiful place worth seeing with rocks , waterfalls and jungle flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
Moving a little down from here we saw the Ganges flowing on some mountains .
Here amidst the rocks the magic of the waterfalls swallows on seeing .
In the Rock Garden we saw that in the empire of stones and stones the waterfalls of Gangamaya are decorated with stones in the Maa world .
Both of these places are settled very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
We saw smoke in Darjeeling climbing up with the help of a vehicle .
From here all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of fortnight .
The quantity of weather was very neutral till now .
When we moved towards the Monastery , the crowd of clouds did not know where they came and the clouds burst .
In the evening there was a plan of shopping on the mall road .
In the journey of Darjeeling , the journey of the typical train illuminates the whole moon .
Train journey from Darjeeling to Gum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here there is a boating in Mirik lake and a slight break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this route , where in Nepali industry sweaters etc . are available .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
Not only the greenery of tea gardens but the sound of jungles and waterfalls is also there .
The most popular tourist spots of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are filled with jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Calcutta to roam Darjeeling in the winter season , but tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling have bound their faces .
My state was a small journey very pleasant and thrilling .
This journey is not of foreign countries but not outside Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a favorite thing in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts towards itself , sometimes some major place , water ships or any city like a city full of train or pink or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people are brought towards themselves .
The place which I am talking about was made only four and a half years ago , but with which construction this place came here he really enjoyed the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears our guide Rambaba is shouting my words , yes , before that we did not even think that we could stay in the jungle .
This place is fifty percent of the people .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not even get work in heritage hotels .
Rambaba , a resident of Ajabgarh , used to work in Jaipur before this and today this magnificent royal grandeur was in the Amman Garden .
He himself used to make his words and deeds a new way .
The estimation of Aya ' Amman Bagh .
There nobody speaks to you with English .
Amman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable tourist place .
This garden also has a history in itself and the most important thing is that it will also introduce you to the nearby areas .
How many people who spend holidays in the palaces of the emperors of Rajasthan have roamed in Bhanggarh of the landscape , why should they go far away , even in the people of Jaipur , Kuchek may have spent night in this place .
After the construction of Amman Bagh big people of the country and abroad came there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me completely there but I could not go .
The other thing is that she had reached Bhanggarh on its own leaving the way .
This time suddenly I reached there for the invitation of our foreign kinsmen but it felt that those people who want to spend their holidays in less time definitely wanted to go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left in those seven gardens where Alwar king used to make camps for hunting .
Its construction was done in fifteen hundred twenty .
Its ancient wall is witness to those days .
The first glittering of Amman Bagh filled with mountains and in the shadow of sulphur trees will hypnotise you .
As you come inside you will be welcomed by which you will feel that pay attention to the great peace here .
Together with building on the head of the manifestation aarti mantras are kept alive .
We reached there in the evening and we felt to put one surrounding in that garden .
We were hosting the hosting jokey , immediately gave me peace , it became very interesting to me .
All the buildings and forts are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Yes , on all the new news , artistic , there is no wonder that Ammanbagh has also got the present prize .
We decided our programs in the morning .
First of all walking with Rambaba and then jeep journey in Bhanugarh .
While walking on a small road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the rays of sun gradually spread .
We saw the dry lake in which farmers are cultivating .
This year it did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco crops .
The wish of eki is that this light of rural life is a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhanugarh by jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit of millions dollars .
The method of Amanbagh is also hereditary and by feeding jaggery and curd we were supposed to be ridiculed .
Then it was understood why tourists would come here so much expensively .
I heard that even to show the triple life tour packages would also be put .
Is this true
There is no doubt and this is not one but happens in many states and tourists also show more interest in it .
This tour is normally decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists take to different places .
Staying there , eating etc . are also included in it .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where a lot of development has not taken place and there is no major effect on the quantity of life of nature and people there .
Along with this there are also ancient tourist sites etc .
Besides this , the surveillance of traditional cousin is also done .
Indeed , such a journey aimed at showing the dressing methods and traditions of that place directly to the tourists .
Though it feels a little difficult to think here , but such tours are really very interesting and a different kind of experience .
The journey of Chalu is enjoyable for us .
With this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can let your favorite book free for a long time .
Yes , here it is so important that we have the desire to stay optimistic in this journey with expensive and long time .
This is the reason that for enjoying these some things must be kept in mind , especially when some foreign destination is being seen with you through a tour .
Find a good middleman before taking a ticket .
Students , seniors of the army , children etc . get relief from them , both are also available for hijacking .
As soon as the ticket is taken less then it is better to put a bus tour plan for the last minute to be done before planning .
Instead of a tower ticket know about the whole tour rate .
It becomes cheap .
There are some suggestions for goods also , therefore you should also know about the quantity of materials and weight .
If this happens somewhere then you will have to leave some of your goods in the terminals or pay more money .
At the same time in the tour company also get information about insurance or damage .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they get fit in the rock on the seat .
Keep in mind this also that while changing the bus during the journey the responsibilities of the goods will be yourself .
Where to go by bus reach there , one hour before time .
At the time of busyness you take special care of this matter .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will also have the chance of getting a good seat .
While selecting the seat also take care of your convenience .
There is a lot of buffaloes in the back seat , but it is not suitable to read in the front seat .
If you have to go to urine again and again then take the last seat , and do not like much interval , the seat on the side of the window will be very good for you .
Now it is an active thing .
If you are in a seat to put your hands on both sides then sit on the last seat beforehand and keep your bag on the other .
If there are not many people in the bus then planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washing in the bus then keep in mind that while selecting the seat , because after some time there is difficulty in sitting there .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
It is said that while cleaning the bus everyone has to go out .
During this time do not keep your goods on the seat because if they go then the busmen do not take responsibility for it .
Whenever the bus stops then come back on time .
If you do not come on time , your place can be available to any new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

After this if you stay in the fair then even then hotels can be obtained at least but to enjoy the real beauty of the Maldives go to any island nearby then the money in the pocket reduces .
Cruise proves to be very useful here .
Louis cruise started from Kochi in the week before December and only one cruise of India for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise has received a lot of reputation in the business of European companies and cruise hotels .
Although due to some difficulties the Louis cruise has now reduced its services but it is believed that it will start again from October .
You can go to Maldives on a cruise of about 5850 rupees per person every night for three days in a cruise of about 5850 rupees .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then children of 15 years of age are completely free .
Otherwise .
Tea-tiffin , food are available at the rent of cruise .
Every moment the timelines are with them .
Reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the timelines available in the Maldives according to the number of your pockets - from seaplane ride to underwater lunch .
If you stop roaming in big airplanes suddenly after coming in front of you a seaplane then you will feel like a sportsman .
But this twelve - 15 seats of Ooty Plane is the best for touring in archipelago like Maldives .
While running like a speed boat on water it does not know when it flys in the air .
When you fly completely you will not feel like flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your vision will be seen below the window that in various types of sites of Maldives the resort islands and coral islands are covered with smoke in blue water .
Everything looks very well .
There are two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trass Maldives is one of them , with which there are twenty sea planes .
If you want you can roam around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in a flight for an hour or you can hire the entire seaplane for spending the whole day .
If you go from the island to another island then the journey of sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between various islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never feel like finishing .
Seafline travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . in Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and sovenire shops of the capital of Ahmadi Bazar of Male .
Selsman Lanta is listening to the speech given by the President of the Maldives Mahmad Nashid in Copenhagen a day ago in the World Environment Conference .
Actually I have not seen any Indian listening to the speech of the Presidents or Prime Ministers so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of a new creation on this land , it is unparalleled for such a seriousness .
Many people consider it unemployed in the meeting of the water in the Maldives in October but if we go to Maldives then it feels that if the nature evils are drawn from us then the world gets down so depressed .
There are some such significances in the beauty there .
In that small country it is as if the beauty is incomplete .
When we return towards the jetty to go back from that market tour to our cruise then when we look towards the water of the sea moving towards the road then it feels that the people here can understand the value of this beauty to what level .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming in several metres deep below the lappost light is seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see a few centimetres of water of sea or river from any city of India completely then you will consider yourself very fortunate .
Returning to Emvi Acamerin we were roaming in the jungle at two o'clock in the evening spent in Male .
Coral Reef is a life here .
As far as possible you will also get a glimpse of stones on the tombs .
A few moments before listening to President Nasheed 's speech we were standing outside his government residence .
There is no belief that we were in front of the high regime of another country and for some time no defence guard was there .
We were taking photographs of Vasara and gardens situated at a distance of about fifty kilometres while entering through the gate of their building .
Can you imagine this about anybody 's house in India
It is also known here that the President sometimes goes to his office ahead of two blocks crossing the road on foot .
Every time we were surprised about the Maldives .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
Devawani means that on that day some important incident will take place .
In the morning itself a ship from cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we reached the Maldives base roaming around in the runway .
Next evening when the cruise reached near Male then we immediately remembered the seaplane moving above .
How many photographs were they .
But then we could not lose the next day there was a chance of traveling in it .
Trass had to go to Rangali island by the sealine of Maldives for an hundred five kilometres .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of resorts and coral islands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from a flying sealine till a height of about a thousand kms .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is adventurous to fly up by holding the breath with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotels in Rangali Island we felt that we had reached some other world .
In such a world , there is no relation with any country outside it .
Wasta is not like this as well where it is difficult to get out such beauty or luxury .
Tour on Konarad is also possible on foot or by battery riding vehicles .
On both the sides of the bridge going from Jetti to main island the view of the lifestyle of the tribes is unique .
Now we are not able to believe us naturally in the nature nearby , we have reached such a place , which is unimaginable .
With the help of stairs while entering the sea water several metres we reached the room with glass which was inside the water .
That room is normally a dining room .
We can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snow crawling and scuba diving on all the sides of the glass .
The imagination of eating sitting on the chairs decorated there is very thrilling in us .
The fare of visiting this island in the syplen of Male is 47 thousand rupees per person for seeing it and underwater ranch .
We did not feel like returning from there .
We were also ready to break our passports in water .
But we know that this is not that easy .
With this unforgettable belief , then whenever there is any chance , fortunately brings it here .
I have been planning to go out of Delhi for several days but it is not possible to go anywhere due to stress of work .
Since childhood we liked wildlife but I thought that we would not go to this serpent Jim Corbett .
In 2006 after biking till Pegog lake situated ahead of Khardugala near Laddakh this is another bike tour .
In the month of 27 December we went out of Delhi for Jim Corbett , but the smoke that excitement came out of which smoke displayed our speed .
The journey between Hafood to Gajrola is really tired .
The roads from above are smokey and unprecedented .
Many times we felt that we were still dead .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resorts were in Dhukuli near the park , whose booking was done beforehand .
On that day there was a major program that we were cold , but first we went to roam on the shore .
After spending two - three hours we went out to the Corbett Museum , at a distance of 2 k . . from Dhangadi Gate .
From there we went to roam the Ramnagar situated below .
The best time to return is the evening .
We got out of Delhi to decide that while roaming around the jungle I had seen a lion all night in a dream .
I suddenly heard a very big voice in the middle of a deep sleep at night and after that the dog did n't ask for two hours starting .
Before hesitation the decision of touring Kaladungi and Carbot Fall was taken .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , only when the carbot fall came on the way .
Kaladungi Jim Corbett Sahib museum , where some important things related to their real life are kept .
After returning we were twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort is waiting for us .
It has been told that they have provided a seating facility in one site Bijrani there .
Asked about one number , it is said that there is a lot of Grassland and Tigers come to that side to protect from cold during this time .
On reaching Bijrani a guide gave us a guide , he takes two hundred and fifty to roam for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two square elephants , which had big teeth .
I boldly took photographs .
In the meanwhile the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide said that around 150 tigers in the park , some of which are now dead .
At many places we also saw the signs of their claws , but I was despaired because of the absence of the tigers .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain there was a storm of tiger .
That is why I remembered my old friend of Haldani .
I called him Saradake .
I told him that I came to Corbot .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
His words are like an arrow for me .
I said slowly , no .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a safari inside .
