Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch there is a mixture of both Sind and Gujarat as well .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although it is ' speaking ' , it does not have its own script .
If you want to write Kutchi then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Anjar is a city near Bhuj where earthquakes have occurred many times and the whole city has collapsed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Tural .
The matter of Jaisal - Tural is very entertaining .
If you come to Maghari by the same road as we had to come then you will have to take a complete one month 's holiday and on the other hand school will start in Mumbai .
So what to do , now let us travel by train by Ramram and Ramram by fast trains of Gujarat .
The small train of meter gauge will reach Rajkot from Bhuj .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai from Ahmedabad .
The tourism industry considered the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is going through a bad situation these days .
Because of global slowdown and the danger of increasing terrorism in South Asia tourism business has become serious .
With the point of view of tourism in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country special deficiency has been recorded in these days .
According to the figures announced by the Rajasthan government in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent compared to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 87 percent in the number of native tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of 2 crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 nationals and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included while in 2009 a total of 2 crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 nationals and ten lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People related to tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Rajputan Holiday Makers , says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have had a bad effect on tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop a strong foundation of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent last year .
21 percent of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the tourists of France are more .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism the last few years have been good for Rajasthan .
This is the first time since 2002 when the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
With the point of view of tourism nothing like this is happening .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , palaces , forts , brown forests all are old to see the tourists .
In the tourism sector all the governments do big things about rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing is being done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get facilities very less .
Together with this , the incidents of bursting and shadowing on foreign women tourists have stained this state internationally .
Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in this state a long time ago but it was limited to papers only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government regarding tourism is Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
With the aim of increasing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the basic form of tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This institute provides the facility of residential , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 motals , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one communication factor and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on wheels but for some years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
In 2008 - 09 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is likely to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this corporation is this that even forty percent of its hotels have not been filled in the last five years .
Along with hotels other parts of the institute are also harming it .
Among these the main are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not get an attraction in this train .
Even after reducing the fare it was not able to attract the tourists .
Likewise in the present year there has been an eagerness among the tourists about Pushkar Fair .
The tourist village built by RTDC in this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed , this year there has been a reduction in this number which is 217 .
The most satisfactory thing on behalf of this RTDC was that there was no dearth in the attraction of the tourists for the Palace on Wheels i . . royal fire train .
This fire train is proving to be beneficial .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . crore from this train .
It is natural to have an atmosphere of concern in the tourism sector due to this slowness coming in the tourism sector of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If the person wants to do something in his mind then he can remove gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has really shown this by settling modern city Ambo Valley in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
The dreams that he had dreamt are glittering in his eyes by seeing them progressing day by day .
His joy was seen even during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in building its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread over 10 , 000 acres there are only 9  of the ground hotels , houses and other facilities .
91 percent of the land trees , ponds , ponds , ponds , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many industrialists came forward to make their homes in this city built for only crores of husbands and today around 800 families live in this city .
Initially industrialists and rich people bought their Asians here in the form of Holiday Home but now they have made their homes and they also go to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambay Valley itself is Korigarh Fort which enhances the beauty of this complex .
The ruins of Leekawali in western Siang district are very important .
Remains of a large temple have been found while excavating .
On the pillars of stones of this temple carving work of the statues of lotus and goddesses is found which is mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very part .
At this place a descent idol of Durga Devi is found .
Behind the naming of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devalpani are still in the glorious tales of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamreshwari Devi found in this ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of Tameshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess had a far-flung recognition in the north-east mountain .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
Here the sacrifice of humans was also given which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak Nagar which are located in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the popular gallantry here this place is ancient Vidarbha , where once the king used to rule Bhishmak .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Degru , Mishmi etc . tribes guide the travellers here .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far and wide come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also historically important .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roeing are still telling their story .
The ruins of bathing ghats , pucca stairs and being surrounded by pucca ponds all around the other ponds and the ruins of wide - narrow roads are still singing the silence of our ancient magnificent valor .
We reach ero in four hours through jeep from North Lakhimpur the city of Upper Assam .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where people of the parents live .
Before becoming a jeep road it takes several days to reach here .
On reaching here the views of high deodar trees , beautiful premarose , wallets , wild currents , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the visitors .
There is a lot of production of apples and potatoes here .
At a height of approximately 1524 metres is a valley spread till 26 kilometres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of its people .
With its untiring hard work the parents have made it their heaven .
The farming of rice was very much here .
This place is ' rice store ' .
Ten miles long this plateau is a living example of their hard work and skill in farming .
The necessity of irrigation of black rivers is fulfilled .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the light redness emerging from the sky on the ground in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges of the left hand .
There is a good cold in the air .
Along with the cold touching in the environment one also feels wetness .
With the sound of waste - waste below the feet the sight of the layer of leaves laid on the wooden floor is seen .
There is softness in the environment and because of the sunrise the sunrise the sunlight was spread much was not visible .
The vision remains blooming on the redness of the east .
The mind to sit down in the balcony was to sit .
As soon as the hand is touched the layer of snow gets stuck with light sound and hands get shocked in the moment of feeling cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village settled amidst these mountains buried with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third journey in Swiss .
Before this a long time was spent in Geneba or around it .
On either side of the Balkhati river the dense settlement situated in the valley is spread on a very high slope .
This is the main river of Switzerland -LRB- Rhone -RRB- valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The highways parallel to the Ron river and the vehicles running on them are clearly visible .
The journey of 300 kms away and Karni two and a half hours is found in the middle -LRB- Geneva lake -RRB- near the city named Montreux which is called Lock Lemon -LRB- Lock Lemon -RRB- .
Geneva city is situated at the western end of this lake 100 kms long and 10 kms wide .
From there the lake again becomes a river and moves ahead in the west .
Crossing the lake on the right side are Dhawal , skyscraping Alps mountain ranges .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left this highway and came on the northern hilly road .
Because of the slope of the mountain being southward the sun of the evening gives a lot of salvation to all the eyelids .
The quantity of snow is less here than the valley - almost not along .
As we move ahead towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
There is no special cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun even though the snow is frozen on both the sides of the road .
On this rotating hill juice we reached a small village named Thel in about 20 kms journey in half an hour .
Chalet - There are large multi-storey bungalows made of wood , full of roofs .
There are rooms for controlling necessary services like electricity , water , landry along with parking of cars in the basement made of cement concrete of this three storied bungalow .
Valai is famous for grapes farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making wine wine .
The cultivation of grapes is done on 37  of the whole of Cantonment .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley gardens of grapes provide a unique dimension to its beauty .
Take a lake of grapes gardens , roaming around them , getting rest at night in the villages there and taking the grapes to the wine testing are an integral part of the tourism business here .
In a small town named Aigle in a small fort built in the 12th century there is a very big museum of wine made of grapes to see which foreign tourists have to register .
Once again we go through the same jungle having ashes from Dawanal .
Till three - four k . . on the road the mind becomes even more sad by the questions of the children .
Suddenly on a turn the dramatic and charming change comes in the scene .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the upper slope of the deep valley a beautiful hut of houses is located .
People are skiing in snow on the flat slopes situated in the upper part of the village .
From the slope to the top of the mountain the dense forest of Deodar is spread .
Deep snow has fallen all around .
The roofs of the houses of the town are shining because of the direct rays of sun falling .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same peace is spread here as well .
All around is the empire of Dhawal snow from the peak of the mountain to the valley .
Within the next five minutes you reach a big round cycle in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Lukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The estimation of the number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 Sadnika and Shale 1500 hotels , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 hotels for staying here .
In Luckerabad 65 sources of hot water have been found till now .
40 lakh litres -LRB- everyday -RRB- of water coming out of it is transported to thermal pools around 30 big pools built at places in the whole town , some bridges are inside the five star hotel and others are according to the economic level of people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels extreme heat .
A large layer of snow is shining on the roofs of the houses in the dry sunlight .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the places conserved in the form of national importance heritage in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that only taxis of Sikkim can go to Sikkim because of which checking is not done .
Travelling is going on , the region is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the shining wind is the same .
It is the wetness that makes tremors all over the body .
In the season of monsoon the fickat is the best .
As soon as the plan for the journey of Darjeeling was fixed the first time it was decided to take a glimpse of Karsiang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dump jungles .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
If we move ahead towards Darjeeling from Siliguri then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome the people coming to us by laughing .
For the first time going through the road going through tea gardens charms the heart .
On the one hand green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes the jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was a empire of greenery all around .
Once I got disturbed to see these natural jungles that see the tea plants planted by humans .
Both were attracting themselves .
The beautiful jungle was as beautiful as the tea garden spread far and wide .
If the vision of the roads falls on the way then the world looks magnificent .
The curved and circular road like a snake walk was moving forward .
Time was also going on .
If it was not over then it was a jungle and tea garden .
Sometimes small settlements were visible .
From far off places a hilly house - house etc . was seen very dense .
It was karsiang .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
This is why take a car and go out for the picnic of Karsiang .
First of all deer park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles all around .
The climb is above i . . to reach Deer Park the train had to leave very low .
Despite being filled with the beauty of Karsiang now it has not been developed and famous as a tourist spot .
While the city is very good and clean and beautiful .
Despite the road being deserted the joy of climbing the road through the greed and dhoopy trees of reaching the deer park surrounded by forests was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a point located at a height .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the British times lovers used to give life by swimming from here .
At present there is a park and hotel here .
There is a stair like dome here from the height of which a beautiful view is prepared after observing the whole city .
In the tea gardens around the women were busy in breaking tea leaves running their hands with a very fast speed by putting a hat on the back .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsyang but that day we could not go there because it seemed more necessary to roam around in the cruel environment of tea gardens .
The next day it is decided to roam Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but it was a big concern that if such rains continue to happen then how will we roam around
But the coincidence was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed enjoying the dry sunlight .
This park is a very attractive place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The road to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
Going a little more down from here we got the Ganga Maa surrounded by mountains .
The beauty of the waterfalls situated in the rocks here is worth seeing .
In Rock Garden we found that the waterfalls in the empire of stones and stones are very beautiful while the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is engraved with stones .
Both of these places are sitting very below the mountains of Darjeeling .
On getting up with the help of the car we saw Batasia hidden in Darjeeling .
From here on the basis of telescope the whole mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen .
The wave of the weather was clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery we did not know where the cloud came and started sparkling .
In the evening plan was made to roam on the mall road and to shop .
During the tour of Darjeeling toys enhance the glitter in the journey of fire .
The journey from Darjeeling to Dhum and Dhum to Darjeeling is a special attraction for the tourists .
Here boating in Mirik lakes and luxury in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar by this very route , where sweaters etc . used by Nepalese artisans are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its form - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but there is abundance of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong is - Laga and Lolegaon , which is full of jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come from Kolkata to Darjeeling to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of cold but here we kept me bound by tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling .
My present small journey was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign countries nor of Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts itself , sometimes some special place , water ships or any royal train train or any city like pink city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place which I am going to do is ready only about four and a half years ago , but the preparations with which this place has come there really did the welfare of the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
In my ears my guide turns the words of Ram Babu Meena . Before this we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle .
50 percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work even in the heritage hotel .
Ram Babu resident of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur before and now in the Aman Bagh of this unique royal style .
He brought his speeches in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the estimation of Aman Garden .
There nobody speaks to you with English language .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable picnic spot .
That garden also has its history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces its introduction to the surrounding region .
How many of the people who spend holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have traveled to Bhangarh in the past  How far did they go , some of the residents of Jaipur may have spent nights in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi had spoken me with heart there but I could not go .
It is different that he had reached Bhangarh on his own way .
This time suddenly when I reached there for my foreign guests then it felt that if people want to spend a good holiday in less time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left out of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in twenty fourteen hundred .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Garden surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
As you come inside the way in which you are welcomed , it feels that attention has been given to divine peace here .
Along with building Mauli in Mangata the mantra of Mangalachar is pronounced alive .
We had reached after evening and we decided to kill that garden a round .
My guest Jackie , who is a decorator , easily said , ' This is attractive ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . Nothing wondered that Aman Bagh has also got the award at present .
The administrator fixed our program for the morning .
First roamed on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the rays of the sun were spread gradually .
We saw dry lake in which farmers were cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
For jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Just in the morning I saw a tourist of the Halland sitting in mind .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The method of redemption of Aman Bagh was also traditional , giving us jaggery and curd to eat , they gave us relief .
Now it was noticed that why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are kept to see the life of the tribe .
Is it right
Undoubtedly and this happens not one but in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
In such a way an attempt is made to find such places where there has not been much development and there has no special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
Where old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid on doing all the traditional cuisine .
In fact , the purpose of such a tour was to make the tourists familiar with the way of living and tradition of that place .
Although this idea looks slightly difficult , but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
By this despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this in this journey you can give more time without obstructing your favorite book .
Yes , it is sure that along with giving a lot of time in less expensive and comfortable time these tours definitely expect you to be patient .
This is the reason that for enjoying these it is necessary to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching some foreign destination bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking the ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children etc . get licence on them , while for two people also there is arrangement of licence .
By the way , buying advance tickets is cheap , therefore at the last moment it is better to plan bus tours a little faster .
Get information about round trip instead of tower ticket .
They fall cheaper .
The rules regarding the baggage are specially strict , therefore think about the size and weight of the luggage .
Never do this happen that you will have to leave some of your luggage on the terminal or you will have to pay more fees .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or loss compensation from the tour company .
Carry on bags are right , let us take .
Because they sit together in the rack above these seats .
Keep in mind this thing also that while changing bus during tour the responsibility of goods is your own .
From where you want to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season you pay special attention to this thing .
Actually , the sooner you reach , the better option of seat will be with you .
Keep in mind whether it is pleasant while choosing the seat or not .
If you sit more on the back seat , then there is no conformity to read on the next seats .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously then take the seat of the corner and if you do not like much obstacles then the window seat will be good for you .
Now it is a square thing .
If you are both in the desire to force , then first sit on the seat of the corner and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there was no crowd in the bus , then the plan would be successful .
If there is a facility of washroom in the bus , then while selecting the seat also keep in mind this thing , because after some time it becomes difficult to sit there .
Identify the bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the seat , because they do not take responsibility for it after losing .
Wherever the bus stops , return on time .
If you do not come on time then you can get your place to another person and you will have to wait for bus .

The Ginger Hotel situated in the capital of Goa , Panaji makes this journey of western shore excellent .
Ginger hotel situated here is an excellent option to spend comfortable days enjoying cycling , River cruise , cold sea winds and world famous Goan items on the roads of Goa .
If seen today 's date then the fare of returning to the cheapest person from Delhi for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Mala even then you can get hotels at a little hire but to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives goes to any island nearby then the pocket will become small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Louis Cruise started India 's only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is extremely famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Louis cruise has now postponed its service , but there is a possibility of its resumption from October .
On the Lui Cruise ship M . . Aquarein you can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person every night .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then free of cost for the child under the age of 15 years .
What else do you want .
Tea - breakfast , food are included in the rent of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainment , activity available in Maldives according to your pocket from C plane ride to underwater lunch .
If you suddenly stand in front of you while flying in big airplanes then you will feel like a game .
But this twelve - 15 seat Ooty aircraft is excellent unquestionably for roaming the Maldives Sarkhan Island .
They do not even understand that while running like a speed boat from the surface of water they ever fly in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of normal aircraft .
Our sight constantly keeps on roaming below the window keeping in mind the blue water , resort islands and islands of different spectacles of Maldives .
How clean the whole looks .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies where there are 20 aircraft .
If you want you can travel aeroplane for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- every hour -RRB- or the whole aircraft can be rented in your possession throughout the day -LRB- only a pocket full -RRB- .
If we go to a different island than Male Island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the only way to travel on various islands .
And this is such a journey that we do not want to finish .
The journey of sea planes from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilewaru in the north -RRB- takes place on the Maldives island .
We were in the biggest ancient and sovenire shops of the capital in the Ahmedabad market of Male .
All the vendors were listening carefully to the speeches given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nasid at the World Climate Convention in Copenhagen a day ago .
I have not seen any Indian listening to the President or the Prime Minister's speech so carefully.
But when there was a question of the existence of a supernatural object on this planet then such a seriousness was natural .
Many people may have understood the meeting taken inside the water by the cabinet of the Maldives in October but on going to Maldives it feels that if it is shaken by the wrath of nature then the world will become a valley .
There is something special in the beauty there .
There is no such beauty in that small country .
While returning to the port to go back to the cruise on that journey of the market if our eyes go to the water of the sea then it feels as if the people here do the beauty of the beauty .
The water was so clean that in the light of the lamppost the fish swimming deep in the bottom is seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which is completely connected to the city .
If you can see a few centimetres of sea or river water near any city of India then you will consider yourself to be very good .
While returning from M . . Aquamorine two hours of the evening spent in the garland wear romance in the mind .
Prawal rock -LRB- Monga stone -RRB- is a life here .
So much that you will also find pearls on the stones of the graveyard .
After listening to the speech of President Nasid some time we stood outside his official residence .
Truth did not seem that we are standing outside the residence of one highest handicraft of the country and no one is safe at a distance .
In fun we used to take photographs of only 50 metres long gardens and carpets by handing them inside the gate of their bungalow .
Can we think about the house of any leader in India
It was also understood that President sometimes crossing the road on foot on his own reaches his office two houses ahead .
Everything in the context of Maldives was enhancing eagerness .
That is why I used to wait for the next day very carefully .
It seemed that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a name from cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we rotated the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Mala then we immediately knew the plane going upwards .
I had seen so many photographs , their .
But then it was not imagined that on the next day there would be an opportunity to roam from it .
By the sea plane of Tross Maldives we were going to Rangali island one hundred and five kilometres long .
It is unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and islands spread on the sea of Maldives by a sea plane flying at a height of about thousand metres .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
With thrill and excitement one has to fly to stop breathing .
But on reaching Konrad Resort of Hilton Hotel on Rangali Island it seems as if we have reached a different world .
In such a world which has nothing to do with any outside world .
There was no such relationship that it was not possible to get out the beauty and rest like there .
The journey of Konrad can also be done on foot or by a battery-driven car .
While going from the port to the main island the view of water on both the sides of the bridge becomes unique .
Now we could not separate ourselves from the surrounding nature but reached such a place which was unimaginable .
While descending from stairs to several metres below the sea sea we went to such a room of glass which was in water .
Our room was later a dining room .
On crossing the glass everywhere we could see unique kinds of small fishes , sprawls , snorkelling and scuba diving men .
The imagination of eating sitting on the tables there was very thrilling .
The cost of a person to see the sea plane coming to this island from Mala and lunch inside the water is 47 thousand rupees .
There was no desire to return .
We were ready to leave our passport in water .
But it was known that this is not possible .
Returned with this hope with a heavy mind that Nashib would sometimes return to this place .
For many days it was decided to go away from Delhi but because of the busyness of work he was not able to get rid of .
Since childhood wildlife was interested then we thought why do not give a gift to Jim Corbett at this time .
This was the second bike journey in Ladakh after the bikeing till Pegong lake near Khardungla in 2006 .
On 27 in the afternoon we went out of Delhi to Jim Corbett but the enthusiasm that we had gone out , it started sliding our speed with a storm .
The journey between Hapur to Gajraula was really tiring .
Washing from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that we fell now .
How to reach Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was driven near the park which we had already registered .
That day there was no special program but despite being cold we first went to tour on the banks of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to see Corbett Museum near Dhangadi Gate at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went out to tour Ramnagar below .
It took a lot of evening while returning .
While leaving Delhi we decided that the lion roaming openly in the jungle would definitely be seen so that all night I could see a lion in dreams .
In the darkness of the night I suddenly heard a loud scream and after that the dogs started hungrying which did not stop for two hours .
Initially we decided to see Kaladhungi and Corbett Falls .
Kalatungi is 30 kilometres long while Corbett Fall is situated on the road .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatungi where some important things related to his personal life are kept .
At 12 . 00 o'clock till the return .
Kalatungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett had settled after coming to this village .
On reaching the resort Safari Jeepsy used to wait for us .
It was said that they have arranged for sitting in the number one of the sites of Bijrani there .
On being asked about one number we told that there is more greenery and tigers come to the same place to escape from cold .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees to roam for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two toxic elephants inside who had long - long teeth .
I did a lot of photography .
During this time the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are approximately 150 tigers in the park out of which some died .
At some places we also saw the signs of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
My head was filled with lion fences .
Then I remembered one of my friends of Haldani .
I gave him the same phone .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked whether he saw the tiger or not .
Put that word like an arrow .
I spoke slowly , no .
There was no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody told us that you take a ride to go inside .
