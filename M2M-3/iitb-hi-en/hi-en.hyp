Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the highway system, while many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which is fit on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every milestone run by the motor-driver and communicates the information to the authorities, has now become the issue of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the old system to fund the major roads in the US.
Generally, boiling work like highway planning has also become an issue of sudden deep debate and vibrant coalitions.
In order to keep details of the miles you drive and possibly the drive space - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - the government has joined the Liberatorian environmental groups to support the government in favor of allowing them to use these black boxes.
The tea party is a madman.
The US Civil Freedom Union is also very worried raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether or not to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are searching for how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver will pay for every miles fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken black boxes for test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"It is not a matter of being elected or not by us, it is to say that Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California government association, who is planning to start tracking every milestone fixed by motor drivers in California by 2025."
We are going to change the way we pay tax.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has become almost bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes made by American citizens on the gas pump.
American people do not buy as much gas before.
Now in a gallon gas, the car runs more than ever before.
There was no increase in the Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.
Due to high prices of gas, politicians avoid increasing one money in tax.
Transport Policy expert Lee Munikh at Minesota University says, "Gass tax is not at all relevant.
Their state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Wonx it is called a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good for urban liberals as it can change taxes to change the mode of driving for example, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the target set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
In the region, the Vice-President of the policy, Adrian Moor said, "This is not just a tax which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 had graceed to move forward towards the payment of per-mile from the Congress.
US Senate had sanctioned a 90-million-dollar test project last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing people who had to go to work daily or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most interested oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Newada has already completed the initial test.
New York city is also moving forward in this direction.
Elinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Sebord, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Newada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly ago, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor every step of them.
Alauddin Khan, who guided strategic and performance management in the Newada Transport Department, says, "There was a major problem about Big Brother and other similar things."
This is not a thing that people wanted.
With the proceeding of the test, ACLU of Newada had warned on its website: "It will be very easy to convert these devices into full trekking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unregistered technology infrastructure, which has to be spread in an essential way to keep every persons daily travel records.
Newada is one of the many states which are making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is running every day, but not where and when it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the small California Start-up called Tru Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device that it is testing is good for the highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
Ryan Morison, Chief Executive of True Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of the people, they will be more interested in adopting this method."
There have been some big mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are very less expensive and less interference methods to do so.
In Organ, the planners are using different options to the drivers.
They can choose the device of GPS or without GPS.
Or can not choose any device again, but can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of the average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, "payment insurance as per your drive, and will create a collection of actual time data from other drivers, which can be used to avoid motorcycle traffic. "
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussions on payment according to the milestone are a big deal.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fee can also be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their proper share.
Randy Rentsheller, Director of the Legislative and Public Affairs of the Commission said, "When Aspirin can work, what is the need for a radical surgery for him."
If we do this then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a drakula for children's blood, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.

Even before this, once the court has turned down the demand of Asaram to ban media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS and paid the related financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the rupee of TDS kept depositing itself.
On October 17, the search team from Mumbai on this group took action with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the team of TDS started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The danger of sealing of accounts was raided and surveyed on the group of mall operators about 15 days ago.
Angered by this action, the trader has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking action.
In this case, the officials investigating the matter have clarified that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
Given this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized a glimpse of 5 thousand from Mawa and uetta Colony, 70 thousand from Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for poor flour from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department got information about bringing the poor maternal uncle in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave's consignment from transport garage is being called Nagpur.
The department took possession of this mave, which was valued at Rs 70 thousand.
The fear of action did not give any right to the mave.
The department destructed it as an unauthorized property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caters located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spectacles.
The chemical called Sodium Hydrosulphate was used to shining and stay for more days.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S. Deshmukh, co-chairman of the department said that the campaign for arrest of chemical sweets and poor and fake cattle will continue.
In the next few days, the information about speeding up this campaign has been given by the department.

Appeal to be cautious of fake sweets and cattle has been made to the people from the department.
Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received him strongly at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for Satwana Yatra organized by the BJP.
The organization of Satwana Yatra is the exercise of rubbing the families of the people killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the terrorists of Indian Mujahideen who were involved in the blasts was to make a stampede during the rally, so that maximum people were casualties and there was an atmosphere of panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared a martyr by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday with bones and bones from their village.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Satwana Yatra is organized as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from seven o'clock on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, they will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the families of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the blasting victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
Due to the rain, after two consecutive one-day matches were washed, India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case and its batsmen performed a blast and gave him a record victory, so that the team equals 2-2 in the series.
Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsman.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the greatest goal is also proving to be in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such a salute pair in the form of Rohit and the summit which is easing the work of the rest of the batsmen with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a grand partner in opening.
On the third, Kohli has performed so far, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket Pandits have termed them better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has set up 17 ODF centuries, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, his average is above 80. 00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly floping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, they can work as a good innings 'lifeline' in Bangalore ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsman, especially captain George Beli, has influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding to be taken to the test team for the domestic access series against England.
Australia has good batsman up to ninth.
Besides Beli, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fockner have done good batting in the series.
However, Phil Hunge and Aaron Finch have not left any effect in opening.
The lack of Mitchell Johnson in bowling may be heavy to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed spectacularly so far in the series, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashage series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this displayed peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate terrorists around 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has worsened even more.
Referring to the Pakistani visit of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lieutenant General ahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizbul's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism will be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Suicide attacks in the killing of soldiers on the border, Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for ending the privileges of the army in such a situation as fatal, the BJP leader said that doing such things till there is permanent peace in the state is also anti-people.
These give greed to anti-national elements.
He insisted that the statements of the leaders of the army, security forces should be banned.
Snow Dan ready to collaborate with Germany on American vigilance
American intelligence informer, Edward Snow Den, has declared that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director Kith Alexander failed to answer their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr. Snow Den Seguruwar in Russia, where he has been sheltered to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den to the media in Berlin on Friday, "Though the results of my efforts are quite positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party-change, and does not provide any rescue, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of felony. "
However, speaking the truth wasn't a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include theft from intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Fredrick, German Internal Affairs Minister, told Online Heit: Mr Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has bug the phone of Chancellor Angela Markel.
Thomas Operman, Member of Parliament, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, supervises intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snow Den had an opportunity to cry as a witness, "It should also be taken without completely wasting relations with the US and bringing them to danger."
An MP from Germany's Green Party, Mr. Snow Belle, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their trip to Russia.
Mr. Belen said, according to former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Den is not able to go back to Russia.
If Snow Den testifies in Germany, he'll be safe there, which will need assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr Snow Den said, "He had to face fearless and sustainable campaign, he had to be forced to leave home.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by comprehensive responses to its work of political expression.
In addition to the United States - world citizens as well as high officials have estimated the revelation of a irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with the German authorities , When the problems of human status have been solved .
Rontier Airlines will charge carry - on baggage
Rontier Airlines plans to charge 100 to store goods for passengers on its plane board.
Rontier Airlines plans to start a charge for 100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday it announced that passengers can keep the entire box.
New carry - On fee is for bags in overhead bin, so, under the seat, small bags will still be charged free.
Drontier said that 25 will charge if paid in advance, 100 will have to wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Trantier spokesman Kate O'Mailly said that 100 fees have to be obtained to take care of the charge in the advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger fees as much as they can do in the carry-on baggage, which is stash in overhead box, means that this box is often less space.
There's a way to reduce the passengers on the fee board.
O'Mailly said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers to find out the overhead bin's faster.
Passengers who buy tickets in their airline website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay 100 for the same bag, while on a frontier gate a passenger can get a bag free of cost.
O'Mailly said that the procedures of Rontier's website and check-in are being changed to ensure that the passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Drontier's new carry-on fee will not start till summer, though a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction over baggage fees and other fees, but the airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
The bagge fees on the Wall Street are looking at many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of deficit.
Most of them have not even touched the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. Carry-on fee started for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with a fee, another airline is Hungary's i Air, which airline adviser J Sorensen said, and who tracks the Ad-on-Fees.
He said that Spirit's Carry-on fee brings 50 million in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew to Spirit and passengers had to face the carry-on abnormal bag fees on the gate.
"Bording process that I saw in my airline career was simple, he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and look out at a fight gate.
The plane was full and they said it was licketty-split.
Drontier is also following 2 fees for coffee, tea, soda, or spirit for juice.
Drontier said that those passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and give it free coffee only once.
It'll still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after seven months of the complaint of the passengers, they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If Trantier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, then this move of Drontier to charge the fee on the carry-on is his latest effort to operate customers towards his own website.
Airlines pays online travel vendor rbit for 10 to 25 each sold ticket like this.
This is the reason why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
Drontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
In September many often started giving flying miles from half for those customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles longer trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It is also that they allow the only passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Rontier website.
In the Denver of Rontier, there is a loyal base of customers in the city of your house, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue decline by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to decide the financing of the Rontier as part of the sale of the airline.
NSA accused the "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortage, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
Intelligence Agency said in the statement sent to the email, "NSA.gov was not reaching for several hours tonight, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be solved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial [DDOS] attack of service.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not in access.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was no negotiation with the internal, sensitive network of the agency.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hectic group has claimed online that they are responsible for interrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity till the site is closed due to the overload of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unfinished and the purpose of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the system.
The former most mysterious NSA, which was once named "no such agency", has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people in the past months due to the incidents of excessive foreign and domestic espionage programmes - which was collectively disappeared by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, secreted NSA files from the agency and after the revelation.
Due to this growing controversy about the agency, after the night incident, there was speculation that this incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
Beautiful expression was presented in line with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing reconciliation in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.

Bombardier's profit declining as aircraft delivery, decline in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a decline of 15 percent in the net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and on contract issues less than the aircraft order and pressure by delivery.
Montrial based Bombardier also released any flight test data for his brand new series aircraft or his ambitious program to go to commercial service from September next did not present an update on issues.
After the first flight of the test aircraft, almost half a month ago, it has been blown just three times, the question has been raised whether the test phase is on track or not.
Result has fallen less than forecast and shares have been sent to the Toronto stock exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
A analyst share with Cameron Dorsen, National Bank Financial on Thursday reduced its rating for "regional performance" from Mat on Thursday, the stock is limited above the next one or two quarters.
"Strong aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with marginal performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will get a new order for the Bombardier Ceries as the progress of the flight testing programme.
However, if no new order is being announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be suspected.

New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal on one side and start walking against the rule.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Eclass School of Business of UTA.
According to the researchers, in the morning, we prefer ethical values, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to tiredness or more pressure.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the correct answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
At the same time, while experimenting people between 12 pm and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their sources in mind.
With this, researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr. Big is imprisoned by Cocaine's accustomed lawyer who gives secret information about police investigations
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro
The advocate thought that people could know about his confidential drug addiction .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by Liverpool Crown Court
The top advocate of the defendant, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his drug addiction will be known to the people about his secret addiction, three years of imprisonment has been done.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising with his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro.
This advocate, who was named "Bash", and whose criminals were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarboro, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackbern, Lancashire, while he went out with his colleagues for Law Society dinner.
After getting cocaine particles in Detta's hair, its bats and its credit card, it was found in the investigation that Detta was a regular user of drugs of A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lankashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons who were sent to jail after the police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and more than 200,000 pounds during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he feared that people did not know about his cocaine addiction.
The situation in Blackband was found guilty in the Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of interrupting the path of justice after the trial lasted for three weeks in the Leverpool Crown Court, which was working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors.
He had admitted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The worst time of the lawyer started when the police came to know that he was regularly in touch with Ditta on the phone from February 2011 while investigating the Scarboro.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to the house of Detta and keeping a drug of more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After drug addiction, Scarboro was regularly in touch with Ditta, who went out for dinner at Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when the clues of drugs of A category were found on the hair, spinach and credit cards of the detta, he was found to be a regulated user of cocaine in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use Cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of "different privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by removing his bullet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run office from his workplace as well as from his house, and his clients used to call at his house for legal matters.
After telling the main persons arrested, what the spy knew about them, it was said in the court hearing that Dita used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had earlier presented the case.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal advocate should be well aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, being very much associated with his specific client.
We are not talking about the common drug dealer, but about a dealer that is providing drugs to our lawyer.
Some of his talks must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his boundary of lawyer-client relationship.
As much as he was possible, he interrupted the police investigation so that he could be able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession but insulting.
He made a lot of close proximity to some certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed an agreement with his freedom.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I do this work immediately. "
But after the hearing, Superintendant Lee Helstead of the Lankashire Police said that at the time when Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself to a criminal advocate.
Due to the addiction of his cocaine, he made excessive agreements and became very weak to the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and fill confidence and confidence among the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and has tried to avoid his profession.
The Criminal and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now interrupting the path of justice, which reflects our commitment to bring the criminals to the court.
This matter should work to warn the criminals that no person is away from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarboro was given 14 years imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and beetles.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about him, in which he said that his fantassy job would be to become a lawyer for the death penalty client in America, Mohammed Ali's dinner being guest and inequality to his work. Be inspired.

Ray Namo was once an infamous rebel in the movement supported by the White-ruled Rodesia and the South African diversity government as part of the efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that there is no possibility of returning to the country's fully developed struggle, but recent incidents have encouraged foreign investors and local people.
The stake has been high for the fast growing economy, some of the companies, including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Nni, can be brought out of the investment of more than 50 billion dollars next year.
The ruling Relimo Party, since 1975, blames each other for major political power, and Ray Namo tension.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle by starting attacks on its members in Sofa La province, traditional Ray Namo Garh on October 17.
The attack on the former rebels and the resumption of the government forces attacked the Renmo bases and told the Financial Times to try to kill the spokesman of Afonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Majhang, Ray Namo.

Our vision is to come back to the agreement, but seriously, Mr. Majhangne said.

"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave Presidentship because he does not want peace, does not want a transparent election, Mr. Majhang said..
What kind of capacity has not been clarified by Ray Namo, but he has made a visit to police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway ..
Most of the clashes are in the La province, at a distance of several hundred kilometers in the north of Jomaputo, in which the host is Bira Port, which trusts exporting minerals, coal including Rio Tinto and the valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo line, Rio suspended his experiment for nearly a week in June.
Whether Ray Namo would repeat this danger or not, Mr. Majhangwineet was almost asked.
Ray Namo Cheese was not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, Shri Majhang said.
The government of instability enhanced the thorns, Fernando Leema, Media Cop, says, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods of kidnappings.
"People have the government and the president responsible for the country's future, and it seems that they should be one to find solutions for problems, "We say."

Cross Lee Holland, who has translated BioWulf from Anglo Saxon, along with writing Penguin books of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, he said, "Your intentions can be a lot but it will be better to keep it out of view.

Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Colson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused that he used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his customary relations while being the Home Secretary of Charles Clark.
Prosecutor Andrew Adis .C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clark is joining his "charming special adviser Hannah Polbi".
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Dusseyer to hack Polby's voicemail and keep that male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Adis said that "The application side suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, but he keeps articles in front of the people, see what people react to it. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to investigate matters: phone hacking, monitoring and meeting.
The third person himself was involved in the editor.
It is obvious that he knew about other ways i.e. Nigarni, he definitely knew.
What about the first one
Did he know about phone hacking
He says, no, we say that "Yes, he knew absolutely."
Rumor about Clark's dramatic relations was presented for the first time by the feature desk of AOTW when a source of sexually interested in Ms. Polby had said: "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.
In August 2006, the tape of Voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Polby's phone from home to Muktair.
The investigators also found such entries in the computer of the private investigator on which Ms. Polbi and his sister were named "Project".
During the period where he was being investigated, information was sought about Ms. Polbi's grandmother by calling anonymity.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Navilie Thurlbek and former reporter James Weatherup saw Ms. Polby's visit monitoring.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Adis said that the involvement of Colson in this case is only in the parton with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blonket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson interacted with Mr. Blanket about Pranay Relations with a married woman, while at that time he was watching the case of co-conservative Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Colson and Brux refused to misbehave with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200.9 and August 9, 2006.
Mughaleyer, Thurlbek and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
Promote corporate fear from NSA ' s disclosure on State Monitoring .
On a calm day in August, a German police helicopter greeted the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
The German media asked the BB to express hope to identify the presence of Lisening Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of American National Intelligence, insisted that the US should use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and increase American companies their international competitiveness or increase the line below them.
But since Edward Snowden, the treasure of the secrets of a contractor who made a whistleblower, started telling the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and the business world are no longer sure that the director will follow his promise or not.
Told that the American National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and K and Yahoo, including our cloud providers Google and Yahoo, expressed fear of state monitoring.
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bug, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then certainly the leaders of the business world are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made intense cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should wake up, Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US is now almost a big risk, like China, when it comes to steal industrial espionage and data.
There, however, there is no evidence that the US has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies in all documentations.
Politicians have expressed consciousness in the absence of the Internet capabilities of the European Union and should strive to reduce their dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gradually open them again...
He said, "This is not a way", the president of Hasso Platner, German business software company SAP.
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then it was not allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to cars and farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations exposed by Snowden about American technical research and detective access have proved to be a trauma for some companies which had earlier believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
There is a major change in the Cloud Computing Centre , where European officials are more aware that the data collected in the United States are under the jurisdiction and , therefore , have become possible sensitive .
According to a survey excluded by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, Co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP says, "We saw a new question which did not come to the customers a year ago - he is - Where is my data collected And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming whether they already knew: The powerful states want to steal their most precious mysteries and data and therefore they should be guarded at every cost.
That is economic espionage, it is not a surprising thing.
It has always been happening.
"This is a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changed Curt Bock, chemical producer BASH's chief executive."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, it has been recording messages for a long time, whether it is unable to leave one in the business from home with a Usb stick, or leaving a laptop in a hotel room, it is unable to say at least.
Clich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Car Producer Audi says that it is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening equipments.
Germany's BB executive, while smart phones are compromising due to risks on foreign tours, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many companies are the top in the global market in a special place.
Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secret effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of their own companies.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is named in another tire of criminals engaged in hacking for economic intelligence behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a Board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to make economic spy, French is the worst
In an interview, former head of the Bernard Suarcini French internal intelligence agency URI, explains: "Services well know that even though all the countries join the non-terrorist battle, they spy on their colleagues."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
No fool made.
"The parents of Georgia's teenage killed in a unique accident believe that his son was murdered"
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in a restaurant mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. K. K. K. K. K. Johnson was found trapped in the mat standing behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators of the Lawndess County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a "nough accident", but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Rangp, who presented Kenneth and Jackline Johnson, told Fox News Dot Com that "He completely believes that his son has been killed."
They do not have any faith in Sherif's described way.
Ranp said that "He believes that this thing is beyond the logic of physical rule and general intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the protection of a person or people responsible for the death of his son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag."
US Advocate General Michael Mulare said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he be murdered due to any crime
Mure said this in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring the truth forward.
He said that "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that the initial dead body test indicates that Johnson's death was resulted in conditional respiratory respiratory.
According to Moore, there was a different reason for death in a second body test.
He said that "There are many questions, which should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he gets enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, then he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not available immediately for comment from the Lawnscountry Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the Judge of Southern Georgia ordered the officers to issue all monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that the video footage will give some indications how he died.
CDC releases guidelines for allergy of children for schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines to control the food allergy of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now in the US, one out of every 20 children has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergy cases in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, schools have been informed how teachers and employees should be informed about the food allergy of children, and how to handle it in case of any allergic response.
Schools have also been suggested to keep an appenafrine stock to face potentially deadly acceleration (Anafilexis) - which is the auto-engester of the APPAN Brand, which is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It seems that something is kissing in my tongue, "It seems that there is hair on my tongue, or "My tongue is kissing."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose their children ' s sex undefined
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for the children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified in a conservative manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender "undefined or "undefined" on the birth certificate of the child.
The objective of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can take quick decisions related to gender specification for newborn children, and fight against discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, "No I am a man, nor a woman."
I will remain the wounded, stained packed by the doctors.
According to estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such that there is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexes, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, is a collective word which is used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (foot or wounds) or abnormally developed gender.
It may be that Valis Sympson is intersex.
Gender identification is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information to specify gender when gender can not be determined and surgery, if such a situation comes, inspect the psychological and physical development of the child before it comes.
Dr. Jack Dresser, a psychologist of New York City, who is a specialist in gender-delivery affairs, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good things."
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life-crime, for which surgery is needed, but this does not happen with most children."
You can specify the gender without surgery, and after that see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a sex will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex people have been described as transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to gender, but relates to its biological composition, which is not obviously male or female, but either combined or defined by both.
These features can display themselves as secondary gender characteristics such as the weight of muscles, hair distribution, breast and length elementary gender characteristics like reproductive organs and genitals or chromosome structure and hormone.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by Intersex and Transgenders in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-corresponding gender.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark adults, men, women or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry Me-Welby became the world's first recognized genderless person after winning the legal appeal to keep "undefinite gender status".
According to the internal ministry, in addition to M or F in German passport, there will be a third specification for Intersex persons as .
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed the petition for withdrawal of gender theory from school books.
US website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going to a state where sex is an option to be elected, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more columns of civilization in the opposite direction. "
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told Baby one that she would like to see the children being specified at the time of birth.
He said on the website about upbringing, "In addition to the extra boundaries, the upbringing is very tense, especially if you do not even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and determination.
Historically, children born with genitals, both men and women, were called Hermafrodites (Ubhayalingi), which was in the name of beautiful Greek God, who was biling.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered Ling as a slate which was erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the morality of surgery, they understand that sex and digestion is a complicated work, and sometimes there can be a mistake from doctors, who do not know what the children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
The dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Manorog Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vague reproductive organs was presented by Dr. John Mani, University of John Hapkins, who considered gender as golden.
He composed the word gender identification and argued how social and environmental signs - parents raise the child - interact with the genes and hormones of the child to be recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as John John, their principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender gender was accidentally sex during the sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex .
The dresser said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of the postponement, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following his representation.
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after 1990, the people passing through these sex surgery started coming out, "The result was not happy."
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with .Y. Man chromosome, but his genitals were vague.
The doctors did not understand clearly that their sex was small, or his scarcity was big, but they were sure that he could never live a satisfaction life as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, the external organ of the bruce and the ovary were removed by surgery and her upbringing was done like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew that I am not a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vaginoplasty.
But while feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the terrible truth.
At the time of birth I was bonded - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not be developed properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breasts.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to the people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, Annie Tamer-Mattis, Executive Director of Advocates for Informed Choice, a legal group based in California, expresses concern that Germany's law invites Chippy and Talk.
They say, "A lot of activists feel that the law of Germany will inspire parents to take quick decisions and specify the child "undeterminated".
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We feel that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify male or female sex.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tammer-Mattis said that his organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to be recognized in the third gender.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decisions about diverse gender."
The law of Germany relates to specify it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their own body.
But Pittsburg's Breast Radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who help hundreds of others in the support group, said that the law of Germany will give empowerment to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Kati was born with male chromosomes, but she was D.S.D. named Full Androgen Insensitivity Conservation.
Since there was a fault in his endrogen grhahi, women characters developed in the cattle.
There is a vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary gland.
Now 29-year-old CATI is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Although she is barren, she expects to be a mother through adoption or guest surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents that they do not take any decision on their own in haste."
It gives them understanding and time by some tests before writing, male or female.
In this way, you are okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy it.
We do not need to get such surgery done in haste, which can not be returned.
He said, "This brings children in the process of decision-making and frees parents from the mischief that inspires parents because they do not believe that they are doing well."
Finally, the child will determine which gender she is more simple - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Possible switch was a very safe mystery within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office .
The changes of former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerod and David Paluffa were under consideration, including only half a dozen President's close advisor.
World Down claims , Dale tried to change Biden , despite his personal synergy , ultimately before deciding , when his information was telling him that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I kept the whole scene in mind, and one of them, this was the cast told the newspaper."
You remember that at that time the presidential post was in danger, then we were in such a situation that, "Pavitra Christ, what else will we do
While Dale told the research as a precaution, Martin had told the UNN's Andresson Cooper that the election campaign again made important investments, it was found that how much the claim will be given to the poll.

Glo-in-the-Dark Ice Cream prefers
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-the-Dark Ice Cream - Jailifish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of maritime animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a research paper on the jailfish and China's convinced scientists used the chemical brightness to revive the protein.
Ice cream will increase the PH level of protein by reacting to the tongue of the eater and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream brightens with reacting to the heat of the mouth, that is, winning will be more shining, the more it will be shining.
Charlie, founder of Like M. IM Delicius Icecream Company, said, "This is unbelievable, but initial days' production will get me about 200 grams of goods."
The protein we're using in the ice cream will react with the neutral PH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth becomes hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will be shining.
We have been testing for the past few months and it looks absolutely right to share it on helovin because it gives a wonderful bright effect .
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream which has made mane because the glow of the jailfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So every scoop costs me around 140 pounds .
Although Viska taste is very good.
Lapne is famous for abnormal taste, including experimental company, beer, paneer, meat and gold leaves based in Charlie's Bristal.
But his next composition is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
It is naturally impossible that due to ice crystal, which makes ice cream upside down, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a reflective feature of a prisonfish which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists

However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach the house.

It is true that the StrathClide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of independent traffic with the rest of Europe, although forecasting - it was not described in Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules as per their requirements.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shangen region, Brussels will actually be cheaper for non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting whatever he wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Khani.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has been frozen. First of all, I mean "freedom" means passport control baseless news was heard about 40 years ago.
Yet this interesting old story lost an interesting point in re-expecting.
Anyway, why should you expect the bidding of Europe from independent Scotland
Why should Yoke of London be bought for Brussels, especially now
Here is the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organise Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe is officially dead.
Dedicated parties are strengthening the entire EU to oppose EU or to shut down Euro as the same currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptile Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and won about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections in September, and thus free democrats (equivalent to our lib dams) effectively excluded the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be roughly transformative.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, due to obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone very far.
In the excessive budget deficit of national governments, the crisis of Euro was not very much - it was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce salaries and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems, deep European productivity is sick.
In order to discount French and German energy firms on the expenditure of consumers - as a result of the green energy policies set up by Brussels, European industries double the electricity for the UN and four times the gas.
This is a paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in the Grangemouth.
To freeze all the wages in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry can not be saved from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once the chief fan of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians had seen the EU as a measure to control Germany, and to provide Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the economy of France is stagnating.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing, the anti-EU National Front has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist in third place in the recent by-election.
At present, the Front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the votes - it is a timely warning for the British Labor that they can not assume that the disintegration for the left, will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his new fame among the French shells, the working class
This party wants to use the EU elections to be held next year in the European Parliament to create an anti-EU, anti-exclusive anti-monetary group.
If, as much as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then such a group can influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-religious anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will eliminate Euro.
Euro will not be completely eliminated, but it will return to the Footworth (Sabrabhu) nations in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General de Gaul.
Germany and some of its following economies can maintain Euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currency.
I hope the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing the close proximity with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
After all, what will happen to Scotland
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the relaxed European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easy to work together with non-UN countries in Europe with other similar thinking countries.
Otherwise, we should think of maintaining our economic freedom while walking on the path of Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - notablely - has been the most successful anti-economy political campaign in Europe, which won a wonderful majority in 2011 on the basis of the deductions proposed by Labor Chancellor Elistair Darling and after that on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dam coalition.
It will be absurd to vote for independence at this time for Scotland, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of the monetary imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young before time: grew up quickly
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get youth at a young age compared to their age-old girls.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is near .
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of young age
The case of youth before time is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent PAT Etheries is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8
In the annual conference of the American Child Medical Academy at Orlando, Florida this week, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a child medical endocrinelogist, clarified that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, these new trends show.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in giving confidence to parents - that generally it does not show fast progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as sprouting of breasts, genitals and hair of wrist and physical smell are seen before time in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of menstruation (first menstruation).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breasts start developing, it takes at least two to three years in the first menstruation, Caplovitz explains, "The premature youth in girls: The guidance required to deal with this common problem is also the author of the guide. "
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
What is the beginning of the youth, there is a debate about this, but when there is an increase in the breast development before the age of 8, two it is called 'Bal-Adult'.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - whose child doctor can inspect nearby.
In case of high rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to check so that the prospects of serious problems like tumors or syst can be overcome.
Treatments for delaying premature menstrual cycle and other consequences: premature age increase of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and adult drama.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate and emotional adult.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of medicines but acknowledges, "Suppressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not just want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
Caplovites said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and got disturbed that in his friends, he started the first menstruation.
There are many popular principles about the reasons for untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormone in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sex oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys - like girls - are getting young men from time to time.
Caplovites determine the rule that its main reason is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which connects the fat of the body with the time of sexual intercourse.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have the tendency to gain youth before their age-old girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the representation of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and jeans, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: although boys are getting hair of face and genitals at a young age, but the trend of youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians present at the AAP Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even infants and children, it is common to see the hair of pimples and genitals.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child physician at Gorib Children's Hospital in Moristoun, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of the youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It means to negotiate before the expected time."
If you are calm, your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely, it is a part of normal life.

The big orders of jet manufacturers at stake with dispute for seat width .
This month's Dubai Arsho has set a rhythm for a fight and a competition has taken place among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The dispute focuses on the width of the Economy Class seat in long flights, not always like being given by the airlines, but its allotted position efficiency has been claimed by the Latest Jet Arbus SAS and the Boeing Company.
Erbus is expected to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches (semi) in the Economic Cobin this week, but it should be decided by the airlines, its chief rival Boeing says.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the event of 17-21 , there was a competition to sell a large version of the twelfth engine of the long distance aircraft from the prospectively recorded order .
How the previous department of the aircraft has been created - especially whether the seating is 9 or 10, keeping in mind the claims of high capacity, designs of Mini Jambo Jets are being prepared
Boeing says it has made 777  which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 people in one line in the anonymous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to the 18-inch left 9 equal seat.
Aircraft veterans often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in business press .
Now, Airbus 777 is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsho, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the beginning of the Vigian war has been anything. Showing this to Finsero, will you accept it together in the restaurant
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said that "Boing Regional Turbo" is also presenting a long distance flight in narcotics."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit on the plane has not changed.
According to the figures of the American Health Department , between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jambo One defined the long-term Ki Yatra Ko , and the average weight of the centuries was 40 - 49 year old American male ke me 10 percent .
According to the US Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says that its rival is sticking to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name was the average circumference of the jet set .
Airbus says that he has set up a Research Commission, which suggests improvement in the quality of an additional inch 53 per cent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the Airbus seat measurement data , and said that it is not dependent on the decision of the manufacturers how a balance between airline fares and facilities is made ..
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver said that in reality it tells the airlines to provide flexibility and those things who believe that what they need to do to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they have the benefit.
They know better about their business than anyone else.
It is about the elbow room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, the trading of at least  700 billion is sufficient in the coming decades to tip American and European exports.
The reporter said that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually the issue of fighting between new jet planes.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that per seat has 20 percent efficiency, in their new twin engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 77-300 ere.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends on the comparison of 777  one original 9 with 777 designs .
Comparison is now used to be 10 equivalent to profit in the unit cost.
Kevin Keniston, Head of Airbus Passenger Facility of Europe says, "Boeing is doing this to capture more seats to make our products more competitive.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the denser layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Internal Expert My Karbi, Founder and Editor's Runway Girl Network said that the eighteen-inch seat width will be very good for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus Proposal is operated by the threat of 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While resting, all builders are also providing high density layouts for low-cost air services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But recently, as long as the Airbus stressed on some of its jet aircraft in comprehensive ubin seats for the need for more cabin facility.
Modern jet planes are not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sale.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate fun from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was capable of keeping rats safe from the addiction of nicotine for the whole life.
Prof. Ronald Christal, Professor of Well Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this kind of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus infects the liver cell in a select manner, which after that starts forming a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents the summon of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats which were later given nicotine, continued to do their normal activities.
The researcher says that but the rat that was not given vaccine, it felt good, it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccine had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Christal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, then it can be given to the children before the greed to try cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of nicotine.
But perhaps it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any joy from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in getting rid of their habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned the need to do very much research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual death of the tiger.
The forest department is giving a round-the-clock reply to the death of the tiger in the first sight.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division got a body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
With all the organs of the tiger's body being safe, there was no sign of any wound or injury etc. on it.
On Friday, in the presence of forest patron Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kahksha Nasim, SDO GS Carki, CTR veterinary doctor Bharat and veterinary doctor of Kotabagh Hema Rathore post-mortem of the body of the tiger was done.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tiger is being said to be bad.
This did not find out the reasons for the actual death of the tiger.
On the death of the tiger, the departmental officials continued to respond.
Yet the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for the capsicological examination to confirm the poison.

Tripodi denies us being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the policy of sea lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, former New South Wales patron AD Obide, whose government-controlled three lands were hiding selfish.
The Independent Commission (ICA) on Friday detailed the investigation on Friday, whether Mr. Obide has violated the circulars of lobbying lease policy from several State Ministers, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide, without tender renewed in August 2005 after the expiry of their time.
After the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff, Lin Ashpole on Thursday, the allegation was known by Shri Tripodi Shri Obid's hidden selfishness that is being investigated now.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the public tender for lease.
The lease holders were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, circular enterprises for lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of the public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi had requested a change in government lease policy .
The document presented in a phone calls was Mr Obide and Mr Tripodi and Steve Dun, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries of Mr Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healthy asked Mr Tripodi. "What was the telephone conversation on the development of commercial lease policy, was it being discussed
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I could not remember what was discussed, but it was not definitely.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say that Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter planes targeted Latakia, the port city of Syria on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed the Fox News.
The official did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one purpose.
The report of the Associated Press shows that the target race missiles were SA-125.
Israel has missed air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least two times in this year.
Foreign employees can pass through authenticity test on 457 visas
Authenticity test for foreign employees is being considered by the government on 457 visas as it aims to expand a tough action.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a criteria designed to fill the unskilled posts in Australia or to prevent 457 used for delivery of family and friends in a voluntary manner.
Today, a government discussion paper was issued, condemning the government's words about foreign employees, the former Labor M. P. Maxine Macque said today that it can wrath the neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and strong rhetoric about the job before the Australian people is very unpleasant at a time, while the unions have demanded a safe labor market. "
Historically, it meant that the white labourers should have been protected - and if some people in the area have seen the reflection of that historical evidence, I would not be surprised.
The Discussion Certificate shows the framework of 12 measures, which were first considered by former Minister of State for Immigration Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brandon Oconer, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity norm" is adopted, the visa applicant can be investigated about whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the owner of the visa sponsored person or the relative or personal partner is.
Businesses may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, because the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees kept hundreds of people on work.
During this time, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee died due to suspicious heart attack after a refugee came to the boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a journey with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, one of his elderly cousins tied the dhandhas, who was on the same vessel.
Australian officials transported the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the FS2 Rail Project.
Work by US2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Creamer said that this project will be one of the UK.
Scotland Transport Minister Kith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
In the first phase, the new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands will be included.
Once the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchesters and Leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed links between London and North England from 32. 7 billion to 42.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland transport, directed the US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving the rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glassgo and Edinberg to London for three hours or less.
According to Barones Creamer: Our goal for US2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities including Glassgo and Edinburg, which will be well added due to US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistair Carmical: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keeth Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael to make a clear return to Scotland to the US2 network.
Mr. Brown said, "The high speed rail is likely to gain huge economic benefits from Scotland, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland throughout the UK in the entire case of high speed rail.
Therefore, we are enthusiastic to work in the partnership of the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail in Scotland, creating benefits for all and fulfilling the glassgo-Adinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready to review the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electricity Equipment Rules will still be effective in Australia
Despite the steps taken in the equipment regulations in the US, Australian aviation passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
US federal aviation administration has left the option to change American aviation services companies to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during the important phases of the flight, provided they remain in the air mode.
Passengers can just do this during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Aircraft Service Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Aircraft Service Companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that restrictions on the use of power equipment in important phases of flight in Australia are still effective.
Currently, CASA has no specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the plane, the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operating companies have to ensure that the security system is always completely maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members. "
Virgin, who is already negotiating with LASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the instructions of the regulator.
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by DASA in the matter of allowing the use of power equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we (wireless in-flight entertainment) are in our planes."
uantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said that "According to our current policy, electric equipment can not be used while flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
CAA decisions apply to American allerlines.
Well, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will certainly consider the decisions of the CAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US Aircraft Service Company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Service Companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio distribution from mobile devices as well as amend their rules books, training materials, care-on baggage programmes and brief details to the passengers.
CAA said that after verification of the tolerance of their plane by airlines, they will allow passengers to use light weight power equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to stop their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or keep in the upper boxes while flying and landing.
Ponbrokers' silver due to the difficulty of the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying his gold bandit, ring and swinging to pay his daughter's school fee in Ponshop in Bendamier Shopping Center in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is trapped in it.
They say that, although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as administrator, and their husbands also do jobs, but the monthly income of the family remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic loans are increasing - Valuemax, where they are doing their transactions, this week Singapore Stock Exchange became the third ponshop to be listed.
Making jewellery mortgage is not the only way to get cash - Ms. Amirthalinga's case is 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsafe bank loans are cheaper.
Generally, Ponbrokers take interest of 17 per annum in Singapore, which is slightly higher than 15.4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local borrower whose branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not having a credit examination or a certificate of salaries, and they can provide loans more faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning to a ponshop due to the increasing expenditure of livelihood by families and the increase in domestic and consumer loans.
After the global financial calamity, strong growth for five years and simplified monetary policy in developed economies, following affordable credit, the low and medium income families are moving on a ponshop to meet their needs.
This week, Rating Agency, Standards and Purses mainly described the increasing domestic benefits due to the increasing mortgage as a risk factor for the eligibility of Asian banks.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic loan in proportion to GDP.
Malaysia is ranked highest in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged slightly from technology recession this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a decrease in continuous export recession and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B. economist Song Seng Won said, "The decisive point is that with the rising prices, people coming from the middle to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way."
In the last two years, historically high values in gold prices have inspired people to pledge personal property as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of ornaments of their family.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 pon outlets of City-State are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of sleep is good, let's keep grandmother's gold chain pledge, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest Ponshop Director, Ezimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that in Bendimer, Outlet Director Valuemax and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where there are four shops, but also outside Asia, Valuemax Executive Director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with a 60 percent use of 66 million Singapore dollars in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While due to high interest rates, some discount launders (lenders) have been criticized, Ms. Yah says that there is no cheaper rate than other mortgage lenders, but it does not directly increase the debt.
They say, the consumers pledge such things which they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
Ponbroking's social acceptance is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use Valuemax Outlets, they mortgage gold bars or rollex clocks, which can get cash payment up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers of all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "There are rich individuals who need loans for business undertakings or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani's Wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her berth-day not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.

Rescue package of  325 million for TAGI's health
The Union Government has insisted that strict conditions are also linked to the rescue package of  325 million for the ill health system of Tasmania, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking immediate action to solve the existing crisis due to the old population of the island state, high rate of resurgent diseases and the boundaries of the system.
The financing to be done during four years was decided after consultation with the Independent MP of Tasmania Andrew Wilki.
The Government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe that it will address the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous collected cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in clinic at Hobart and Lonsestation, better care after going from hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record system in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the best ways I am told to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading physicians.
The Minister emphasized that the Tasmania government will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The state has to maintain the current financing level to get the Commonwealth Money and report every month where additional funds are being spent.
The Commission of three Members will be constituted to ensure that the State provides services in an efficient and efficient manner.
Mr. Wilki said that  325 million will not mean much unless actual reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level.
Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in the beginning of May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the federal assistance package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state-region public health system from the crisis-hit list.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will primarily reverse the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Datton believes that today's announcement is "Band-Ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You cannot consider taking about half billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Shri Datton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that no one of the rescue packages will be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its capacity to build chemical weapons
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas war material, while in the northern part of Syria, fierce conflict emerged, which is very close to the place where poisonous agents are considered to be kept.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Syria's civil war, which started almost three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Arms Prohibition Organization took place one day before the last date of 1st November .
Which was determined by the Hague-based organization to destroy or make Dumscuss all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases to mix chemicals and to destroy the machinery used to fill the war material.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Dumscus by the middle of 2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mastard gas and nervous agent Sarin.
The UK status Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, experts believe that it is a chemical weapon manufacturing unit as well as a collection center.
The movement group, which has details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 common citizens including 6,365 children are included.
It has been said by the government that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah are militants.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of which are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing struggle since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Asad's military team continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties on both sides, but clearly said nothing.
This war reflects the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
In a statement to the OPCW, who worked together with the United Nations, it was said that its team is still satisfied and has confirmed - and all the declared important production and mixing equipment of Syria have been seen in destruction.
It also said, "There is no plan for further inspection activity."
At the beginning of this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Dumscus.
The inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centres, where the OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
Director General of the Group, Akhit Ujumku, who monitored the remarks issued by OPCW, said, "I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission so far by this organization."
This Home War, which has been running for three years, is mainly a struggle between the Assad government and its security forces, including the members of the Shia Islam, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdur Rahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the Air Defence Center in Latakia, the coastal area of Syria.
He said that the reason for this blast is not known yet.
Police have recovered photographs of counterfeit registry, counterfeit stamps, laptops and counterfeit registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar located in Haboval, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.

Not only that, after that, the real registry was disappeared and offered to the forged registry record.
After this the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on fake papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this the real owner of the land was a push account of the police and administration.
The accused who were preparing the forged registry used to keep a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the forged registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told in the inquiry that they have so far prepared forged registry of 150.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are also registered against gangster Rajiv.
Resent on the punishment of a bomb blaster in Bali
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blast in 2002 expressed their displeasure over the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast and said that Umar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who was running as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that this person, called the infamous "demolitional person" as the master person who made the bomb, was a death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Parth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stop his tears, he said that Patek should have been given a death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told the AAP, "He should be placed in front of the firing team.
I have to live without my grandfather and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, after 11 o'clock in the night, the name of this club was erased after the bomb blasts loaded in the van outside the entire club.
Peter Hughes was in the padies bar at the time of the blast of the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide attackers just 20 seconds ago.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to a month long coma and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment, which was given to three other members of the Jemmah Islamist terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Saudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be punished before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get 20 years of punishment.
Patek is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb blasters.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but finally in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the US army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contacts between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really the sadness of bringing mental pain to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year many tears will flow.
Still Patek can appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft Travelers can now use the gadget in the airplane (But cell can not call the phone)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, movies, listen to music from entering the gate to descend from the gate - but they will not be able to talk to their cellphone - This is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines will have to show how their planes complete the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training books and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Jetbu are among the airlines who have already submitted the plans.
FAA said in a statement, "On the basis of the plan situation, we can soon approve the expansion of the electronic device."
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the door of the plane is closed.
They are expected to not start them till they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the plane and allow them by Captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again while landing the plane, and do not start it until the plane is completely descended.
FAA said, under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are completely safe from electronic interference can allow their passengers to fly through the plane, while landing the plane and using the device at the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitude, are expected to meet these norms.
Laura Glading, Chairman, Association of Professional Flight Attendant has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be safely implemented - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - it will be a victory for both sides."
When this issue comes, we have been bored to feel like "Hol Monitors".
The agency said that but surfing, exchange of emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no interaction with friends, an online scrable-like game, which is related to the famous incident is that when the actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the park at the door in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American airlines had landed him from the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because their boom will cause the other person to be injured in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Regulatory Rights related to the phone call are with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FA.
During the flight and landing of the aircraft, FAA can remove restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transport Security Board, CBS News, said that the cell phone is still considered as a risk.
Rosenkar said, "Cell phones are really a serious issue, but not because they can potentially interrupt the navigation-related device, but also because they can create obstruction in cell phone towers when they are in the air."
Industry Consultative Committee constituted by FAA to investigate this issue last month has recommended that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the restrictions with their use.
Critics like S. Clair McCasilk, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is universal.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when the passengers had received a report of interruption in navigation and communication equipment due to carrying FM radio and high tech gadgets at that time.
New Airlines Companies are more dependent on the electronic system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic intervention.
Airlines have been proposing use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude from passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interruption.
HURTA said that most airline companies should meet the eligibility norms for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Electronic devices of today emit very less power radio transmissions compared to the previous generation electronic devices.
For instance, e-readers are transmission of absolutely nominal while reversing the page.
But transmissions are strong while downloading or sending data by the device.
Amaon.com is also among those who have taken the side of reducing the restrictions on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew it to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks used by the device.
The Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said that he believes that the interruption from the device is real, even if the risk is of nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot should allow the passengers to shut down the device at the time of landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them the common knowledge of the people traveling in the latest round of technology.
C.E.O. Roger Do of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that the traveler traveling with joy is not inconsistent with passenger, rescue and security.

Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
In April, the Business for Britain was launched and it was pledged to bring together the business and determine what changes we want to see in our relations with the UK's Employment and Prosperity Producer EU.
For this, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked him what he had about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders who are representatives of UK's business size, areas and locations.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of businesses now want to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU members are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, not in the long-term and dry process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views about specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation and product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is much higher than the benefits of becoming a part of the European trading sector - even the vast businessmen who were traditionally favored by European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
Finally, and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move ahead with EU on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are inspiring towards a meaningful transformation which will give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty change for the UK and a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: This survey shows that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect a meaningful change and repeat the current power balance in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming very fast, because Eurozone is stepping forward towards a perspective economy and the fiscal union.
Preference must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey concludes that it means a new focus on business and basic change in the regulation process of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual crimes, Royal Commission hears
Before being charged against Karingbah Child Care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offense.
But in his statement before the Commission, it said that "It never came to light the case of child sexual harassment inside its organization, the commission was told this."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the matter in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA Karingbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual offense against children living in his care in the year 1991.
Mr. Hare from the advocate Gell Fernes, who assisted the commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that the external investigation of the YMCA has been done and they have found YMCA at the forefront in the matter of child safety is not accurate.
It is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified and in August this year, the Department of Education and Community received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the quality audit.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that due to the appointment of Lord, the management including me has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees were clearly aware of their obligations related to informing about child security policy violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted for sexual crimes with 12 children during the two-year tenure of YMCA.
He was punished for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not report the violation of child security by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the violation, gave to the evidence in which Lord spent time alone with the children, getting them privately, sitting in the lap, telling them that he loves them and they play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and had asked for child safety training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that YMCA Karingbah, who supervised the Lord, was very threatening and difficult to get most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not easy to give information above their manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to inform him about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his approach to the YMCA NSW Mandal that "Jonathan Lord was about not giving text information to the organization" from the incident.
Mr. Hare said that immediately after the allegation came to light, the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was made by YMCA's Child Service General Manager Lime Whitele.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the mix of evidence, but it was not excited and executed properly.
Stephen Smallbon, a special professor of child sexual abuse at Grifith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were serious problems in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like the chance to become the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving the post in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair avoided discussions on British politics to a great extent, keeping most of his comments limited to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and representatives of the Middle East Group.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, sure, but there is no possibility of this happening, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horse for the year's best horse in Cardiff, they knew that it would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet went to the school and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his palanquin Tattu Tafi completed three phases very easily and got the top prize - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Roodry near Cardiff, the pair that cannot be separated - which is length - was very much appreciated for the showering, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, she snatched her flat cap on the Alhad angle and made her two-year-old toffee a ring round.
Decisionists praised Fenton for their natural skills to control, which is far beyond his age.
And Tophy got the highest marks for his show and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday in March last year, and he has practiced with this tattu of Shetland daily since then.
His 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a grand couple.
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won gold cups and rosets.
This was the second time only when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy at his victory.
The most different in this colorful land, he felt so wonderful that he wanted to photograph with him.
This younger child of Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wells is walking on the footprints of his anti-Sharon Havels, which has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Havels said, "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating happiness and playing applause.
He was running on the sand in the whole color, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is the crazy of animals - he loves horse, tractor and farm, and he has two chickens whom he cares.
The kind he has started will be in the best horse exhibition of the year very long ago - and I am confident that he will perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his tattoo."
They are very good pairs.
Decisionists gave marks in view of the methods of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he was really very different.
The revival of the Chinese newspaper arguing
A press regulator said that a Chinese newspaper who had made an appeal on the mouthpiece to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, it will be restored.
Guangjau's newspaper New Express gave a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjau.
But after that Mr. Chain admitted on television that he had taken bribe to write a frank news about the partially owned company of the state.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to undergo complete reform.
"The order of reform came from Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration."
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of false news about the listed company Jumalon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that the editorial management of the New Express was unorganized.
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative punishment by canceling the license of Chen Yongjau's reporter.
It had directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, in the New Express, it was recommended to investigate the responsible people and immediately amend the leadership team of the New Express.
Mr. Chain wrote many articles blaming financial irregularities in a Construction-Upgradation Company named Jumloyon in New Express.
After his resistance, his newspaper published two mouthpiece appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chain came to the state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster C.C.T.V. that in this case, I have damaged Jumloyon and the entire news to the Mia industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people.
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After the eradication of Mr. Chain, New Express issued a page forgiveness, in which it failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the TV broadcast defect.
Experts say that from time to time the blame is made, despite this, a law in the latter half of this year banned the officials from binding any person to blame himself.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between USA and Mexico has been found, which has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.

Tax on foreign property owners to end the artificial situation of London
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who presented stamp duty at the rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the budget of 2012, and those who prefer to keep houses in a company instead of a separate person.
In the year 201213, the stamp duty obtained from residential assets in the towns of Westminster and Kensington and Chelesa was 708 million, which is already more than the combined Yoga of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hambur.
After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and introduction of Associated Anti-Evoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the high value property has minimum tax, which is not related to the impact of the old Council tax system.
He added , But this step has made some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and can make the present owners unwilling to sell .
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which is spread from Phulham to Wimbledon, has increased by 11. 8 percent last year as per price in Primary Property, Dhanadya Southwest London.
According to Saviles research, the Central London prices continued to grow regularly by 5. 6 per cent every year, but the growing domestic market seemed to be slightly lower as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.
Scientists have highlighted more on the subject that there is a relationship between the activities of the dog's tail and its mood.
Last researches have shown that happy dogs move their foetus to the right (from the dog), while uneasy dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscient Professor Georgia Wellertigra from the University of Trainto said, "In men, all of them know well that the left and right part of the brain are involved in the excitement in different ways which creates positive or negative sentiments."
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the actions of the left hand and the opposite order in the dogs, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To know more about how dogs respond to one-sided shaking by other dogs, researchers watched animals watching films of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their fate sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We presented dogs with dog films - in the shadow picture to deal with other issues in the realistic version or in confusion, and we could see the movement of the tail and could present the tail more left or right.
When the animals saw an emotional dog shaking his tail on the right side (from the dog) they were completely comfortable.
But when they saw the tail changing the direction mainly to the left (from the dog's eyes), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these activities.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tail on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about the feelings of animals to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Professor John Breadshaw, the guest of the University of Veteranary Sciences, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their head towards the left and see the happy dog turn their head towards the right.
In other research by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "On contrary to the Italian study, when the tail of the robot dog was shaken on the left, instead of being restless, the dogs were more likely to reach it. "
He said that this was because in various studies dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in films.
He clarified that it can help study the way dogs respond to the real dogs.
"When there is a lot of evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still left - and dogs are not exceptions in this case, he said.
However, considering the ease of registering their behavior, it seems that it will not take us much time to understand why their fate sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church consists of supreme grade priests, their posts are below the pope, and these people select the pope, so French will employ the first group of their individuals who will ultimately help in choosing their successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in Pope elections - it comes to the 120 Cardinal Electoral Group.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lambardy said that before the celebration of the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called Pope-Sabha.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell its decision to organize the Pope-Convention of February so that it is easy to plan other meetings with cardinals participation from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that there was a possibility of a decrease in the number of cardinal electors by February.
He said that Pope usually declares the number of cardinal electors less than 120, as cardinals and cardinals with more than 80 years of age according to their wishes.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabha will be important, because this will be the first Pope-Sabha after the French election in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice against Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see whether the new pops nominated cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance."
There are forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by France - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will be the first cardinals to be selected after being formed.
Prior to this, Pope used to decide all things on its own.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that "It is possible that Francis cardinals ask for advice."
But we are not the first in this situation - this is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually Pope gives the post of cardinal to the Bishop of big places, but French people were surprisingly surprised - so we do not know whose name they will declare.
To correct the seatback, GM called back pickup trucks in US
According to an information on behalf of US Auto Security Regulatory Regulators on Friday, General Motors Company, about 19,000 trucks have been called back to correct a reduction in the seatback rotating in its entire new 2014 shaverley silveredo and GMC Sira pickup trucks.
In some trucks, there may be a reduction in the process of turning the front seat.
As a result, the association failed to comply with the auto security standards about the seatback, head restraint.
According to an information put on the website of the National Highway Traffic Security Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
Models to be called back were built between August 1 and September 10.
The GM trucks began to be sent in June and, after the insolvency renewal of the year 2009, it reflects the most important vehicle launch for the top US Automator.
GM had told the truck owners about this fault in the late October.
NSTMA 16-day government captive, which had interrupted the increase in auto sales in October, could not review the notification letter.
GM said on Friday that sales of silverido and sera trucks which were re-designed for the year 2014 model year had an increase of 20 in the first 10 months of this year.

Obama's voters scream of disappointment
I voted Obama twice as compared to change
He says that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of the GOP.
The obstacle policy can not excuse Obamacare website's problems, drone attacks
The memory of the 2008 campaign of Obama reminds me of what could have happened
Nathanial P. Moris Harvard is a second year student at Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think this second year will enhance my zeal during the disappointment of the medical school and will lead to hope rays in me.
It has the courage to win the name, and it is the memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get rid of my patients' prescriptions at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a stage in which politics motivated millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers had stopped to show the historic importance of that time.
My classmates had tears of joy in the eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper.
A team of young visionary people was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During his becoming Obama's President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a remote memories, a tragic memories of lost opportunities.
After the first time I spent voting, there was actual change.
In simple words, none of this could have imagined.
I credit Obama for many achievements, from the Fordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask, till the end of Osama bin Laden was killed."
Besides, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many efforts to move ahead of our country, including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, stopping the base on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But innumerable times in which I took the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues and ended with the answer which I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican's opposition policy is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to the drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the National Security Agency to collect data about the personal life of common American citizens, nor can it answer the prosecution of those who expose the wrong activities of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L Avalaki without any trial, nor the decreasing public funds and expenditure limits during the President Campion.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts to silence the media by the White House have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure of designing a simple website even after three years of signing the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I had expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could denounce the political campaign that brings it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictionary route, because the opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
However, the examples I have given above are mostly elected by the administration.
This thing troubles you most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidature.
Mit Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not appear to determine their policies or their posts.
I felt that another term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's permission rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember their disappearance promises.
In this week, a part of the book was read, describing how Clinton had a huge loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
In a Post-Martum Campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return back to the track, and need to remain integrity on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mozo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from Nathanial Moris.

RBIS suspended two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, this information was received from two people from the case, other indicators that the global investigation by the regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSC Barcles, Dush Bank and RBI, have confirmed that they are collaborating with the regulators in the investigations in the world's largest financial market in which 5. 3 trillion each day is exchanged.
These two traders will be the first employee of the RBIS, who have been suspended with further investigation of the case appearing to be repetition of the Libor Interbank Debt Transaction case.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is going on in this case, and we are fully cooperating with CA and other regulators."
Last month, the distinguished people had said that the RBI has sent the previous trader and sent the records of email and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulator, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader named Richard Yusher had left the RBI in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Head of Forex Spot Trading in J. P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, chief of European Spot Trading in the city, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader in Barclase and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong work.
Knowledgeable people from the case said that Mr. Yusher's quick message group includes bankers of barcles and citgroups.
The BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finma, he is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
At the global level, at least six authority - The Competition Authority of European Commission, Finma, Switzerland, the Department of Justice in VECO, CA, USA and the Hog Paper Monetary Authority - Bankers are investigating allegations of rare fluctuations to make their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
The people familiar with the matter said that the USB, Citygroup, JP Morgan and Credit Suice have also undertaken internal investigations, or have received request for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely investigating quick messages and emails for many years in search of clues of any wrong activity.
Regarding the investigation, the news has created a stir in traders in such a sector, who have been among the leading persons who have earned the highest benefits in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they have to face the challenge this year because due to low fluctuation in the currency, opportunities for speculators have come down.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the huge and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
Senior trader said that despite the overwhelming scale of foreign exchange purchase, the fragment of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by banks means that "You can start affecting the market at a little less ticket price."
This news came on the same day, on the day when Credit Suisse had announced the serving of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
Credit Suice said, "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

Wealth is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Our feeling of money is good.
There can be no more valuable than the money that comes to the welfare of humanity, but the money which becomes the cause of ego does not mean anything.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend it with the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of this should also be a feeling of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collection or yen-can-procession money destroys our discretion, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
A part of the money given by you can also be the basis of someone's life.
Many people in the society are living in a terrible lack, we all should think for them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the masons of life.
All people wish wealth and joy and according to their mentorship, they also get money and joy.
The same wealth and property are sustainable, with which respect is linked.
No matter how rich any criminal can be, he can neither enjoy it properly nor can any other work.
If someone else has money then do not do it.
The true wealthy is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
There can be no other use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not only in the form of money.
It is also in the form of love for your health, character and others.
Try to be the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues the policy to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene at these shops.
In the states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand are included.
Apart from these, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Northeast are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
The first basis is that fast electricity connections are being built in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Petroleum Ministry has made strong preparations about this.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been closed since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg liters.
70 percent of the allocation of Uttarakhand and Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, the news of the shortage of kerosene from these states has not been reported.
The Ministry believes that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of Rs 37.
This encourages those who adulterate.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at the full cost in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.
The accused used to forgery in the name of buying and selling the share by opening the accounts of investors by citing the trade firm.
Perhaps this kind of disclosure for the first time in the state has revealed a cheating of crores of rupees.

This company had bought the server for itself by citing trading on September 24, 2012 in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people are being blamed in the name of investment through this company.
Eight traders of Indore have been present in the Cyber Cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profits, their amount was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started seeking profits from the company's buyers.

The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents used to advise people to join this company by greed for more profits.
After this, two lakhs were deposited from anyone and five lakh rupees were deposited.

Modi said on this occasion, "The coalition government was formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the communist government and sometimes the BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the party do
If the comparative result comes, then the question will not come in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government is formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food for two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man was not lucky to eat.
A single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
Even the media of our country can not reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They do not even answer the media people.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "On the day Modi is being asked questions. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, then every year they will present their work in front of the public.
In democracy, there should be no ruler in Delhi, servants should sit.
There can be no orphan in Delhi only there should be slaves.
Congress friends leave the balloons on the day.
Congress friends, we have given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the people take tests.

Believe in the first president elected independently in Egypt
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in for his post, but his victory day is hardly able to end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On its formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabia has become the first independently elected Islamist President of the world and the fifth President of Egypt after the removal of the monarchy almost 60 years ago.
He sweared in front of 18 judges of the court on his chair, on the banks of the Nil river, which looked like ancient Egypt temple.
During the formal function shown in live broadcast on national television, Morsi said that "We are aspirations for a better future, new Egypt and other Republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal declared organization from the time of its establishment, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, trained in the US of the party, said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of new life - full freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and according to local time, Morsi came to the small convoy of cars shortly after 11 o'clock in the morning.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President separated from the hustle-bustle of the President, the traffic was also stopped for a while so that his motor convoy should come out of the road usually busy, which connects the city's center to its southern suburbs.
After his victory in Morsi's personal prestige, who was ridiculed as Brotherhood's non-Krismai Khali tire, there was a lot of increase and on Friday, his speech presented him not only as Islamist but as the candidate of all who wanted to complete the work of the revolution of 2011 against dictatorship Mubarak.
While wearing blue business suit and red tie, Morsi, while taking oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, said that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing national tunes, while they were standing in the posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantvi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "the army and people are one hand."
Established as the stronghold of secular education in 1908, Cairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist students groups in the years of 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic swearing in Tahrir Square, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the dictatorial rule of Mubarak last year, and the leader removed last year from the military council took oath to withdraw the President's powers snatched from his post.
But instead of accepting the competent oath of Parliament, instead of agreeing to take official oath before the court, they bowed before the desire of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currency.

When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for a counter-attack on Narendra Modi in the Chintan camp.
About his speech, he also said that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled.
There was also the same feeling on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also been told that he was ready for dismissal from the cabinet to keep his point of view.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of fresh thinking in the matter of putting workers on government posts.
State JDU President Vashishtha Narayan Singh had said in the camp that the nomination of workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His sign was also that the list is almost ready.
The news is coming that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also investigate whether the opinion of legislators and MPs has been taken in the list.
If needed, a large scale reshuffle will be made in the list to give place to old and committed workers.
The MLAs and MPs are generally accused that the opinion of those people was not taken in making a list of nominations.
The names of people who came after many other parties have been registered in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people take birth with silver spoon, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
In such persons, a name comes to self-determined Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five siblings.
Five children of the family include Ramnikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumti.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started financially helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to plant a bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached the Aden city of Yemen with a ship named Kabota.
Here, his elder brother Ramniklal had made all arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.
But there was something else in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, they returned to Vatan.
In 1955, with a pocket of 500 rupees, he reached Mumbai to try luck.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani stepped up such a step that he never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like father, today the name of these two brothers is also one of the international businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on PDP ticket from Shopian, was involved in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.

I live in Shopian, called the stronghold of terrorists.
A security team of CRPF at my house was posted under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There is also a bodyguard with me, but all my security on Thursday was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was going from my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.
Of course, in this context, when Kashmir's IGP Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted, he refused to know about the matter and said that this is a sensitive matter.
I will myself investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, then it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at this time, I am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the reign of NDA (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Vajpayee's PM, a round came when for two consecutive years (2001-2002) Patel No advertisement was issued by the government.
Keeping the foundation stone of the 182-meter high 'Statu of Unity' statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "For this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakhs in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on the advertisements of Sardar Patel.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidates do not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Regarding which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crore print advertisements for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tewari was asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, which include the size of advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, whose protesters are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Proceeding through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free healthcare to the rural areas of Cameron
Well and their team see hundreds of patients at almost every weekend .
West African countries do not have much physicians . There is only one physician for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in other top 10 to make C.N. Year hero.
The winner will receive  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father in consciousness and being unconscious, visiting the hospital, which was not properly convenient to assist him.
Jameel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Yonde, Cameron's capital.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his brain, and he created a blood vessel, which influenced his remaining life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron.
If we had money, we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Well continued to roam around very crowded clinics and hospitals about his father and obtained whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy."
You come out of the house at 5 o'clock in the morning that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait and die in the mouth of death.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in the camera.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of the camera can not bear their expenses.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty.
And because of being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm pledge to solve it.
His team of Dr. Georges and volunteers has done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Center Hospital.
And he started the Non-Benefit Organization Escowime, which goes to rural areas at a weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supplies with roofs and go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes the fate is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than one time from rivers and soil and move forward.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: the best house to be presented by the feast, singing and dance, and the community.
Free medical services in these villages are actually a cause of celebration, and Well - with its great smile and uninterrupted energy - with happiness and happiness.
The next morning, their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey."
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weeks clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasite and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a spectacular, donated glasses or free birth certificate - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not spend it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local transplantation.
Operations are usually done at school buildings, town halls or houses, after the process, the patient walks to a recovery place, and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the room with operation and sanitizing equipment, and Well and their volunteers work on Sunday morning and morning.
This is a lot of speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in motivating the team.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes Cameron physicians and foreign medical students, has 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One person said that due to getting free hernia surgery, she will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "This will change the future of my and my family."
Apart from running weekly clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around the yond at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60 of his non-profit work, the rest is completed by personal donation.
A second year medical student of Draxel University in Philadelphia and Volunteer in the group of Well said, "I do not know when they are sleeping."
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medical and nursing like O'Mailly who come from United States and Europe to join the Well Campaign, have this experimental opportunity, which they can never get in their own country.
O'Mailly said, "In the surgery, we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to get experimental experience in them."
You will never get the opportunity to do so as a second year medical student in America.
Volunteers usually spend on their own to reach the camera, and they often come with the medical supply of donation.
But after reaching Yonda, they take the cost of their stay, and the expenses of instructions.
O'Maly says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy while doing this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
See Escowime's website and find out how to help.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You see the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so egoistic that it does not answer the media questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he should answer Modi.
Replying to the public is your duty.
Clearly, Modi was answering Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate in front of him.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, we will present the report before the people every year."

Speaking through video link in the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "It has no question that the President, I and others in the government really knew about some things happening with the automatic pilot, because if you look back, the second world war, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, it had its capacity in 911.
He has become the first high-class member of the US government, who has admitted that US espionage has crossed its border, but has emphasized that no one's rights were misused.
He said that "In some cases, it has gone a lot inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make it clear to the people and is currently undertaking a thorough review so that no person has any sense of misuse.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that NSA was striving for a good purpose and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further said that "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So if you are able to stop it before it happens, what's the problem
We have actually saved the plane from falling, demolition of buildings, and killing people because we have already been able to know about others' plans.
During this time, the chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee of European affairs said on Thursday that the so-called US will go to Europe to help solve concerns abroad about espionage, and European countries will try to explain the need to continue the anti-corruption efforts jointly with the US.
Connector Senator Chris Merfi said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and they are worried about the threats of preventing their participation in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
The Democratic Party was elected for the first time and the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee of European affairs, Merfi said in an interview with Washington, "US is really important for national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our anti-terrorist efforts."
To clarify the European countries that we need to continue work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA programme.
The news of NSA recording millions of Europe's phone talks has brought bitterness in relation to some of the US allies, although the head of the agency said that these reports are not completely correct, and the NATO reflects the misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations assembled by allies.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world including German Chancellor Agenla Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Claiper defended the incident of spying on allies and said that it is common to do so by both sides.
In the midst of the ruckus, Merfi said that his office is arranging for a Congress visit which is likely to be this year, and he expressed hope that the delegation will include members of both parties and both the chambers.
The names of other lawmakers who participate will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the travel program.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "practical relations" have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, their spy programs used for years.
Merfi said, "If we can amend our surveillance program to protect the rights of European people better, but they also need to agree that we are not the only one who is spying. Are there.
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit Middle East and Poland, where he will address the distinction between US strategy and US monitoring activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
New politics has begun to change boards in municipalities.
Recently, due to the change of party of board councilors of Congress leadership in Saithia Municipality of Veerbhum district, the Trinamool has turned into a board.

Shri Rai also claims that under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, all agree with the blueprint for the development of Bengal.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Block are moving forward to join Trinamool Congress.
The qualified leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
Prior to the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of party of Congress councilors in the Saithia municipality, the occupation of Trinamool on the municipal board is being considered as important in political circles.

However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being scared.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress fearing terror.
The CPI (M) is considering the change in the board of elected local bodies as a trauma on democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is necessary to question the justification for changing votes in the item of power.
