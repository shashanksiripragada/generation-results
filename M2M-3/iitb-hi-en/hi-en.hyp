Black box in your car
While America's road planners are battling a shortage of money to improve the highway system, while many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits with cleanliness on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile run by the motor-driver and transmits the information to the officers, is now a matter of controversial efforts for Washington and State Planning Office to revive the old system to financing the major roads of the United States.
Usually, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
You have met the Liberarian Environmental Groups to gather support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes to utilize the tax bills to keep details of the drive mile and possibly driven space.
Tea party is frustrated.
The American Citizen Freedom Union is also very worried about raising various types of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go to such a system in the next decade, in which the driver will pay for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken a black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is actually compulsory for our country.
"This is not the subject of being elected by us or not, it is to say that Hasan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motor drivers in California by 2025.
We are going to change the way tax payments are being made.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has become almost bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by American citizens.
American people do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more miles than before in a gallon gas.
There has been no increase in Federal Tax in the last 20 years, which is 18. 4 cent per gallon.
Due to high value of gas, politicians avoid increasing one money in tax.
Transport Policy expert Lee Munikh at Minesota University says, "Gass tax is not absolutely passionate."
His state has recently installed trekking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In a long time it will work as the most rational option."
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good for urban liberals, because this can lead to changes in taxes to change the mode of driving cars, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are eager for this system, while they are developing strategies to fulfill the target set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favor of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moor, Vice-President of the policy in the region, said, "It is not just a tax that is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for the things they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US Transport Secretaries, who had graceed the Congress to move forward in the direction of payment per mile per mile in their report in 2011.
The US Senate had sanctioned a  90 million test project last year, in which 10,000 cars were included.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing such persons who have to go to work every day or go to the city, the leadership of the House ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It has the most interesting oragon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Newada has already completed the initial test.
New York city is also moving forward in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 coalition, including 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Newada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Newada Transport Department, says, "Big Brother and other similar things were concerns about the main problem."
This is not something that people wanted.
With the advancement of the test, the ACLU of Newada had warned on its website: "It would be quite easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop vast, non-managing technology infrastructure, which must be spread in order to keep every person's daily travel record.
Newada is one of the many states that are making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles of car running every day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, then people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to the small California start-up called Tru Milage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device that it is testing is good for the highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
Ryan Maurison, Chief Executive of Tru Milage, said, "If you do not track the speed and location of the people, they will be more interested in adopting this method.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very low costly and less interference methods to do so.
In Oregon, the planners are using different options to the drivers.
They can choose the device of GPS or without GPS.
Or you can choose not to take any device again, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York City, Transport Officers are trying to develop a taxing device which will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, provide payment insurance according to their drive, and create a collection of real time speed data from other drivers, which Motor-drivers will be able to avoid traffic.
It has been mentioned in the City Planning Document, "Motor-drivers will be attracted for participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment according to miles is a big description.
In the San Francisco Gulf area, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be charged with an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their appropriate share.
Randy Rentcheller, director of the commission's legislative and public affairs, said, "What is the need of radical surgery for the aspirin when it can work."
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of hiding the luggage of the deceased.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other items were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the interrogation that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of late ahid.
Ruhal went to Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the luggage on the edge, while Ruhail went on the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, clock and other items and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has happened due to drowning and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhail has been taken into custody under section 404 to hide the facts and the luggage of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This is disclosed by his family friend Marthel Pollanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisco's Balusconi met when he was a teenage activist in the Forza Italian party.
This is Francisco, whose relationship was being said that his relationship with Balrusconi is just a show.

In the disclosure on Italian radio2, when Pollanco was asked if both of them married, what would happen, Pollanco has said that both of them are already married.
This was not a public function.
This marriage took place in the private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
However, he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to the newborn.
Both of them married about three weeks ago i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, 50-year-old 28-year-old woman was engaged with Francisco Pascal.
To avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi made the basis of loneliness behind his decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued between the sun's eyes and the eyes.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degree Celsius, Gulmarg below zero -0.2 degree Celsius and Leh -1.8 degree Celsius.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, due to rain and snowfall, strategically important Srinagar-Leh National Highway has closed for traffic.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activism of western disturbances, rains started in snow and lower areas in the high mountain areas of the plaintiff, which continued till late evening.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a draconian of children's blood, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram, saying that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media that he was showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to intervene in the matter, saying that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has once rejected Asaram's demand to ban the media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group operator of the mall cut TDS and paid it to the respective financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, TDS's rupee was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai took action with the Jaipur exploration team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago the risk of sealing the account was raided and survey action was taken on the group of this mall operator.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly taking action by targeting them.
Officials investigating in this case have clarified that in case of non-payment, action will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, the demand for sweets increases.
Given this, the sale of poor and fake cattle increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweet and bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake Mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized a spoon of 5 thousand from Mawa and uetta Colony of 70 thousand from Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for poor mava from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The information department got the information about the poor mave kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave consignment from transport garage is being called Nagpur.
The department took possession of this cattle, which was priced at Rs 70 thousand.
Fear of action did not give any right to the claw.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
The chemical named sodium hydrosulphite was used to shine and stay for longer days.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
SS Deshmukh, Co-Chairman of the Department said that the campaign for chemical sweets and poor and counterfeit mava will continue.
In the next few days, the information about this campaign has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause toxic problems.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make sweets from good milk, cattle.
The appeal has been made to the people on behalf of the department to be cautious of fake sweets and cattle.
42 senior leaders of the state BJP received a strong reception at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for a consolation visit organized by the BJP.
Organizing the consolation journey is the exercise of rubbing the families of the people killed in the blasts in Patna on behalf of the BJP.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to make a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people were casualties and there was a panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyr by the BJP.
Party leaders have come out on a journey from Thursday with bone-kalash from their village.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Santvana Yatra is organised as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of those killed in the blasts from seven o'clock in the morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, he will also provide a check of five-five rupees to the families of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
When the Indian team excited by the blasting victory in the last match will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will have to capture the series with victory.
India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to remain in the series after the two consecutive one-day matches were washed due to the rains and its batsmen gave him a record victory while performing a blasting performance, so that the team has equalized 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous forms, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got a salute pair in the form of Rohit and Summit, which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with concrete partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while playing a spectacular partnership in opening.
From the third number Kohli has performed so far, he is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed them better than Sachin.
Virat 17 ODI centuries, which are going to be 25 years next week, India has won in 16.
Following the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were floating badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Belly, have influenced everyone with their performance.
They are also demanding that they be taken to the Test team for the domestic ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to number ninth.
Apart from Beli, Shane Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Fokner have made good bats in the series.
However, File Hunge and Aeron Finch have not left any effect in opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be huge to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed spectacularly in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashage series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this shadow peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel peak to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of the separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even worse.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lt Gen ahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
In such a situation, declaring the demand for abolishing the privileges of the army in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
They give support to anti-national elements.
He emphasized that the statements of the leaders of the army, the security forces should be banned.
Snow Dan ready to collaborate with Germany on US alert
Edward Snow Den, American intelligence informer, has announced that German is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to Parliament if US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to answer their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr. Snow Den Segurwar in Russia, where he was sheltered to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den to the media in Berlin on Friday, "Though the results of my efforts are proven to be positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party-change, and does not provide any rescue which is trying to criminalize political speech with allegations of felony.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to abandon criminal allegations against him.
The allegations filed by the US Department of Justice include theft from the intelligence and the government's property.
Hans Peter Fredrick, Minister of Internal Affairs, Germany, told online Eit: Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure because the NSA has claimed that the Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has bugged.
Thomas Operman, Member of Parliament, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snow Den Kosune had the opportunity to ruin relations with the United States completely and without bringing them into danger, it should also be taken.
Mr. Stro Belle, a Green Party MP, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on his visit to Russia.
Shristro Belene said, according to former NSA contractor lawyer, if he left Russia, Snow Den is not able to go back to Russia.
If Snow Dan testifies in Nezermany, then he will be safe there who will need assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Den said that "He had to face a fearful and sustainable campaign, for which he had to leave the house."
However, he said that by the global comprehensive reactions, happiness and overwhelming is towards his work of political expression.
World citizens as well as high officials, including the United States, have assessed the revelation of an irresponsible system of mass monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to collaborate with the German authorities when the problems of human condition have been resolved .
Rontier Airlines will charge carry - on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge  100 to store luggage on for passengers on their plane board.
In the Rontier Airlines, there is a plan to start a charge for 100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although on Wednesday, its announcement told that the passengers can keep the entire box.
New Carry - On fee is for the bag in overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be charged free.
Rontier said that 25 will charge if paid in advance, 100 will wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Rontier Spokesperson Kate O'Maily said that 100 fees are to be obtained to take care of the charge in advances of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the fees are filling as much as they can do in the carriage - on baggage which is stash in the overhead box, this means that there is often less space in this box.
There's a way to bring down to the passengers on the fee board.
O'Maily said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It's the most loyal customers about Rontier that finding the overhead bin place has become hard faster.
Passengers who buy tickets in their airline website do not have to give this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay  100 for the same bag, while at a frontier gate, a passenger can get a bag free of cost.
O'Maily said that the procedures of Rontier's website and check in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about fees before getting the gate.
Rontier's new carry - on fees, will not start till summers, although a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other fees, but the air services like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those travelers who want service should pay for it.
Many of the baggage fees on Wall Street are seeing as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of deficit.
Most of them don't even touch carry-on bag fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the Carry-on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, the other airline is Hungary's I Air, who said airline adviser J. Sorensen, and who tracks Ed-On-Fees.
He said that Spirit's carry-on fee brings 50 million dollars in a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines official recently flew in Spirit and the passengers had to face carry-on abnormal bag fees at the gate, but expressed surprise.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was easy, he said.
I hoped to grind teeth and see out at a fight gate.
"Aircraft was full and he said it was licketty-split.
Rontier is also following the 2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or spirit for juice.
Rontier said that the passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and give it free coffee only once.
It will still remove the water.
In the US Airways briefly tried to charge for the drinks in 2008, but after the complaint of the passengers, they retreated seven months later and followed after any other main airline was there.
If the passengers of Rontier do not buy directly from the airline, then this move of Rontier to charge the fee on Carry-on is a fresh effort to operate customers towards their own website.
Airlines pay online travel vendor for such 10 to 25 each sold ticket.
This is the reason why all the airlines have been encouraged to operate the passengers to buy them directly instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
Many often in September, flying at a distance of half a mile, for the customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles rantier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows the only passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Rontier website.
There's a loyal base of customers in the city of their home in the Denver of Rontier, but its business is decreasing and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
As part of the sale of the Republic Airlines, they are trying to fix the finance of Rontier.
NSA accused the "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical shortage, our website was closed for a few hours, not due to hackers, as some people claimed online.
Intelligence agency said in an email statement, "Today night NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update."
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS].
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not accessible.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was no "agreement" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hactivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to overloading the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unmatched and the purpose of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was once named "No such agency", has become a matter of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people due to excessive foreign and domestic espionage programmes in the last months, which was collectively distorted by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, secreted NSA files from the agency and after revelation.
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, after the night incident, speculation was made that this incident was the result of a target cyber operation.
Beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, in the fleets, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path.
The drama was inaugurated jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
In the drama, the equity of the Dwapar era of Dronacharya and presently a professor Arvind was shown.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod restless, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a grand presentation while doing full justice with the characters.
In the drama, the light system was designed by the young color worker Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
Subsequently, Aptta awarded various awards to the scholars who made literary, cultural contributions.
It was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and color worker Jitendra C. Raj, Head of Urdu Department of Charan Singh University.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive office bearers in making the event successful.
Bombardier's profits fall as delivery of aircraft, decline in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a decline of 15 percent in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and on contract issues, as under pressure by aircraft order and delivery.
Montrial-based Bombardier also released any flight test data for its brand new "Series" aircraft or its ambitious program to go to commercial service from next September will not present a update on issues.
About half a month before the first flight of the test aircraft, it's just flying three times, the question is whether the test phase is on the track or not.
The outcome fell below the forecast and sent to the share toronto stock exchange for more than 8 for sliding.
Analyst share with Cameron Dorsen, National Bank Financial, had reduced its rating for field performance on Thursday, the stock is limited to the next one or two quarters.
"The powerful aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with margin performance in transport, "Dorsen said in a client note.
We will get a new order for the Bombardier Series as the progress of the flight testing program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be skeptical.

New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we start walking against the rule by keeping the ideal on one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Alex School of Business of UTA.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values without stress in the morning, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right side.
The participants were told that if they gave wrong answers instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
It was seen in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
At the same time, between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found while using people that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their trunks on the trunk.
With this, researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop giving importance to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr. Big was imprisoned by a cocaine lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro
The advocate felt that people could know about his confidential drug addiction .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by the Liverpool Crown Court
To the top defendant's lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid, people will know about his secret addiction of drugs, three years of imprisonment.
After 42-year-old Barashat Ditta compromised due to his cocaine addiction, the infamous criminal Neel Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about investigating his drug smuggling activities.
This advocate, who was named "Bash", and who was praised by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested from his house in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarboro, which he represented in the last Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lankashire, while he went out for Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After getting cocaine particles in Detta's hair, its butterfly, and its credit card, it was found in the investigation that Detta was a regulatory user of drugs of A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarboro and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Burkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after the police seized more than 200,000 pounds of heroine and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds during several impressions.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because he feared that people did not know about his cocaine addiction.
After being found guilty in two cases of disrupting the path of justice after three weeks of trial in Ditta, Liverpool Crown Court, working in the status law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackbandard, today Liverpool was facing a failure in the Crown Court.
He had accepted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started at the time when investigating the scarboro, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping more than 60 percent purity drug under the lawyer's bin in black golf glove.
After the drug was kept, Scarboro was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that when the clues of a category of drugs were found on Ditta's hair, butterfly and credit cards, he was found to be a "regular user of cocaine" in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said that his discussion was "disciplinary privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by removing his buttermilk, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office along with his workplace as well as from his house, and his client used to call his house for legal matters.
After telling the chief persons arrested, what the spy knew about them, the court hearing said that the dettta used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of which he presented the case before.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal advocate should know the best about not breaking the law.
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, adding a lot to his specific client.
We are not talking about the relation of the normal drug dealer, but the dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his boundary of the lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible, he interrupted the investigation of the police so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession but insulting.
He made a lot closer to a certain client, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed an agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that "If I was a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do this immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Helstade said that: At the time Mr. Ditta started obtaining drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself to a criminal advocate.
Due to his cocaine addiction, he entered into a great deal and became very weak to the objectives of the leading members of the Organised Crime Groups, who used it to get important information regarding police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity and fill trust and confidence among the people.
Shri Ditta has betrayed this belief and has tried to avoid his profession.
The Criminal and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and disrupting the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring criminals to court.
This matter should be a warning for criminals that no person is away from the access of law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
After being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis to Scarboro, 14 years of imprisonment was given.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about him, in which he said that his fantasy job would be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, his dinner guest of Mohammad Ali and inequality to be inspired for his work.
Kenya's press angry on disputed media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional and said, "This is a horrific place, and it is valid to ask: What is it to prevent Parliament from snatching the independence of the judiciary in the coming tomorrow
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - which is the most prestigious independent radio station of Kenya and the director of the news website CapitalFM, said, "This law is cruel and very punishable, and we reject it."

Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenyai, describing the media as the main source of control and balance in public life, writes, "No one will ever know."
He wrote, "After leaving the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the hunting and deposit era."
In the past, Kenyai lawmakers have faced the anger of the people.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored about 532,000 Shilling per month, tax-free stringent salary, which is considered among the world's highest.

Ray Namo once initially was a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and the different government of South Africa, as part of the efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Agreement, it became an opposition party.

Our vision is to come back to the agreement, but seriously, Mr. Mazhangane said.

Children should be taught as a model for a way of life writer, myths and legends.
Thor's stories can show there is no fight for all subtle movements in Thakrur power, while the importance of a dream in economic legends is known.
In order to teach many of the myths, it will not be appropriate to teach it in obscene and schools even in the wildlife and even in some cases, Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" from the appropriate tasks of age.
"I think it's surprising, in America, myth and folk songs are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I'm supporting it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers more intellectual  and this is a new turn for children , as well as messages are being presented in entertaining stories .
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated biovalf from Anglo Sexon, along with writing the penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said, "Your intentions can be a lot but it will be better to keep it out of vision."

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of Standup Comedy in America: About a hundred years ago, humorous dramatic Frank Fay, who worked as the master of the function in the Palace Theater in Broadway, started joking directly to the people sitting in the crowd in the manner of dialogue.
The discovery of Fay has expanded over the years, at the New York Comedy Festival.
This festival, composed and operated by Caroline Hirsh, founder of Standup Institute, Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, including more than 60 shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsh says, "Most of these headliners appeared in carrolines, and became very big success, at such a level where they became very big to play in the club.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's programme includes the presence of Venda Cyx, Cathy Griffin and Bill Maihar, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retired persons at Madison Square Garden, Stand-up for Heroes, including Bruce Springstein, John Stuwart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosbi.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come through non-conventional mediums such as Comedi Centre, F. and Spike shows on small networks.
Nick Croll reached the leading place from Deep-Kable Citcom (F. ) funny Fantacy-Football Theme Walk The League, and now he has his own comedy Central Sketch Show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saterday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although he is well known for his viral video series "Marsal the Shell with Shoes on.
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crolls and Slates, are the products of the decentralised world of American comedy (Anthony Jesselanic, satirical, ethnic-centricity-centric) with different voices.
One of the most important attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg's talk to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a standup comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
This meeting will be held at the Town Hall at the centre of Manhattan.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all the works of Larry."
They were telling me that when they are here, sometimes they go to the street between two buildings and used to think in themselves that if I ever lost my entire money then I will stay here.
Oil  96 per barrel continued to decline

Court has blocked action on the cease-fire and sports policy of New York Police Department
On Thursday, a federal appeal court required a judge's order for the cease-fire and sports program of the New York Police Department, blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court Appeal 2 and Judge Shira Shindeler has said that the judge's decisions will be pending on the result of an appeal by the city.
In the Judge Nagar, it was ruled out in August in violation of the Constitution in the way it prevented people and excluded from their program of questioning.
The City Police Department has also decided to allocate a surveillance to help in the transformation of its policy and related training programmes, its findings and its curative orders.
The appeal court heard arguments on Tuesday on request migration.
The appeal court has said that because it made a necessary agreement for a judge to avoid the presence of a bias in part of a series of media interviews and by the public, different from the code of conduct for the American judges, hence the judge should be removed from the case, to criticize the court of statements, publicly accountable should go.
The judge had ruled that the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and sports program.
He has appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and closes the most, where in some premises, a pilot program has been ordered to test the body-worn cameras.
In August, New York City, whose cases were rejected after a police stop, agreed to end the practice of collecting names and addresses.
A verbal argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
The cease-fire and sports device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The cease-fire and sports policy has somehow been around decades, but most of the black and Hispanic men have been recorded to prevent dramatic growth under the administration of Independent Mayor Michael Blueberg to raise all the time from 684330 to 2011.
A case was filed by four men by all minorities in 2004 and became a case of class action.
Supporter of the change in the NP's cease-fire and sports program has said that unfair behavior will end, another more reliable and effective police force will have to be carried out and other police departments can affect the use of the policy.
The opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, money waste and not during the last decade, thousands of officers will solve a comprehensive problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking.
The judge has noted that the cease-fire and sports had not ended, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the NP's stop.
In the training, participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts joined a large number.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were informed about many students including tent pitching, flag poles.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are scattering the spirit of unity by joining the Sarvadharma prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar is giving special support to the State Training Commissioner.
Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Callson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his crucial relations while being the Home Secretary of Charles Clark.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis .C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clark is meeting with his "Active Special Adviser Hannah Paulby."
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Machester to hack the poly's voicemail and keep that male watcher, but Callson called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Adis said that "The campaign party suggests that Mr. Callson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, but they keep articles in front of the people, see what people react to it. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to examine cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third person himself was involved in the editor.
It is obvious that he knew about the other ways i.e. Nigarni, he definitely knew.
What about the first one
Did he know about phone hacking
He says, no, we say that "yes, he knew absolutely."
Rumors about Clark's circumstantial relations were presented for the first time by the Feature Desk of AOTW, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Paulbi said: "Do not waste your time, she is with Charles."
In August 2006, the tape of wisemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Paulbi's phone from Malaysiaar.
The investigators also found such entries in the private investigator's computer on which Ms. Paulby and his sister were named Project.
During the period he was being investigated, anonymity was called to Ms. Paulbi's grandfather and asked for information about him.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Navily Thurlbek and former reporter James Weatherup witnessed the surveillance of Ms.
On June 18, 2005, through a wisemail, Callson told him: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Adis said that the inclusion of callson in this case is only in the pattern of other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The Justice Court heard on Thursday that Callson talked to Mr. Blanket about Pranaya relations with a married woman, while at that time she was watching the case of co-responsive Rebekha Brux, who was married at that time.
Callson and Brooks refused to intervene with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.

Late on a calm day in August, a German police helicopter took over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Office (B) to protect the Constitution, the mission of Germany's domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the US post, which is located at a distance of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Wendisbank.
The German media asked CB to express hope to identify Lysening Antenna's presence and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
The director of the American National Intelligence, James Clapper, insisted that the United States would use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and to increase their international competitiveness or enhance the line below them in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made a Whistleblower, started telling the treasure of his secrets to the American surveillance, the leaders of the European governments and the business world are no longer sure that the director should follow his promise or not.
The American National Security Agency spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, feared the state surveillance .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel ' s phone was bugged , possibly a decade ago .
If Europe's most powerful persons can be targeted, then definitely the leaders of the business world are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit .
"Germany should wake up, Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the United States has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes, to steal industrial espionage and data.
In all the documents, there is no evidence that Mr. Snowden leaked, however, that the United States has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for his companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union and must strive to reduce their dependence on the United States .
The leaders of the business world are doubting about this.
In the German Parliament, someone said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, chairman of German Trade Software Company SAP, said, "This is not a way.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then it did not allow him to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal, cars, farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations highlighted by Snowden about US technical refinement and espionage access have proved to be a trauma for some companies who first believed that China is the biggest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the Cloud computing field where European officials are more aware that the stored data in the United States is under the jurisdiction and therefore become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey excluded by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use a US-based cloud provider after the disclosure about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-Chief Executive Officer of SAP says, "We saw a new question that did not come to the customers a year ago - Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will be in that jurisdiction physically
Many German officials argue that the latest report was just confirming whether they were already aware: that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore they should be guarded at every cost.
It's not a surprise that there is economic espionage.
It has always happened.
"This is a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing changed is called Curt Bock, Chief Executive of Chemical Producer BASE.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, the message has been recorded for a long time, whether it is uncomfortable to leave one in the business from home to home, taking usb sticks, or leaving a laptop in a hotel room, it is uncomfortable to say at least.
Members of the board of Lrich Hackenberg, Car Manufacturer Audi, say, "It is a year old system to collect mobile phones before the board meetings because they can not be used as remote listening tools.
Germany's CBE executive, while smart phones are compromised due to risk on foreign tours, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, many of these companies are the top in the global market in special place.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate mystery effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access."
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of their own companies.
According to the French the Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February is nominated in another tier of criminals engaged in hacking for economic information behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German Blue Chip Company, when the matter comes to make financial espionage, France is the worst
In the interview, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency URI, Bernard Suarsini explains: "Services well know that even though all the countries cooperate in non-terrorist battle, they spy on their colleagues.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we also do , because it is in national interest to protect our business .
No fool made.
"Georgia's teenage parents, who were killed in an accident, believe that his son was killed.
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in the resting mat in his high school gym, believes that his son was killed, the family advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA's Kendrick Johnson was found trapped in a straight mattle standing behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
The investigators of Lands County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was killed in a "untouchable accident, but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Serup, who presented Kenneth and Jackleen Johnson, told Fox News.com that he fully believes that his son has been killed.
They do not believe in death in the way sheriff has said.
Sorp said that "He believes that this thing is beyond the argument of physical rules and normal intelligence."
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the protection of the person responsible for the death of his son or people.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag
US Advocate General Michael Mulare said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions are answered.
What was the reason for death
Did he kill him due to any crime
Mure said this in a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will comply with the facts, they will take us anywhere.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the fore.
He said that "I think environmental reasons are present for a formal investigation."
Mure told the reporter that initial body tests indicate that Johnson died as a result of a conditional respiratory respiratory.
According to Mure, in the second body test, there was a different reason for death.
He said that "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Mure also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not available immediately for comment from the London County Sheriff's office.
On Wednesday, the judge of Southern Georgia ordered the officials to issue all the monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that video footage will give some indications how his death took place.
CDC releases Allergy Guidelines for Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling food allergy of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the US Government as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now in the US, one of the 20 children has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergy cases in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, it has been informed for schools how to inform teachers and employees about food allergy of children, and how to handle them in case of any allergic reaction.
It has also been suggested to the schools to keep Apinefrien's stock to face potentially deadly anaphilexis - which is the auto-injector of APPAN brand, which is commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in more quantity.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It seems that something is stinging in my tongue, "It seems that my tongue has hair, or "My tongue is swinging."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose the sex of their children undefined
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has recognized the third gender for children born with vague genitals.
Now newborn children will not be specified in a conventional manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "indefined or "indefinite" on the birth certificate of the child.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can take quick decisions related to gender specification surgery for newborn children and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said after years, "No, I am a man, nor a woman."
I will remain a wounded, stained band made by doctors.
According to estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the scrutiny of gender development disorders, is a collective word used for abnormal chromosome, genitals, or abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Valis Sympson is intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-determination can not be done, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and inspect the psychological and physical development of the child before this is done.
Dr. Jack Dresher, psychologist of New York City, who is an expert in gender-information affairs, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good thing."
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a situation like life-strick, for which surgery is needed, but this does not happen with most children.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No person can give a proper answer about this why this happens.
It is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described differently from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to sex, but it is related to its biological creation, which is neither clearly male or female, but either jointly or both of them are not clearly defined.
These features can showcase themselves secondary gender characteristics such as weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breasts and length primary gender characteristics such as reproductive organs and chromosome structures and hormones.
The report provides a sympathetic view of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-existent gender.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark men, women or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry Me-Welby became the world's first recognised sexless person after winning the legal appeal to keep life-long sex status.
According to the Internal Ministry, in addition to M or F in German passport, there will also be third specification as  for intersex persons.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed the petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going to such a state where gender is the choice of itself, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn baby also told the baby one that she would like to see the children being specified sex at birth.
He said on the website about upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without extra boundaries, especially if you do not even know what is the gender of your child."
Children need stability and surety.
Historically, children born with both men and women's genitals were called Hermaphrodytes (Ubellingi), which was in the name of beautiful Greek God, who was biling.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered the gender as a slat which could be eradicated and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender-faculty is a complex task, and sometimes there can be a mistake from doctors who do not know what to feel about their gender specification when children grow up.
The dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Manorog Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgery.
The present theory of treatment of children with vague reproductive organs was presented by Dr. John Money, University of John Hapkins, who regarded gender as golden.
He composed the word gender identity and argued how social and environmental signs - parents upbring the child - interact with the child's genes and hormones and determine that it should be identified as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as Johnjoan, their principles became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex was accidentally sex during the sex sex sex sex sex sex sex, that they should completely bind the child and expel her feed and raise her like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mini presented that case as a successful case of conversion, but it did not happen.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following the "His copy".
But in the years after the year 1990, with the arrival of the Internet, the persons passing through these gender surgery started coming out, "No happy with the result."
The same case was with 36-year-old writer of Montana, Jim Bruce, who was born with Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors did not understand clearly that his gender was small, or his Bhagshef was big, but they were sure that he could never live "content life" as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, the external organ of the bruce and the ovary were removed by surgery and she was raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I am not a girl.
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was about to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the horrific truth.
At the time of birth, I was bound up - and no one told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making testosterone in sufficient quantity, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, he took the dose of testosterone and removed his breasts.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to people about intersex persons in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
However, the executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, Ani Tamar-Mattis expresses concern that the law of Germany invites "Chippy and Stigma".
They say, "A lot of activists think that the law of Germany will inspire parents to make quick decisions and specify the child "indefinite".
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We think it is a better process to specify male or female sex rather than waiting.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to be identified in the third gender.
He said, "Adults should be able to make their own decision about legal gender."
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erleen Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the law of Germany will provide "empowerment" to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Kati was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD named full endrogen insensitivity symptoms.
Since there was a defect in her Androgen eclipse, the female characteristics were developed in Kati.
There is vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now the 29-year-old Kati is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Although he is barren, he expects to become a mother through adoption or guest surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make any decision in haste.
It provides them understanding and time properly by some tests before writing a man or a woman.
In this way, you are fine - upbring the child, love the child.
You have a beloved child and enjoy him.
We do not need to get such surgery done in haste, which can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the process of taking decisions and frees parents from the evil that motivates parents because they do not believe that they are doing well."
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

In which students and others were given information about the right to education and law for economically backward people.

A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers of President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton instead of Biden for the Vice Presidential post for 2012.
The most remarkable explosion in the revelation is that heavy anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Duble Down: Sports Change 2012 by Mark Halperine and John Helemon.
Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and told Thursday evening that the top advisers of the President could help in Obama's declining hope of re-election to know the 'Vyapak Group-Summits' and Polling held in late 2011.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book tells the full information that the Chief Officers tried in the campaign and put the head bills of the former White House staff for the name, to know that the former state secretary Clinton's Vice President's change on the poll.
Possible switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and within the Oval Office .
With only half a dozen close advisers of the President, the changes of former Obama campaign chief Jim Macina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerade and David Palauffe were under consideration.
Double Down claims that Delle tried to change Biden , in spite of his personal coordination , ultimately before taking a decision , when he told him that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I said keeping the whole scene in view, and one of them, this was Dale told the newspaper."
You remember, when the presidential post was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation, "What else will we do"
While Dale told the research as a caution, Martin had told END's Enderson Cooper that the election campaign again invested significantly in finding out how much profit will this claim be given to the pole.
 Campaign does not spend on voting and focused groups like money until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
This is obvious, however, Obama knew that his team was looking for changes.
Martin told CNN that he asked him if his boss knew about possible reshuffle
While Dale said that he did not think the President knew about possible changes , the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew it .
"Double Down" will definitely not answer whether Obama's desk reached the political investigation, Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know about Biden dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.
Glo-in-The-Dark ice cream likes
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream-jellifish use.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of the maritime animal to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came to him after reading a research paper on gelfish and China's reliable scientists used the chemical shine to shine the protein again.
The ice cream, the eater will react with the tongue and increase the PH level of protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream is burnt with reactivity from the heat of the mouth, that is, it will be more bright to win.
Charlie, founder of Like Me IM Delicius Icecream Company, said, "This is an incredible thing but the production of early days will get about 200 grams of goods from me.
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral PH in tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will shine.
We ' ve been examining for the past few months and it looks absolutely right to share it on helovine because it gives a wonderful shine effect
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream that has been manufactured because the glimpse of gelfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So every scoop costs me around 140 pounds .
However, Iska taste is very good.
Capne is famous for abnormal taste, including experimental company, beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves based in Charlie's Bristle.
But his next composition is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
This is naturally impossible due to ice crystal, which makes a change over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a reflected qualities of a gelfish which is synthesized by Chinese scientists

For this reason, there is also a jam in other markets including the outer ring road.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach the house.

George Careven : Euro dissolution gave option to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of EU membership, independent Scotland will be required to join the entire Europe as an independent travel territory.
Passport control on Barwick and indicate stories about the blanket wire limit on the walls of the Hadrian.
It is true that the Stratchlide Paper describes the potential economic benefits of independent traffic with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in the Headlines forecast.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shingen region, therefore, Brussels will actually be cheaper for continuous non-compliance Brussels instead of getting whatever it wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has been frozen. First of all, I mean "Independence" means passport control baseless news about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point lost in renaissing this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should you expect Europe's bidding from independent Scotland
Why London's Yok should be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now
Here is the real European news: The great plan to organize Europe, the post-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated teams are getting strength to oppose the EU in the entire EU or to close the Euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscoptil Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came to get about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections in September, and thus free democrats (equivalent to our lib dems) effectively excluded from the Bundestag.
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be radically transformative.
With the stringent rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency, many people have to think that project Europe has gone far away.
There was no very much role in the Euro crisis in the high budget deficit of national governments - it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the prospect of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent damage to productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure which has been encouraged by Berlin.
More than the current budget and currency problems, there is a deep European productivity illness.
As a result of the green energy policies imposed by Brussels to provide relaxation to French and German energy firms on consumers expenditure, the European industry doubles power and four times for gas as compared to the United Nations.
This is a paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even to free all the wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry can not be saved from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a sense of revolt among the people, especially in France, who was once the chief admirer of the EU.
After the war, top French politicians had seen the EU as a means to control Germany and to provide billing to Paris equal to Washington in the world.
But Berlin does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is stagnating.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing, the anti-EU National Front, has won the victory by pushing the ruling socialist to the third place in the recent by-election.
At present, the front is the most popular party with 24 percent of the votes in France - it is a timely warning for the British Labor that they can not follow that dissolution for the left, will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his new fame between French whites, working class
The team wants to use the EU elections to be held next year to create an anti-EU, anti-monetary group in the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, in these elections, anti-EU parties perform well, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My approach is: Soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will end the Euro.
Euro will not end completely, but it will be back to Footkar (Supreme) countries in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gall.
Germany and some of its following economies can maintain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will resume their currency.
I hope UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of enhancing close proximity with the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect ourselves' economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-unional countries to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic independence while walking on the path of Norway.
The SNP Government in Scotland has been the most successful anti-economic political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tori-Lib Dam alliance proposed by Labor Chancellor Elistair Darling.
It will be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it will have to accept the rules of financing imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth before time: Grow early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get younger in comparison to female girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a cause of youth at young age
Premature youth case is not as effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheriz is a specialist journalist in health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8
At the annual conference of the American Child Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric and pediatrician, explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, they show a new trend.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time to give parents this assurance - that it usually does not show rapid progress in the direction of full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as breast germination, genitals and scalp hair and physical smells are seen before time in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of menstruation (first menstruation).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
When breasts start developing then first menopause takes at least two to three years, Caplovitz explains, which is also the author of the girls ' premature youth: the necessary guide to deal with this common problem.
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of youth, but when there is an increase in breast development before the age of 8 years, two are called "Bal-Adult".
In most cases, this process will slow or stop - which the child doctor can closely inspect.
In the event of more rapid progress, there may be a need to be checked by an endocrinologist so that the prospects of serious problems like tumors or cyst can be overcome.
There are treatments for delaying premature menstruation and other consequences: premature age-growth of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and drama as adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on child age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adult.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of medicines but accepts, "Suppressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can start feeling different from their companions."
The second big problem can be understood: Parents do not want their younger daughter to have menstruation.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally ready.
She was scared of her school and returned troubled that in her friends, she started the first menstruation.
There are many popular principles about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no constant evidence that hormones in milk or other food items, chemicals in the environment or sexually oriented messages in the media can be charged.
boys are also getting premature youth like girls.
Caplovitz determines the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct studies on girls of 6 to 9 years, which connects the fat of the body with the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get youth before their age girls.
There are many clarifications about this.
At the global level, the pattern of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzles: although boys are getting faces and genital hair at a young age, but the practice of youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians attending the AAP Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it is common to see pimples and genital hair.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child physician endocrinologist at Goryb Children's Hospital in Moristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the actual start of youth.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean to negotiate before the expected time."
If you are calm then your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Big orders of jet manufacturers at stake from dispute for seat width .
This month, there is a competition for the fight for Dubai Aisho, among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights.
The dispute is focused on the width of the economy class seat in long flights, not always like being given by airlines, but whose allotted location has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be the key.
Erbus has expected such industry standard to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- cm -RRB- in the economy cabin this week but it should be decided by airlines its chief opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when after the incident of 17-21, there was a competition to sell the big version of the twin engine of long distance aircraft from the possible recorded order.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - especially if the seating is 9 or 10 is equal to the same, keeping in view the claims of more capacity, designs of mini jumbo jets are being prepared
Boeing says it has been made 777  which will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 people in one line in an anonymous department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people to the seat left in 18 inches.
Air veterans often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press .
Now, with Airbus 777, Dubai is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Airho, it is further appealing to the public.
It is being seen recently that the beginning of the Vigyan war has been anything, showing this to Finsero, will you accept it together at the three restaurants together
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said, "The Boeing Regional Turbo is also presenting a long distance flight in narrow seats."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit on the plane has not changed.
According to the American Health Department data, between the 1970s, when Boeing 747 Jambo ne defined the modern long-term ki yatra co, and the age of the century, the average 40-49-year-old American male weight increased by me 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is stuck with a seat concept of 1950 when the new name was an average periphery of jet set narrow .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission which suggests improvement in the quality of 53 per cent of sleep in an additional inch in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the airbus seat measurement data , and said it is not dependent on the manufacturers ' decisions how the airlines are balancing between rent and facilities .
It also says that research shows that more than one seat width depends on the experience of cabins.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver has said that . This actually tells in providing flexibility to the airlines and those things which believe that what is the need to do to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they have benefit from.
They know better about their business than someone else.
It is about the elbow room for the flyers, but for the suppliers it is a fast issue that it can affect the income.
Behind this dispute, the trade of at least  700 billion is estimated that the aircraft order competition is sufficient in the coming decades to tip the scale of American and European exports.
The Reuters report said that for the first time in July, what is the seat layout actually a fight between new jet aircraft
Airbus and Boeing claimed that per seat has been 20 percent efficient, in their new twin engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 AR.
The claim of Boeing ' s performance depends upon a comparison of 777 x one original 9 with 777 designs .
With the benefit of the unit cost, the comparison has now been utilized.
The head of the Airbus Passenger Facilitation of Cavin Keniston, Europe, says, "Boing's aircraft is doing this to capture more seats to make our products more competitive with our products."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-related cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the denser layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Internal Expert Mary Karbi, Founder and Editor's runway girl network said that the width of eighteen inches will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of 777
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for the airlines.
Jet vendors around the world also take careful measures to check on this layout competition.
While resting, all builders are also giving high density layouts for low cost aircraft services and regional travel.
Airbus giving a 10 equal to A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But as far as recently, Airbus insisted on comprehensive cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft to need more cabin facility.
Modern jet aircraft are not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distract from 777  sale wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can finish the joy of smoking .
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate fun from smoking.
The only dose of vaccine was capable of keeping the rats safe from the addiction of nicotine for the whole life.
There is a need for further tests before the human test is started, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Cristal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods present in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods."
There is a harmless virus in the new vaccine, which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus infects the select liver cell, which after that starts creating a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents smoking from supplies of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats which were later given nicotine, continued to do their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat which was not given vaccine, it was "good", it was an indication that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver cell will make the antibody factory.
Professor Christal said that if the human vaccine of the future is completely safe then it can be given to the children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But possibly it will be used by smoking people to leave smoking.
He said that "He will know that if he starts smoking again, he will not get any joy from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in getting rid of his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual reason for the death of the tiger.
The Forest Department is giving a round-the-clock answer to the death of the tiger in the first sight.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division found a body of a tiger near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
With all the parts of the body of the tiger being safe, there were no marks of wound or injury etc. on it.
In the presence of forest guard Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Nasim, SDO GS Karki, in the presence of CTR veterinary Bharat and Kotabagh's veterinary doctor Hema Rathore, the post-mortem of the body of the tiger was done.
According to sources, during the post-mortem, the internal body of the tiger is being reported to be bad.
This did not find the reasons for the actual death of the tiger.
Departmental officials continued to respond to the death of the tiger.
Yet the internal organs of the tiger have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topsychological examination to confirm the poison.
Forest Guard Western Division Vivek Pandey said that the death of tigers can be said naturally.
There are no symptoms of poison etc. from the body of the tiger.
Yet, with the search of the surrounding area for this, the Bisra investigation is being sent to confirm the poison.
Refusal to be affected by Tripodi Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Cropson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to deny the policy of maritime lease on the request of his political guru AD Obide, the patron of former New South Wales, AD Obide, whose government-controlled three lands had hidden interests.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICA) on Friday detailed the investigation, whether Mr. Obid has violated the circulars of the policy of lobbying with several State Ministers Where two restaurants and cafe owned by Obid, without tender Renewed in August 2005 after its expiry.
Lin Ashpole, after the evidence given by former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, knew the hidden interests of Shri Tripodi Shri Obid of the charge that is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized the launch of public tender for lease.
The leaseholders were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprise for lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, was renewed without lease tender.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Shri Tripodi urges change in government lease policy .
Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Don, a senior official who came to the Department of Fisheries of Mr. Obid after working in the Ministry of Port.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healthy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Did the commercial lease policy be discussed in the telephone conversation of the development case,
"No, Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what I had discussed, but it was definitely not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say that Israeli fighter planes attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter aircraft targeted Latakia, the port city of Syria on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.

Foreign employees can pass through "Authenticity Test" on 457 visas
A "Authenticity Test" is being considered by the government for foreign employees on 457 visas as it aims to expand a harsh action.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a criteria framed for the purpose of filling up unskilled posts in Australia or preventing 457 used to be used to deliver to the family and friends in a distinct manner.
Today, a government discussion letter was released, condemning the government's terminology about foreign employees, former Labor MP Maxine Macquo today said that it can make Australia's neighbouring countries angry.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "Strong rhetoric about the job before to Australian people is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when the unions have demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security and if some people in the region have seen the sound of that historical evidence, I would not be surprised.
In the discussion letter, 12 measures have been outlined, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Okonner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about smuggling people, has implemented five recommendation changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity Criteria" is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the owner of the visa sponsored person or the relevant person is related or personal partner.
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees kept hundreds of people working.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee refugee died due to suspicious heart attack after coming to a refugee boat on Christmas Iceland this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins tied up, which was on the same vessel.
Australian officials transported the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Works by CS2 indicate high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that this project will make Britain one.
Scotland Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
In the first phase, the new High Speed Rail Line will be included between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed link between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland transport, directed the US2 Limited to consider the possibility of improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgo and Edinburg to London for three hours or less.
According to the Barrones Creamer: Our goal for CS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving forward with CS2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glasgo and Edinburg, which will be well connected due to the US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistair Carmical, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Keeth Brown appealed to Mr. Karmikel to make a clear return to Scotland in the FS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The High Speed Rail is likely to have huge economic benefits to Scotland, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire case of high speed rail in the entire UK.
Therefore, we are excited to work in the participation of the British Government so that we can examine the options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and fulfilling the Glasgo-Adinburg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to reviewing the inquiry report with the ministers of the British Government next year and taking decisions together on further action.
Aircraft Electricity Equipment Rules will now be effective in Australia
In spite of the move to soften in equipment regulations in the US, Australian airplane passengers will have to continue to stop their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the American Air Services companies open options to change their procedures, so that travelers will be able to read e-books, watch video or play games on their equipment during the important phases of the flight, provided they remain in the equipment "Avian mode".
Passengers can do this during a lot of flights, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and reach their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian Air Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which the US Air Services companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but emphasized that the ban on the use of power equipment in the important phases of the flight in Australia is still effective.
Currently, CASA has no specific regulation that controls the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the Authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which Air Services Operations Companies have to ensure that the security system is always completely maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the security instructions given by the crew members.
Virgin, who is already talking to LASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the instructions of the regulator.
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by LASA in the matter of allowing the use of electric equipment, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) Our planes are in. "
uantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
It said, "According to our current policy, electricity equipment can not be used during flying and landing, and we do not have any immediate plan to change it."
CDAA decisions apply to American airlines.
Well, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions and reasons behind the CAAA.
The effect of this decision will be different on each US Air Service Company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Air Service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio disposal from mobile devices, as well as amend their rules books, training materials, carriage-on baggage programmes and brief details to the passengers.
LDAF said that after the verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, he will allow the passengers to use all the heights, light weight electric equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In rare cases of less visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to close their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in upper coaches while flying and landing.
Panbrokers silver due to difficulty felt by middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying her gold bangles, rings and sneezing to pay her daughter's school fees at Panshop in Bendemier Shopping Center in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is trapped in it."
She says that although she earns  3,000 Singapore dollars (US 2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, but the monthly income of the family is inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic credit is increasing - Valumax, where they are doing their own transactions, this week Singapore became the third ponshop to be listed on stock exchanges.
Pledge of ornaments is not the only way to get cash - in case of Ms. Amirthalinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsafe bank loans are cheaper.
Generally, Panbrokers in Singapore take 17 per cent per year interest, which is a little more than 15.4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local lender, whose branch is in the same shopping center.
However, the ponbrokers have the benefit of examining the credit or not required the amount of salaries, and can provide loans more faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning to Panshop due to the increasing costs of living by families and the increase in domestic and consumer loans.
Due to strong growth for five years after the global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to simplified monetary policy in the developed economies, the low and medium income families are turning to a ponshop to meet their requirements due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards Ange Purse, mainly due to the growing mortgage, described the growing domestic profit as a risk factor for Asian banks' borrowing.
It said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic credit in the ratio of GDP.
Malaysia is at the highest position in the list with 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a reduction in continuous export slowdown and consumer demand.
Economist Song Seng Wun said in the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, "The decisive point is that with increasing prices, people coming from middle to lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way."
In the last two years, the historically high values of gold have inspired people to mortgage individual property as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the jewellery of their family.
70 percent of the items mortgaged in 200 pon outlets of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's pledge the gold chain of the grandmother's mother, and will withdraw next month."
The largest Panshop operator of Thailand, EGMNI, has seen a 20 increase in the number of customers using their outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the mortgage business that the Outlet operator Valumax in Bendimer and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia are planning to expand, Valumax executive director Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount landerers (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that mortgage is not only cheaper than other lenders, but it does not directly increase the loan.
They say, consumers mortgage such items that they already have, and redeeming personal assets does not increase domestic credit.
Social acceptance of Panbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only the financially weak people use Panbrokers.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use valuemax outlets, they mortgage gold bars or rollex watches, which can get up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
Ms. Yah says, "Including wealthy persons who need a loan for a short time for commercial enterprise or investment, or small businesses which need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in just a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
To participate in this party, many big stars of Bollywood reached Jodhpur, on the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife poetry Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously, when such big names are included in the party, you can guess how big it will be.
Rescue package of  325 million for Taji's health
The Union Government has stressed that for the sick health system of Tasmania, there are  325 million rescue packages, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the Commonwealth, Island is taking immediate action to resolve the current crisis due to the growing population of the state, high rate of chronic diseases, and limitations of the system.
The decision to financing during four years was taken after the consultation of the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilki.
Ms. Plibersek said, "Government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe that it will solve the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving previous accumulated cases.
It also includes walk-in clinics in Hobert and Lawnsestation, better care after going from the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health recording system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plibersek said, "This investment is in accordance with the best ways given to me to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading doctors.
The Minister emphasized that Tasmania's government will face strict reporting and accountability rule.
The State has to maintain the current financing level to obtain Commonwealth Funds and report every month where additional funds are being spent.
A Commission of three Members will be constituted to ensure that the State provides services in an effective and efficient manner as possible.
Mr. Wilky said that 325 million dollars would not mean too much, unless Tasmania's public health system is further sensible, real reforms should not be made.
However, he praised the government for reacting to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the federal assistance package will prove to be very helpful in separating the state-run public health system from a crisis-hit list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will mainly expedite the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "Band-Ed solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here for this reason because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system."
You can not consider the taking of about half a billion dollars by the state government and giving  300 million by the Commonwealth as a good news day.
Shri Dutton demanded that Ms. Pliberseck should guarantee that none of the rescue packages would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build its chemical weapon
On Thursday, the monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to make chemical weapons and poisonous gas war material, while in the northern part of Syria, a fierce struggle emerged, which is very close to that place where toxic agents are considered to be kept.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Syria's civil war that started about three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapon Prohibition Organization took place a day before the last date of 1st November .
Which was determined by the Hague-based organization to destroy the machinery used to mix chemicals in all the chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to make it "effective" to fill the war material.
Mainly the completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development, aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus has to destroy the weapons and collections present still.
It is believed that Syria has just 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, which includes mastered gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK situation Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a chemical weapon production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which has details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this 61,067 common citizens including 6,365 children are included.
On behalf of the government, it has been said that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah is militant.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing struggle since March 2011.
It has not updated data since then.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military team continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people have been casualties on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in a very short span of time.
The statement on OPCW, who worked together with the United Nations, said that its team is now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all the declared important production and mixing equipment in Syria - destroyed.
It also said, "There is no plan for any further inspection activity.
Earlier this week, inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 out of 23 Centres announced by Dumscus.
The inspectors said that they were not able to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the entire destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
In a comment issued by OPCW, Director General of the Group, Ambat Ujumku said, "I salute the determination and enthusiasm shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization so far."
This civil war, which has been running for three years, is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, in which Shia came out of Islam, besides members of It cult, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, observatory chief Rami Abdur Rahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the Air Defense Center in Latakia, the coastal region of Syria.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not known yet.
Police have recovered photographs of fake registry, fake seals, laptops and fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar located in Haboval, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused registrar, along with the clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh of the office, used to get out of the records of empty and old lands and after that buy new stamp papers and prepare forged registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, they used to offer fake registry records.
After this, the accused used to sell land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these fake papers used to take loans.
After this, the real owner of the land used to be pushing the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told in the interrogation that they have prepared forged registries about 150 so far.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft are registered before the gangster Rajiv.
Anger on the conviction of plotting bomb blast in Bali
In the year 2002, the families and relatives of 202 people killed in the bomb blast, expressed their displeasure over the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast, saying that Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building an explosive device used in the bomb blast.
If parole is given, he can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty in many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded life imprisonment, although they could also demand that this person, who was called the infamous "devastating person" in the form of a bomb maker, was the death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the women living in Partha June Cortein, who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stoping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "He should be placed in front of the firing team.
I have to live without my grandson and my daughters every day.
On October 12, 2002, immediately after 11 o'clock in the night, after the explosion of the bomb loaded in the van outside the whole club, the nomination of this club was erased.
Peter Huges, the bagpack filled with explosive materials by suicide bombers was in the padies bar just 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, they went to a month-long coma and died three times during living on life-saving equipment.
Shri Huges says that Patek should have been punished, who had received three other members of the Jammah Islamiah terrorist group responsible for this massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be punished before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb explosives.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but ultimately in January 2011, he was arrested in Abbattabad, Pakistan, where the US army killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contacts between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really sad to bring mental pain to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year.
Still Patek can appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Air travelers can now use gazettes in the aeroplane (but can not call cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play, movie, listen to music from entering the gate to descending from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - This is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
In a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in every airline.
Airlines will have to show how their aircraft complete new guidelines and how they are updating the rules for collecting training booklets and devices of their crew members to showcase guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already obtained schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetbu are among the airlines who have already submitted the plans.
FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can soon approve the extensive use of electronic devices."
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the door is closed.
They are expected that they do not start the aircraft at a height of 10,000 feet and till they are allowed by the captain.
Travelers are expected to stop their device again while landing on the plane, and do not start it till the aircraft is completely descended.
FAA said, Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interruption can allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, while landing and using devices at taxiing.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher heights are expected to fulfill these norms.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - then it will be a win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we have been bored with feeling like 'Hall Monitors'.
The agency said that but surfing by connecting internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, exchange of emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still there will be no conversation with friends, a game like online scrable, which is related to the famous incident is that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the plane park in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American airlines had dropped him from the plane.
And heavy equipment like laptops etc. will still have to be collected because due to their bouncing, the other person will be worried about injury in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be restricted during the flight.
Regulatory rights relating to phone calls are with the Federal Communication Commission, not with FAA.
FAAs can remove restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenkon of the National Transport Security Board, who is a national transport security expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered as risky.
Rosenkar said, "Sell phones are actually a serious issue, but not because they can potentially interfere in navigation-related devices, but also because they can interfere in cell phone towers when they are in the air. Can.
Industrial Advisory Committee constituted by FAA to examine the issue last month has recommended that the Government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the restrictions using them.
Critics such as Sen Clair MacCasclic, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
It is becoming more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is extensive.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when there was a report of interruption in navigation and communication equipment due to the carrying of FM radio and high tech gadgets at that time by passengers.
New airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by FAA.
Airlines have been proposing use of Wi-Fi at cruise height from passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Hurta said that most airlines companies should meet the eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under new guidelines.
Electronic devices of todays time emit radio transmissions of very low power than the previous generation electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, there is a nominal transmission of pages during reversal.
But the transmissions are strong while downloading or sending data by the device.
Ammon.com is also one of those who favor to reduce the restriction on the use of the device by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but there was no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks arising out of the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said that he believes that the interruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of interruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the Committee recommended that the FAA pilot should allow the passengers to shut down the device at the time of landing in less visibility.
Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common knowledge facility for people traveling in the latest round of technology.
Roger Do, CEO of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that FAA has recognized that travelers traveling with Anand are not inconsistent with rescue and security.

The bird was left back in the jungle by air transport to protect from North C Rig
The bird found on the North C Oil Rig has been left back from the coast by air transport in the jungle.
This bird named Water Rail was sent to Aberdin by the helicopter before healing him back to the rescue center at Eloa by the Scottish SPA.

Is Europe's higher class ready to do business with Britain
In April, Business for Britain was launched and pledged to bring together the business and determine what changes we want to see with UK's employment and prosperity manufacturer EU.
For that, we organized the largest and widespread survey of the UK business leaders and asked them what their ideas about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took into consideration 1000 business leaders, representatives of UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We have found that a large part of the businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while EU member countries are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to complicate in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their views about specific policy areas like monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
The common dissatisfaction over the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far more than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's business sector - even the vast businessmen who were traditionally favored by European companies, 40 percent of them agreed on this.
Finally, and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move forward on the path of trade based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was observed at the levels of leading business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating a meaningful transformation that would reinforce its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - Treaty Transformation for Britain and achieving a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU in the vote collection.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: It is a survey condition that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect a meaningful change to make the present power balance in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming very compulsory at a rapid pace because Eurozone is moving forward in the direction of affiliated economy and a fiscal union.
Priority must have jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show that it means a new focused focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation process of Brussels.

Prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of YMCA accused of sexual crimes, Royal Commission heard
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been committed offenses of child sexual offenses before being charged against Karingbah Child Care Employee Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in his statement before the commission, he said that "The case of child sexual harassment has not emerged in its organization anytime, the commission was told this."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA Keringbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual crime against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Gel Fernes, who helped the commission, said that he first knew about the matter, but he did not know about the other case.
He also acknowledged that YMCA's statement before the Commission that the external inquiry of the YMCA has been done and he has found YMCA at the forefront of child safety.
It is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified and it received the second minimum rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, acknowledged that due to appointing Lord, "Management has failed, including myself, and failed to ensure that the employees are clearly aware of their responsibilities relating to informing about child safety policy violations."
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during the two-year tenure of YMCA.
He was punished for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not inform the Lord of child safety violation.
Whatever the employees saw about the violation, gave evidence in which Lord spends time alone with the children, making them baseless personally, sitting in the lap, tell them that he loves them and plays on their mobile phones.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, had said for child safety training because he was worried about his behavior, testified that YMCA Karingbah, who supervised the Lord, was very intimidating and difficult to meet Jackie Barnat, a child service manager.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
He said that, but his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his approach to the YMCA NSW Mandal that "Jonathan Lord was about not giving the text "information" for the organization from the incident.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by the employees immediately after the charges were exposed was made by the General Manager of the YMCA, Leum Whiteley.
He said that its aim was to avoid the combination of evidence, but it was not executed "very exciting and correctly."
Stephen Smalbon, Special Professor of Child Sexual Harassment of Griffith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "grave problems" in the appointment, inspection, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to become the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of return.
In an interview taken at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his farewell from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr. Blair refrained from discussing British politics to a great extent, keeping most of his comments limited to the role of foreign affairs and representatives of the Middle East Peace Building.
On being asked if he would like to come back to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it is not likely to happen, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When there was a crowd of experts performing horse for the best horse in the year's cardiff, they knew that it would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even in the school and a few months away from taking its first step, this young child and her paternal Shetland's Tattu Toffee completed three phases very easily and won the top prize - she left behind her 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organized by the Suneback Equestrian Centre in Rudri near Cardiff, a pair of undivided pairs, which have been lengthy - were highly appreciated for the behaviour, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he screamed his flat hat on the alhar angle and made his two-year-old toffee round the ring.
Decisioners praised Fenton for their natural skills to control which are far beyond his age.
And Toffee gets the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was gifted to Toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and he has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland every day.
His 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fenton and Toffee are a glorious pair.
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the gold cup and roset.
This was the second time when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy about his victory.
The most different in this theatre, he felt so wonderful that he wanted to take photographs with him.
Ab Well, this small child of Nantiglo village near South Wells is running on the footprints of his anti-Sharon Havels, which has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Havels said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating happiness and was playing a rhythm.
He was running on the sand in the whole range, and despite seeing so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is the crazy of animals - she loves horse, tractor and farm, and she has two chickens whom she takes care of.
The kind of initiation he has started will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am confident that he will perform very well.
Annual horse exhibition spokesman said, "Fenton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his tutu.
They are very good pairs.
The decision-masters gave marks in view of the methods of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am confident that Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he actually looked very different.
"The Chinese newspaper will be renovated"
A press regulator said that a Chinese newspaper who had made an appeal on the mouthpiece to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, will be restored.
Guangjo's newspaper New Express gave a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjou.
But after that Mr. Chain admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a confused news about the partially owned company of the state.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to undergo complete reform.
"Sudhar's order came from the Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Eving News Group had published many false news about the listed company umlain between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that the editorial management of the New Express was unorganized.
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalties by canceling the license of "Chen Yongjou" reporter.
It had directed Yangcheng Eveling News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the responsible people for this in the New Express and to immediately amend the leadership team of New Express.
Mr. Chain wrote many articles in the New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-use company named Jumalon.
After his resistance, his newspaper published two mouthpiece appeals for his release and said that he supports Mr. Chain's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chain came to the state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that "In this case, I have damaged Jumalon and the entire news media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people."
I did this mainly because I was greed for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After the forgiveness of Mr. Chain, the New Express issued a forgiveness, in which it failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have acknowledged the fault of TV broadcast.
Experts say that from time to time, blame-acceptance is done forcefully, despite this, in the later half of this year, a law prohibited the authorities from blaming a person for blaming himself.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The US officers have described the four-foot multiplied three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the curved length of about six football pitch, which connects Tijuana, warehouse near Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easier to hide the truck filled with drugs.
Officials said that it was closed before any drug passes through the tunnel.
According to the records of the court, officials have seized eight and a half tons of Marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom officials told that they were working as a driver, were accused of keeping Marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If he is convicted, he can be punished from 10 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Digo since 2006.
After the Marijuana crop of Central Mexico in October, some of the largest tunnels have been discovered, which presents the challenge capable of drug mafia groups to reach the product faster to the consumers.
In the year 2010, officials found a road of about 700 yards decorated with the rail track, which was spread from the chemical of a house in Tijuana to San Digo warehouses.

British police sent extradition notice to Asanja
The British police sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange today, who has taken shelter in the embassy of Equador in London and requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent an "immigration notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to be present at the police station, and also said that if he fails to do so, he himself will be responsible for being arrested.
Associated sexual offenses are facing extradition in Sweden due to allegations of sexual offenses, as well as his options under the British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the US, fearing that he had asked the South American country for political shelter, on June 19, he requested refuge in Equedor's Embassy in London.

He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 US political cables on the anti-secrecy website, WikiLeaks, United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.

Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial position
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborn, who presented stamp duty at a rate of 7 for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the budget of 2012, and persons who prefer to keep houses in a company instead of a separate person.
In the tax year 201213, the stamp duty obtained from residential assets in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelesa was 708 million, which is already more than the combined combination of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Shri Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high value households and the introduction of Associated Anti-Avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that there is a minimum tax on high value property, which has no relation with the effect of the old council tax system.
He added , But this step could make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and unwilling to sell existing owners .
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, which is spread from Fulham to Vimbaldon, has increased by 11.8 percent last year, as per the price in Prime Property, Dhanadhya South-West London.
According to Saville's research, there was a regular increase of 5.6 per cent per year in Central London prices, but the growing domestic market appeared to be slightly less as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and eastern (6.5 per cent) bounce is being seen.
Scientists have highlighted the subject that what is the relationship between the acts of the dog tail and its mood.
Last research has shown that happy dogs shake their tail more to the right (for dog point of view), while restless dogs shake their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Professor Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trainto, said, "In humans all know well that the left and right parts of the brain are included in the excitement in different ways which produces positive or negative feelings.
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To know more about how dogs respond to shaking one-sided dogs by other dogs, researchers looked at the animals watching the films of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We may not take much time to understand why their dum sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We presented dogs with dog films - in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues in the realistic version or in confusion, and we could see the movement of the tail and present the tail more left or right.
When the animals saw an emotional dog shaking its tail on the right (sight of a dog), they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail changing the direction, primarily moving towards the left (the dog's point of view), his heart beat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what acts and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times with other dogs, and if they shake their tail continuously on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part offers less friendly behavior, you respond on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals to owners, veterinary doctors and trainers.
John Breadshow, the guest of the University of Bristle's School of Veterinary Sciences, expert in dog behavior, said that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right after seeing a happy dog.
In other researches from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot dog tail was moved to the left than the right, instead of being restless, it was more likely to reach it.
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs did not understand animals or robot dogs completely in films.
He clarified that it can help the study of the method of reacting to the real dogs by dogs.
"When various mammals have received a lot of evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and dog exception in this case, he said. "
However, seeing the easily their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their dum sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other side.

Pope Francis to announce the name of first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of Catholic Church for the first time during his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church have top-class priests, their post is only below the pope, and these people select the pope, so Frenchs will appoint the first group of their individuals, who will finally help in choosing their successor.
There are 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope election - it comes to the group of 120 Cordinal Electoral.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lombardy said that before the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be organized, which is called Pope-Sabha.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has already decided to tell its decision to organize a pope-summit in February, so that plans for other meetings with cardinals' participation from different countries of the world are simple.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters was likely to decrease.
He said that the pope generally declares the number of cardinal electors less than 120, the number of cardinal electors, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals above 80 years of age as per their wishes.
Valero said that the next year's Pope-Sabha will be important, because this will be the first Pope-Sabha after the French election in March this year.
Currently there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It would be interesting to see whether the new popes are nominated from the rest of the world to restore the balance."
There are forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after the formation.
Earlier, the pope took the decision of all things on its own.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that it is possible to seek advice from French cardinals.
But we are not in this situation first - this is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually the pope gives the bishop of big places as cardinal, but the Frenchs were completely amazing - so we do not know whose name they will declare.

In some trucks, there may be a reduction in the system of turning the front seat.
As a result, the union failed to comply with the auto security standards about the seatback, head restraint.
According to an information put on the website of the National Highway Traffic Protection Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraints can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."

On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent.
Obama's disappointment of voters
I voted twice to Obama than change
They say that Obama's great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of the GOP barrier.
The policy of blockade can not excuse Obamacare website's problems, drones attacks
Obama ' s 2008 Campan reminds me of what could happen
Nathanial P. Moris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I think this second year will encourage me during the sadness of Medical School and will raise the rays of hope in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get to bed with the prescriptions of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics had inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved to be unilateral, and newspapers took a break to showcase the historical importance of that time.
I had tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved the news papers available everywhere.
A team of young visionary people was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
During Obama's becoming President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval ratings.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memories, a sad memory of the lost opportunities.
After I voted for the first time, there was actual change.
So simply, no one could imagine it.
I give credit to Obama for many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask the end of the end of Osama bin Laden."
Besides, I believe that the policy of bias opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward to our country: including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, stopping the base on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But innumerable times in which I took myself in favor of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I ended the answer which I could give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition policy of the Republican is not the answer to the espionage of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drones attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the collection of data about the personal life of common American citizens by the National Security Agency, nor can it answer the prosecution of the people who exposed the wrong movements of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Avalaki without any trial, nor the reduction in public funds and expenditure limits during the President Campan.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that the attempt to silence the media by the White House has been the most aggressive since the nixon administration.
And recently, it can not excuse the failure of designing a simple website even after three years of signing the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could deny the political campaign to bring it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predetermined path because the opposition political party and random incidents such as the New Town murder case will shape our public discussion.
Yet, the examples I have given above are mostly seen as elected by the administration itself.
This thing troubles you the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidature.
Mit Romany presented a confusing and an uncertain option, which did not seem to determine his policies or his post.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes about which we have been listening for a long time.
However, while Obama's enrollment rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember their missing promises.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, describing how Clinton was not suffering a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-martum campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return back to the track and need to remain honest on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mozo back."
We should remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree more than you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are of Nathanial Moris.
Clive Pamar claimed that the interest of PM Tony Abbott is a conflict about the ancestral leave scheme.
billionaire MP Clive Pamar has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the ancestral leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters can be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in controversy over the payment of  6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the struggle.
The Parmar United Party can control four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Pamar has claimed that only the interests of the ministers can be conflicted, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
Mr. Pamar said, "In the case of given ancestral leave, he may have an important interest in conflict, because if any of his daughter is pregnant, then he will have a direct interest that he will get a leave or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Pamar as the winner of the Sension Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Pamar sought the revival of the counting of elections to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughter Francises and Bridget
Should the result of the election come two months after we voted
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why can not we have a system in which we fill our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Pamar also criticized the use of pencil to mark ballot papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, can he erase him
The use of pencil in today's era seems to be absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New ealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamar said that his policies include the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and they will take their new work very seriously.
Public posts are for public service.
He said, "We need no other award except for history awards that we can serve the community at this important time."
The plaintiffs had to face problems.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said the rapidly growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that the criminals have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative arrangements on them.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, then the security of the common man can be easily estimated.
RBI suspended two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, the information received from two people notified by the case, it is another indication that the global scrutiny conducted by the regulators in the suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barclase, Dush Bank and RBI, have confirmed that they are collaborating with the regulators in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBI, who have been suspended with the investigation into the recurrence of the Liberal Interbank Loan Manipulation case.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request from the regulators for information this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is continuing in this case, and we are fully cooperating with LDA and other regulators."
Last month, the scientific people had said that the RBI sent to the former trader and sent the records of email and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
This trader, Richard User, had left the RBI in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European Chief of Foreign Spot Trading in JP Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, chief of European spot trading in the city, went on holiday last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclase and BSF was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Scientists from the case said that Mr. Ushar's quick message group includes barclage and Citigroup bankers.
BSF said that after being told by Swiss regulator, Finma that he is investigating the suspected manipulation of the foreign currency market in many Swiss banks this week, he has taken action against some of his employees.
At least six authority at the global level - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority, VCO, Justice Department in US, and Hag Kag Monetary Authority - Bankers are investigating the allegations of misconception to make their favorable fluctuations in the currency market. Are there.
People familiar with the case said that, "SB, City Group, JP Morgan, and Credit Suice have also investigated internal investigations, or received a request from the regulators for information."
Banks are closely investigating quick messages and emails equivalent to many years in search of a clue of any wrong activity.
About the investigation, the news has created a stir in the traders of such areas, which have been one of the most profitable persons in the trading unit of investment banks for the last several years, but they have to face the challenge this year because due to low fluctuations in currency, opportunities have come down for betters.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that it is true.
Senior Trader said that despite the huge quantity of foreign currency purchase and sale, the fission of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platform by banks means "You can start affecting the market at a little lower ticket price."
This news came on the same day, on the day Credit Suiss announced the service of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
Credit Suiss said that "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and he has been controlled."

Supreme Court supports Obama Health Services Act
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act as constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges decided in favour of separate orders of the Patients Protection and Affordable Care Act, under which citizens would need to buy or punish health insurance before 2014, that it was constitutional under the power to impose tax of the government.

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for life, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras to Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the god of wealth, Kuber and Death Deity Yamraj.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Goodness is our feelings towards money.
There can be no more valuable thing than the money that came to the welfare of humanity, but the money that became the cause of ego has no meaning.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
There should also be a feeling of spending some part of it on the society, but the tendency of earning unaccounted collection or yen-ken-specific money destroys our discretion, personality.
The feeling of donation should always be in mind.
A part of the money given by you can also become the basis for someone's life.
We all should think for many people in the society who are living in the absence of terribleness.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the men of life.
All people wish money and gain and according to their male interest, they also get money and success.
The same wealth and property are sustainable with which respect is connected.
No matter how rich any criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor can anyone benefit from anyone else.
If someone else has money then do not enjoy it.
The true rich is the same who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of money.
There can be no other use of money than the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of currency.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try that you become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continued the policy to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then half a dozen states will not get kerosene on these shops.
In the states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand are included.
Apart from these, in some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Northeast, there is a preparation to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
In this regard, the Ministry of Petroleum has made strong preparations.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced considerably to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo liters to one lakh kilo liters.
70 percent of the allocation of Uttarakhand and Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, there is no news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently a difference of Rs 37.
This encourages adulterers.
In the states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at the full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be about Rs 31 thousand crore.

Since then, people are being blamed in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight businessmen from Indore have come out complaining in Cyber Cell.

I call upon the political scholars and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the party do
If its comparative result comes, then there will be no question in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got food two times.
But when the Congress or its supporting government was formed, the poor man was not able to eat enough.
A single Congress leader, a single UPA leader, is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
The media people of our country can not even reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They do not answer the media people too.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "Today questions are being asked to Modi. When the people will bless the BJP in 2014, then every year they will present the account of their work in front of the public.
In democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, a servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep leaving balloons on the day.
Congress friends, we have already given exams 10 months ago.
The public takes the test in democracy.

Believes in the first President to be elected independently in Egypt
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in as his post, but his victory day could hardly end the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On its formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the fifth President of Egypt after the first independently elected Islamist President of the Arab world and the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He sworn in in front of 18 judges of the court on his chair, who looked like an ancient Egyptian temple, on the banks of the Neel river.
During the formal function shown in a live broadcast on national television, Morsi said, "We are aspiration for a better future, new Egypt and other Republic."
The fundamentalist group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal organization since its establishment, and who has been targeting the previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer in the US of the party, said, "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation for a new life - full freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and according to local time, after a short time of 11 o'clock in the morning, Morsi came in a small convoy of cars.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President separately from the pomp of the President from the time of Mubarak, traffic was also stopped for a while so that their motor carriage is normally busy road, which connects the center of the city to its southern suburbs.
Morsi, who was ridiculed as Brotherhood's non-Krishmai Khali Tire, had a lot of increase after his victory in the personal prestige and on Friday, his speech presented him not only as Islamist but as the candidate of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against dictatorship Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue-coloured business suit and a red tie, took oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Kairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
Military band was officially welcomed by playing a national tunes, while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "The army and people are one hand."
Established in the year 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Kairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist student groups in the years of 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the dictatorship rule of Mubarak last year, and the leader removed from the post of the military council to withdraw the presidential powers snatched from his post.
But instead of assuming the competent oath of Parliament, instead of agreeing to take official oath before the court, they bowed before the army's wish, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currency.

If this is their crime, then they will always do such a crime.
He said that although there was no constitutional right to raise this issue in the Corporation House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.
The way Chandigarh is developing or going to happen, these people can not even think there.
In the Cabinet meeting, there was exchange of greetings between the two.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for retaliation on Narendra Modi in the Chintan camp.
About his speech, he also said that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled.
The Chief Minister's face also had the same feeling that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he is ready to sack the cabinet to keep his point.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a fresh idea in the matter of putting workers in government posts.
In the camp, state JDU president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
His signal was also that the list is almost ready.
The news is coming that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list from his level.
They will also investigate whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, large scale changes will be made in the list to give place to old and committed workers.
The MLAs and MPs generally have alleged that the opinion of those people was not taken in making a list of nominations.
The names of the people who came after a long time from other parties have been registered in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
In such persons, one name also comes to Sh. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village of Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was third in five siblings.
Five children of the family include Raniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumti.
Due to economic constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house in childhood only.
At this time, he used to set up a Bhajiye shop near Girnar, the shop's income was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, he reached the Eden city of Yemen with a ship named Kabota at the age of 17.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting jobs abroad.
But there was something else in the mind of Dhirubhai.
So in 1954, they returned to Vatan.
In 1955, by keeping 500 rupees in the pocket, luck reached Mumbai to try luck.
And his business journey started from here.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani stepped up such a step that never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani departed from the world on July 6, 2002.
At present, he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
Currently, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling their Sultanate.
Like the father, today the names of these two brothers are also among the international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was included in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.

I live in Shopian, which is called the stronghold of terrorists.
At my house, a security squad of CRPF was posted under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
I am also a bodyguard, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday.
When the security squad was going from my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate this matter.
Of course, when Kashmir's IGP Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted in this context, he denied the information about this matter and said that this is a sensitive matter.
I will examine myself how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.
If Hassan Khan's security has been compromised, then this is a very serious thing.
I am in Jammu at this time I am coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the stay of Atal Vihari Vajpayee's PM, a round came when for two consecutive years (2001-2002) No advertisement was issued by the government over Patel.
On Thursday, laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meter high Statue of Unity statue in Kevadia, Gujarat, Modi said, "Before this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent 30 lakhs in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM Candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA could not bring any advertisement to Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tewari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of advertising or the rate of advertising for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Proceeding through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, providing free healthcare to rural areas of Cameron
Well and his team see hundreds of patients at almost every weekend .
West African countries don ' t have much physicians there is only one physician for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or for anyone in the top 10 to make the hero of the CNN year.
The winner will get  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father conscious and unconscious, going to the hospital, which was not properly facilitated to help him.
Jamel Well, in the year 1981, was injured in a car accident near Yonde, Cameron's capital.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased, which spread to his brain, and he created a bleeding, which affected his rest of his life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in the camera.
If we had money then we would take our father out of the camera.
Instead, Well continued to roam around the clinics and hospitals with a lot of crowd about his father and got whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy.
You get out of the house at 5 o'clock in the morning that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since the death of Well's father in 2002, there was no great change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in the camera.
If compared, then there is a doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not bear his expenses.
Two out of five people in the country have lived below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is of the private sector.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty.
And because of being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolve to solve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
He started the Non-Benefit Organisation Escovime, which goes to rural areas on weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied the medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medicine.
Sometimes luck is not even with them.
They have to move forward by pushing the vehicle more than one time from rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: the best housing that can be presented by the feast, singing and dance, and by the community.
Free medical service in these villages is actually a cause of celebration, and Well - with its big smile and infinite energy - it comprises of happiness.
The next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekly clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get Baisakhi, donated glasses or free birth certificate - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not spend it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local identification.
The operation is usually done at school buildings, town halls or homes, after the process, the patient goes to a recovery place and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes in the operation room and sanitation equipment, and the well and their volunteers work on Sunday morning and morning.
This is a low speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in inspiring the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group comprising the doctors and foreign medical students of Cameron has undertaken 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
A person said that due to getting free hernia surgery, she will be able to go to work again.
The person said, "It will change the future of my and my family."
Apart from running a weekend clinic and working as a surgery doctor in the hospital, Well also works in a private medical clinic around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60 of his non-profit work, the remaining part is completed by private donation.
In Philadelphia's second year medical student of Drexel University and Vell's group, voluntary, Kati O'Mailly said, "I do not know when they are asleep."
They are either in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
This is an experimental opportunity for students of medical and nursing like O'Maily who come from United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mailly said, "In the surgery we help in catching tools for Dr. Well or cleaning blood stains, we have been able to get experimental experience."
As a second year medical student in America, you will never get the opportunity to do so.
Volunteers usually spend from themselves to reach the camera, and they often come with medical supplies of donation.
But after the arrival of Yonde, he takes the cost of his stay, and the instructions.
O'Mailly says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, the burden of almost the same work is not difficult.
Help others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy while doing this work.
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.
See Escovime's website and find out how to help.
You might not be sure but this is true.

Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You see the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he should answer Modi.
It is your duty to answer the public.
Clearly, Modi was answering Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled atmosphere where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate in front of him.
Modi said, "I promise the people of the country that when the BJP will form the government in 2014, then we will present the report to the people every year."
