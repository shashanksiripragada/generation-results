Why did the queen make a decision to adjourn Parliament - Jais McMillen
Once a long time ago, I had some contact with the people of the Committee Buckingham Palace, not with the family of the state, but with a small group of senior officials.
Even after 20 years, on July 1, 1999, I think it's a crime to kill the queen's role in the official opening of the new Scotland Parliament, but most of the United States representatives from that time have realised the political interest of power sharing and their widespread experience in the whole of the Commonwealth - the political self-determination rights and the role of the state's president is different.
In the midst of the spying, anger and shouting of matters that destroy the constitution with the latest shocking chapter in Britain's Braxid tragedy, a question in my mind is that the queen's approval for the Prime Minister's proposal to suspend the Parliament for a rare five weeks is usually what happened on August 28 as the Lord President of the Council of Palmoral, which is usually later in the summer.
This is indeed a small part of the Frexid Natak, underwent a severe crisis on Wednesday night, as the Prime Minister deliberates the fear of their own security of allies and friends of the murdered parliamentarian Joe Gax, who has received a large number of protest letters related to women parliamentarians and Frexits, using words like 'Charan' and 'Detrogy' on the Frexit, using the verdict of 11 Supreme Court judges.
Though this is a small part of the drama of the same rule, the queen sees 13 Prime Ministers so far, no doubt, it is not a pleasant and trustworthy woman, who has a measure of intellectuality and intellectual passing through the 14th Prime Minister.
The truth is that on that day, in their 67-year regime, they seem to seem to have made a survivor, queen and his advisers, who have almost completely avoided and decided, that David Cameron, in his memoir, had a stronger effect than his intervention in the ballot of Scotland's independence, in which people had said that they should only vote for a 'contemplation' before they voted, and that only the continuation of the trade unionist who did not change their beliefs would continue to continue.
However, this time the new Prime Minister proposes to adjourn such a long time before the Braxid period, the palace residents must have been warned, with a telephone call from the palace to the Prime Minister's house, it would have been enough to admire the Prime Minister to reduce the queen's sympathy for a few days or weeks.
For palace residents, the old customs and procedures are 99 percent law.
So, what's wrong
We can never know, or for decades.
Rani and her advisers might have thought that even if the result of the referendum is less, a new government should not stop implementing it.
Johnson and Rees Mag might have betrayed the queen in a vacation where there are no prominent people.
Or perhaps, as some Republicans say, as an intellectual and moderate queen of his people, the queen may have thought that the queen should be uncertainly helping the right-wing government to weaken the Scotland, Britain or European states that threaten the traditional authority system, to hide the palace and traditional features.
It takes 42 years to enthusiastically connect the queen with the fascist regime, the part of the Sex Pistles Committee, John Lyden, and sure that there is no inevitable connection to the history, state office and reactionary politics of the post-war Europe, but it can be said that the 1970s participant movement tried to start a dialogue on monarchy and civilianity, after which the United Rachima failed to continue.
Whatever the role of the queen in the sympathy, it is clear that the present frequency complex has examined Britain's unwritten constitution to its extent, provoking a terrible moment for the open constitutional power war between the government, parliament and the courts, and has succeeded in reducing the importance of the traditional role of the queen in establishing the constitution by being linked to a move that is now announced by a non-privileged state in the parliament.
In a short span of three years in one of the world's most stable democracies, their troops with Putins, Panans and hatred-encouraging portals will be very happy for the unstability and dissolution of the democratic governments globally over the significant progress of their plan.
Scotland should now be given a second chance soon to consider its position in relation to the entirely changed United Rachima by Frexit.
Laden and sex pistols in 1977 had warned the famous warning that you do not have a future in the dream of England.
However, the inflammatory dreams of the United Kingdom of the 21st Century lies and dreams of the glorious past of the 21st Century begin to shape the future of all of us in these islands and we all have to live in the country or in the horrible country, in the queen, without the queen, without the queen, without the queen, outside, by rejecting the lies and rejecting the illusions, by resuming the life of the 21st Century.
How much wages he got for the Kelvi Flatter Streetly program, who was his wife, why did he get out of Emmertel
Former Ambertel actor Kelvil Flatcher has changed the teless for Dans Floor in 2019.
But what do we know about him
How much wages were given to Kelvin Flatcher for the Stricktley Com Tonsing program
A child's father was reported to have been given a sum of wages between 25,000 and 40,000 for the 17th round of the Stricktley Com Tonsing program.
The Sun said that every popular is being provided 25,000 online in it.
The fee for those who remain by the end of October will increase to 40,000.
If 60,000 is provided to those eligible for black money, his wages will increase substantially.
As Kel's best competitor, he has all the chances to get a 10,000 prize if he wins the whole race.
Why did Kelvin Flatcher get out of Emmertel
In his youngest age, Kelvin joined the 1996-year-old Emmertel.
For good, he has been in the utensil for 20 years till he gets out of the anti-scutton utensil in 2016.
Speaking on the occasion, the actor spoke of his decision to get out of the ITV soap programme.
Speaking to Emman Holmes and Ruth Langsford, who delivered the event, said, "Twenty-two years are long.
These 20 years are amazing.
I am extremely grateful to Emmertel.
There was a sense of satisfaction and aspiration throughout that period, the Prime Minister said.
At the age of six, I started to do the same on a daily professional platform in one of the biggest events in the country.
I'm very lucky.
If it returns to the last 20 years, it has made many changes, it has given me a pleasure to leave and continue for me.
The Defence Council was told that African collaboration for peace is coming to power.
During his speech, senior United Nations Secretary General Mary Louis Rifiro Viati, the Security Council on Thursday asked the African countries to build a strong bond of growing ties to promote peace and security and sustainable inclusive progress throughout the continent.
Recognising the success of African Union and member countries in their efforts for high performance, self-reliance and collaboration, he welcomed the work of the African Union and African women's Famwiss Network in the Middle East by declaring that the capability to reduce the bravery of the learners and further involves such efforts.
Regional and national level transparent progress
The peace talks carried out by the African Union led to a political treaty overseeing the United Nations in the Central African Republic, with the support of the United Nations, the Constitutional Declaration signed in Sudan, following the efforts made by the Ethiopia and African Union, underscored the progress made in some African countries such as independent and justified elections held in Madagascar with the support of the South African Progress Society, the African Union and the United Nations.
During the last two years, he said that the collaboration between the United Nations, African Union and other members is growing in line with the election that has been organised by the United Nations Office for West Africa before the Assembly or presidential elections.
He continued that the United Nations and the African Union are closely collaborating to ensure that the ideas of women and youth are needed for peace processes and both organizations have young ambassadors and strategies to act as ambassadors and agents of change.
Further useful support is required from international community .
Despite many examples of progress, Vyati announced that the international community needs to do more to support Africa's efforts.
For instance, the peace process being carried out by the African Union requires more equitable, resilient and stable financial assistance, creating peace and sustainable peace efforts and political determination and resources, and active support for the African Union's initiative to pacify guns.
In the House of Defense, the General Secretary said, "It is a need for television and commitment to create coordination and enhance their capabilities," adding that the General Secretary, in 2006, looked forward to further collaboration and cooperation to achieve its goal of equitable, people-centric change and sustainable peace and security.
The Belfast High Court dissolved the Braxid case without agreement.
The Appellate Court in Belfast has deferred the case seeking to admit that the Frexit Policy of the United States would affect the Northern Ireland peace process.
Three applicants applied after Belfast rejected the High Court's verdict filed against the UN government's handling of the procedure in the Frex.
One of the applicants is Rement McCart campaigning for the supreme position, who was killed in 1997 by his son trusted soldiers.
This has happened following the UN Supreme Court's unanimous decision that Prime Minister Boris Johnson worked out of the law by shutting down the Parliament for five weeks.
The Appellate Court, which has three judges headed by Chief Justice of the region, Sir Techlan Margon, gave its verdict on Friday morning.
On October 31, three focused on various aspects of uncontracted frequency.
One of the arguments that the government's Frexit policy would affect Northern Ireland's peace process was rejected before by high justice.
During the appeal inquiry last week, Mr. McCart told the court that if the government was unable to obtain the frequency in the absence of contract, it would not stop the frequency procedure by repealing the legislation 50.
Mr. McCart, who did not come to the court due to lack of health, said Belfast would go to review the Appellate Court judgement with his lawyer.
I also think it will affect the peace process along with many others, he said.
I believe that my faith will be proved to be wrong.
We didn't prosecute people to warn, this is one thing I believe.
In the future, people came to me and said, "Remond has missed you.
It does not affect the peace process," said he.
I don't want it to hurt the peace process.
I do not want to experience my family and other family members.
I fully appreciate the judgment of the Appellate Court and I believe that the judges there are the best judges in the United Nations.
I should respect their decision.
However, I am afraid that peace will be affected.
The number of women in the science sector is not satisfactory and must increase participation: President Kovind
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, said that women's participation in the science sector in the country is not satisfactory, and steps should be taken to ensure the improved participation of women in that field.
Speaking at the 78th Raising Day Celebrations of the Council of Science and Industrial Research, he said that if the contribution of students and women in the field of science and technology is high, the achievements in the field will be more interesting and desirable.
In this context, he said that the names of Chandrayaan-2 Action Project Director M. Vanitha and Project Director Reedu Karidhal are being upgraded in all the houses.
We need to take necessary steps to ensure the increased contribution of students and women in the field of science and technology.
When this happens, our scientific achievements will be more interesting and favourable, the President said.
Our successes will not mean anything without equal opportunities for our daughters, he added.
Minister of Science Technology, Harsh Vardhan, Principal Science Advisor, K. Vijay Raghavan and CSIR General Director, Shekhar Mande were also present on the occasion.
Shri Kovind called upon the scientific community to be prepared for such a risk.
It is really possible to create transformative technologies and innovations, he added.
Scientific Archaeology must collaborate with education, scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs to ensure that it can reach industry, agriculture, hostage centres and new industries from laboratories.
Shri Varthan presented the fuel nuclear model created by CSIR laboratories to the President.
This is the first model in India and fuel cells are using hydrogen to generate electricity.
Joker's silly, frightening and intimidating
Jock's Phoenix has given the Oscar award as a comic book villain, the villain's power was in his obvious habits at a time, but the power has now grown with Joker because of the bold search to know about his appearance.
Trying to act as a joker is dangerous, but it has given the best results here, because the functioning of Phoenix in that variety of actors has been unique and brilliant because the story is half really surrounding the city of Nizam World Kotham.
Watching on the screen is silly, frightening, encouraging us to see us completely, stimulating tension, not sleeping.
It is a role to find out how Arthur Flake is a familiar murderer who thinks of being a Stand-up comedian, and this film has successfully done a very difficult task to make sympathy with him without giving much importance to this matter.
The activity of sustaining it is really reflected.
Phoenix is doing the best of this year, but Dieero has again expressed the highest capabilities in his work, in which his insistence enhances the scarcesian intermediaries that are scattered throughout the film.
This is not a comic book film, though it has been found out for the details of BETMAN, but it is absolutely different, that is why it is so excellent, there is no form, there is no routine and there is no law.
After the film is over, you may be unjoyable for a while, but it is eligible for the different dreams that can continue.
Saudi Arabia to provide tourism visa for the first time by abolishing the Abeya Act
At present, in Saudi Arabia, only foreign workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims are being provided.
For the first time, Saudi Arabia said on Friday that the most conservative country has been opened to holiday lovers as part of its efforts to increase its economy in oil and other incomes.
Enhancing tourism in the 2030 reform plan of Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the graduate that prepares Arabia's largest economy for the post-oil period, has played an important role.
This announcement has come within two weeks of a serious attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, which has stagnated Washington's crime on Iran and stagnating global fuel markets and fearing widespread regional conflicts.
Tourist leaders Ahmed Al-Kadib said in a statement that opening the doors of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment in our country.
Tourists will be surprised to see our treasures - five UNESCO world archaeological miracles, a vibrant local culture and a magnificent natural beauty.
Floomberg News reported that Saudi Arabia would open an application for online tourism visas for 49 countries.
Katib said that this Rachi will allow Abeya to leave the dress control of foreign women, who still obviously wear the body when Saudhi women go out.
However, he added that foreign women should wear 'green clothes' without explaining it in detail.
The Visa for this desert Rachi is now being provided to foreign workers, their dependents and only Muslim travellers traveling to the pilgrimages of Mecca and Methina.
Saudi Arabia started last year to provide temporary visas to the visitors participating in sports and cultural events as an effort to promote tourism as a rare event.
But many believe that this conservative royalty, which prevents alcohol consumption and definite social laws, does not attract tourists much.
Prince Mohammad is trying to change the new films, two gender musical sports and the entire liberalization of sports events brought to Saudi Arabia.
Audiences say that international criticism of the rachia's human rights list, including the brutal killing of Jamal Kasoki and actions against female male activists, would prevent foreign travelers from coming.
The fear of regional conflicts after the September 14 attacks on the country's largest oil company, Aramco, can also be made to the tourists without speaking the words of this Rachi.
The Government is expected to contribute to the countrys GDP by 2030 from the present three percent to 10 percent.
It says that by 2030, a target of attracting 100 million visitors per year as domestic and foreign travellers.
However, in the coming decade, when officials estimate that 50,000 new hotel rooms will be required throughout the country, the infrastructure for providing such a large number of passenger accommodation is not present in this Rachi.
Confronting the large number of young people being unemployed, the government claimed that the industry would create a million tourism jobs.
Starting from the start of the tourism industry, Saudi Arabia has poured several billions.
This Rachi announced a multi-billion-profile project to transform 50 islands and sacred places into luxurious hostels in the Red Fort in 2017.
Last year, near Riyadh city, construction of eight high quality theme parks, motor sports facilities and a safari area was started.
The country is developing historical places like Mada's Sale, which are centuries old, as a place for the tombs of Sandstone of the same civilization that built the city of Petro, Jordan.
Charles Sherf of BNY Palan brings them to Wells Farco as CEO .
The Wels Ferco Company (WFCN) announced Friday as its chief executive officer, senior banker Charles Sharf, who was the third CEO of the company since a variety of corruption emerged three years ago.
Sherf took charge from the interim CEO Alan Parker, who was posted in his sudden resignation.
Slone said it was a barrier to increase the pressure of politicians and regulations in conducting the corruption-affected bank.
Sherf will also be responsible for under the supervision of the Regulatory Organisation and resistance from the field of corruption followed by corruption.
Internal and regulatory investigations carried out from the outbreak of corruption have to face the unprecedented regulation of the Federal Reserve on its reserves note by expressing other problems in the bank's leading industry.
With more than half of the independent directors of the Wells Farco team joined after 2016, the group has been changed several times since corruption has emerged.
Recently, Sharf New York Challen (BKN) was the chairman of the bank.
Before entering the bank in charge, he took charge of the world's largest web site Visa Inc. (VN) company.
In another event, PNY Paulan announced his interim CEO as Finance Minister Thamas Kippans.
The bank further stated that as on Thursday, Sharf had left all his shares and incentives without money.
As Sharf worked only for two years in the New York Calen Bank, KPW researcher Brian Cleansel said that Sharf was not sure what he would expect from them as Wells Ferco CO.
Sharfin will be the first task to pacify the system and make necessary changes to remove the existing property control, he added.
Sherf, 54, started his life in the Commercial Credit Corporation in 1987, a consumer finance company conducted by Gemy Diman and Chandy Well, heads of two largest banks in the United States.
A alumnus of the NYU Stern Laboratory reported that within six months of his job at the Commercial Credit Institute, he declared Diman's assistant.
Wells Farco said in a report that Sharf would start his new work next month.
Eric Garden, who is at Rose University of Michigan, said, 'There is a smaller retailer from a bank than Wells Farco, so he will have to know a lot.'
In June, reports were reported to the Riders Institute that a group of lenders had considered that they would appoint a person outside the CIO as a permanent CIO.
Sharfin's basic wages in this bank will be 2.5 million, which is almost equal to Slon's basic wages in 2018.
In the BNOY, Sharfin's total wages for the year 2018 showed a regulation of 9.4 million.
The total wage of that year's Slone is 18.4 million.
Wells Farco shares in the prescribed business increased by about 3.2 percent to 50.44.

Parents arrested in the death of a 4-year-old Bumtel child named Nova Guadro - CPI Las Angeles
Officials confirmed that the parents of Nova Gwatro, a 4-year-old boy who died in Paltel, were arrested on Thursday in a suspicious situation in July.
The Las Angeles County Sheriff Department announced that Jose Gwatro and Ursula Warrez were arrested for the killing of their son Nova at around 8:00 am on September 26, 2019.
Both of them were charged at Bumtel Sheriff's station and issued a warrant to search for them at home to seize any additional evidence related to Nova's death.
In May last year, the court had ordered that NOWA be excluded from the care of his parents, claiming to be ruthless.
Las Angeles County Sheriff Department reported that on July 5, Nova's parents called 911 and said he was drowning in a pond in a terrain of Block No. 1200 in East Avenue.
Nova was taken to a local hospital in an ambulance.
The next day, July 6, he died on the morning.
Seeing the symptoms of shock in Nova's body, they decided that there was a doubt in the description of parents regarding the cause of death.
Since then, Nova's three births have been expelled from home and the Sheriff Department has started an inquiry.
Earlier, the DCFS has been investigating the atrocities in Novah at home several times.
NOWA's mother-in-law told the CPSLA that NOWA had to go into nutritional care throughout his life.
Hernandes' lawyer, Priyan Glabul, said, "DCFS's hands are rotten".
Today we have spoken about the arrest of his parents, but in the coming days, we are going to show the reason for the death of this child.
In the year 2016, according to the Times, Nova was expelled from the house and kept under the maintenance of two years.
In November 2018, he was again taken to the care of his parents.
Hernandes repeatedly maintained his robbery.
He said, "He told me, Daddy, I am here and do not send me back."
It is difficult for me to remember every word he told me.
Everybody's parents have come to the court on September and Monday.
Rakbi World Cup 2019: Warn Gateland announces Wells Team for Competition against Australia
Warn Gateland has announced that there will be no change in the Wals team against Australia in the Treasury Competition, while Alan Win Johns guided his team in Tokyo, he will be a hero in the country.
He is playing in his 130th competition by breaking the previous achievement of Kedin Jenkins.
Despite being subordinated by Central Staff Hedley Parks and Hucker Ken Ovens, Cathland has relied on the first team that won 43-14 points against the Georgia race four days ago.
Instead of Lei Haffenni, there is a change in the alternate players in the descending of the central player Oven Watk.
Nine soldiers who had won a low-colon number of Wells teams against the Wallabies team in November last were in the Cathland team.
Prof. Johns and Flonger Aron Waynright, after being introduced in the Ragbi World Cup in the Georgia competition, have more chances.
Flanger Aron Shingler will again be the second ro-bench for Starting Lax Jack Paul and Alan Win Johns.
In the Tokyo Games on Sunday, the first team will be set up in the T category and the volunteer will fight with France or Argentina team in a blanket.
If Australia wins the competition, it will be for the 14th time in the last 15 events between the two teams, in the event, the Gateland team will have to confront with the UK team in the last eight teams.
Buy a uality Guardian Photo: David Levin Myanmar
In 2016, Guardian photographer David Levin and architecture critic Oliver Weinread went there to document the changing city of Yangon between the biggest political change and Kuvi and foreign investment.
Its drowning British cultural architecture, particularly the street life, has been a source of numerous stories and films.
In this, a young man sells fruits at a bottom of one ordinary street -LRB- a ventilator wearing blue tea churt is just behind him -RRB- .
At the end of that day, at a certain time, when the sun was drowning, it began to shine on the streets, when everything was like lighting.
Canada Capt. Capton says that the World Cup will help to showcase their strengths and improve the team
Capt Tyler Arton has no misconception about how important his work in front of the World Cup in the next two competitions, but he said it would help to improve his team in a long way to showcase the strength of his crew.
North Americans, who were defeated by the Italian team in the B category in the Fukuoka Hagatonomori sports, were defeated by 48-7 in their first sports, and now face the World Champions New ealand thrice on October 2, before they faced the South African race on October 8 in anger.
Arton, who plays for the New ealand Club Weekado Seape in the International Super Rakbi competition, admitted that Canada is one of the few Canada players in the first grade, who have no chance to shock the Southern countries.
"We are playing in the World Cup against excellent teams... in this competition (after Italy) we are unable to win, gained crystals showed it."
(After New ealand) we must showcase our proud performance.
Many of them can expect the opportunity to showcase their capabilities, some of them will showcase their wonderful capabilities and get the contract.
That is our success.
On Wednesday, the success of the secondary teams in Kamashi, like the victory of the Uruguay against Fiji, might be very low.
However, the Italian team, which is unwilling to get the second shock within 24 hours, showed the best to have full-time professionals playing in the test competition.
Kingsley Johns, however, a Canada team trainer, said it was an important thing to play his team on Thursday, which has been capable of holding internationally for years and lasting for the competition.
Major League Rakbi (MLR) launched two years ago in the North America is an important step to reduce the gap between the first and second-class nations and the progress of Canada and the US warriors.
When I came to Canada, I realized the fact how difficult it was to join the soldiers.
They all had work in the day," said Johns.
But I think MLR lived for Canada and the United States.
It made a way for the soldiers and trainers.
In the last season, 51 Canada soldiers have been signed by MLR clubs.
Over 18 months ago, more than 40 people did other jobs.
This is a great progress on the right path, he added.
MLR has to go far away.
It is still in the initial stage, but surely a way to go to the first level.
I am convinced that it will surely accelerate and become a competitive competition for a long time.
The Council stops and implements the National Emergency of Tramp on Border
President Donald Trump speaks when he participated in a visit to border wall models.
The council voted Friday to prevent the National Emergency Declaration, which was used by President Donald Trump to finance the proposed border wall.
It was sent to the presidential as the Democrats passed the resolution to halt the decision of the majority council drum in the difference between 236-174.
The Republicans fifteen, who supported the switch.
The Senate has already recognised the action at the rate of 54-41 votes as 11 Republicans joined the Democrats supporting the move.
This is the sixth time when he becomes the president to stop the legislative legislation.
In March, he had already utilised home power to end the emergency declaration.
None of the Houses of Parliament have gained two-thirds of the majority to pursue the president's opposition.
Trump announced the national emergency in February, when he failed to get the funds required for the border areas in the southern border from both the Mexico government and the parliament.
His administration plans to withdraw 3.6 billion from military construction for border projects.
Democrats blamed Trump for breaching the power of the Parliament for finance and using the most important military funds for unnecessary restrictions.
A few Republicans in both the Houses expressed concern that this announcement of Trumb could be an example of a breach of power.
A few Republicans, who faced Senate elections next year, faced serious political pressure on the National Emergency vote.
The danger of death of children is more in air pollution .
It has been reported in a study that air pollution is more risky of deaths than in larger areas of clean air.
This is not the first study to examine the relationship between air pollution and child mortality, but this study focuses on various polluted factors at various levels in the lives of children.
Doctor Sara Kodecha, a researcher at Cartif University, makes it difficult for pregnant women and their families to do anything bigger.
Researchers also have a careful study on how pollution affects health in the hands of those with whom they decide to reduce the quantity of pollution.
If you can find some ways, you will see what possible interruptions are, he added.
An emerging research body showed that health issues such as air pollution and lung problems, heart diseases, psychological problems, dementia and low weight babies have been linked to.
This latest study, which has not yet been reviewed or published by cooperative researchers, will be provided to the European Respectory Society International Congress in Matrit.
Kodecha said that this research was based on data for about 8 million live births between 2001 and 2012 in Britain and Wells.
The group divided the UK and Wells into 35,000 areas of around 1,500 residents, accounting for annual mortality rates of children within one year of birth, with an annual average of three pollutants.
These include nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) evacuated by burning of soft fuel at BM10, power stations and refinery stations from harvesting vehicles and waste.
The team comparison with the best five parts of the mortality rate for children in five parts of each polluted most polluted.
In case of factors such as mother's age, partial loss and birth weight, there was a greater chance of death in children under one age living in a very dirty airy area than in comparison to most clean air areas.
The results of three pollutants showed that the possibility of death was 7 percent worse than NO2, 4 percent worse than the BM10 and 19 percent worse for the SO2.
Moreover, in three polluted pollutants, the SO2 was only associated with the death of a child within 28 days.
The survey could not prove to be the reason for the increase in air pollution in the risk of lives in those areas.
It does not calculate the amount of internal air pollution.
Professor Miriel Doletono, a populous child welfare expert in Imperial College, London, confirmed that air pollution would be a major threat to public health and the current standards failed to protect people.
The recent study had various regulations.
It comparatively calculated the average polluted quantities of the larger sections, but in fact, its quantities could be very high within a short distance, which means that children are not really counted.
The survey has not taken into account the changes in air polluted quantity according to the weather and the factors such as mother during pregnancy or mother's smoke.
Doleton said that the number of factors such as birth weight was not clear.
This shows a little more risk of air pollution to the child's death, but this system is a very superior analysis, he added.
The chief executive of the British lungs court, Dr. Bennieuts, said that measures should be taken to address the risk of public health of air pollution and introduce clean air zones in most polluted cities.
"The sources related to child mortality rate and air pollution are yet to emerge, but the risk of child mortality in the most polluted cities of the United States is significantly higher, he added.
During pregnancy and during the initial life of the child, the inclusion of BM10 microscopes from the flow is related to the reduction of lung functions at the time of eight years of age - even if the child is 15 years old, it is not affected.
Wood said that children cannot protect their lungs themselves, and this study reflects the previous innovations.
These two studies focus on the impact of air pollution on the youngest in our society, he added.
The Muslim woman says that because she wanted to salute during the work, the company did not sit for her job.
Shah's Indurwala is prosecuting the company for claiming that he was discriminated against him.
Shahin Indurwala, who worked with Autism's underprivileged children, wanted to get a greater experience in marketing.
Hence, he applied to the Fast Track Management Institute, which claims to be a one-sided company in the marketing of North Virginia region.
Asked to use his rest time to waste, now Indorewala is prosecuting a case against the company, claiming that he had been discriminated against him because of his religion.
In a case filed on Tuesday in the US Province Court, Indurwala said that it was 'aligned' by the Chief Executive Officer of the Fast Track Company, who had lost his Muslim beliefs.
He refused to claim that Indurwala had decided not to work, Chief Executive Officer Ramses Kevilando.
The U.S.-Islamic Relations Council, which filed a case on behalf of Indurwala, held a small press meeting outside the Fast Track in Falls Church office on Wednesday, claiming that the Fast Track Company was an institution that did not respect the law, but did not serve him because of his religious beliefs.
In a video conference press conference, Indurwala said that his first election was done well and he was told to come to the second election.
During the interview, Indurwala said that a deputy manager of the Fast Track Institute gave his company a long-term dinner.
Indurwala asked if he could reduce his diet intervals and take two-five minutes intervals in the work time.
He immediately finished the inquiry.
'It is not possible.
He said that work time cannot be changed here.
It has been reported in the case that the deputy manager went to Kevilando along with Indurwala and told Indurwala that the time for work would not be equal.
Indurwala said that he had explained to Kevilando that he was suffering five times a day.
And then, Kevilando pointed to his head and said that he had foolish ideas about his religion.
Is there a place to be regarded as a professional job because of my religion in the public
I am clearly discriminated due to my religion," said Indurwala in a press conference.
And it's over.
I left the office quietly.
I didn't want to make any demonstration at that place, but I was wounded and very holy.
On Thursday's telephone, Cavilando said he did not reject Indurwala's application, rather that Indurwala had decided that he did not need this job.
One came to the venue.
He didn't want to work here...
This is like I went to the grocery shop and didn't want to eat kickets after that, he said.
Recalling that Indorewala was a Muslim, he said that he did not think correctly about his demand for a five-minute interval during work.
Moreover, he did not say anything about his editorial: 'I am not a fashion expert.
One can wear anything he wants to wear.'
Scott Morrison will consider Trump, but it's not possible to follow.
Sometimes, Morrison does not have to say that it is a very good news to reflect the voice of the President.
On Wednesday, the media complained about its policy on climate, "all wrong" and "all misguiding".
Therefore, there is no doubt how to win the next election, he will consider the trump system and whether it will work in November 2020.
But political tactics do not cross the Pacific region so easily.
But one of the simple reasons for the surrounding Morison not to change the prime minister as a trump, the strategies that are intensively split up with the United States are not equal to a part that is decided at the centre of election victory or failures.
Forget what's in the middle, it stops voting for anyone who wishes to be on the brink.
In Australia, there is opposition and support for Trumb, so some voters may have been postponed because of his friendship with Morison, so doing like the president, there is no guarantee for success.
If the prime minister is turned into a trump, some leftists criticizing the trump are afraid that the world will become like they think, or they see the war for office to be secret.
Think about the thief.
He will not avoid and stop the United Nations Climate Summit.
He makes it a time-by-service.
The UN used its speech to talk about climate actions, showing that political leaders do not want to lose voters expecting it to be intense.
There is a difference between the views of the two leaders regarding the right to dictate what to happen in the world.
The future is not for those who think about the world.
The future is in the hands of the deprived," said Trump in the United Nations on Tuesday.
The UN used its speech to talk about climate actions, showing that political leaders do not want to lose voters expecting it to be intense.
There may be a long study on what it means, but the patriots immediately contradict with Australia's support for negotiating a dialogue between the countries rather than the impossible one-sided will to be imposed on others.
In an interview in Sydney in June, Morrison told the Asialing newspaper, "We will be more secure and prosperous in the world with the rules that have been agreed rather than only the use of power."
imbabwe: Economic obstacles are reducing the pace of progress.
Vamida Murvira, New York, America
President Mangawa has said that the neglect and evil obstacles imposed by the Western countries on imbabwe have slashed the country's progress.
This is an attack on the rights of citizens, he added.
This was stated by the President during the 74th General Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).
He complimented South Africa for firmly supporting imbabwe's demand for the two decades of unconditional removal of the ban.
The President said that even though imbabwe had registered progress in providing security networks to those who are affected by the society, it would have achieved even more if there was no restriction on exclusive law.
These achievements have also been possible in the midst of problems that have caused economic barriers to neglect law.
The obstacles, however, reduce the pace of our progress, prevent the revival of the economy, and punish the poorest and smoothly affected people, he added.
The President said that there is a change in imbabwe and is determined to cross the fact that the economy and currency have deteriorated due to the obligation of law.
Harare had to make clear that the ban on imbabwe should be abolished as a means of advancing his economic development plan.
President Mangagua insisted that the UN should utilize its power and respect its policies by authorizing countries that have imposed restrictions.
As a United Nations, we boldly value the principles of our Constitution
The world's mistakes must be corrected.
The unjust practices must be opposed, and must be opposed and rejected by injustice, racism and all kinds of repression.
My country appreciates the advanced South African community, African Union and all others who have given us a shoulder to demand that these stalemates be removed immediately and without any condition, the Prime Minister said.
Those who have imposed these restrictions against the law should listen to the call and remove them now.
Cooperation is a victory for all.
The obstacles are defeating everyone.
imbabwe should be allowed to start again.
At the beginning of these thousands of years, the Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union (U) imbabwe, have been banned in an attempt to correct the irregularities of land from the ethnic colonial regime, and protest against the impossible land reform plan.
While both the US and the European Union claim to be defenders of democratic and human rights, imbabwe prevents economic growth by continuing racial barriers.
Researchers have said that by making it difficult to live in imbabwe, the Western countries used these barriers as an atmosphere of reversal against their government.
At the 39th SADC summit of the States and Government in Tanzania, the sustainable economic sanctions indicated that imbabwe's economic and the region had worst impacts on the region.
The SATC called for immediate withdrawal of sanctions to the economy in the country and announced October 25 as the day of the SATC member countries to fully resist their opposition to various operations and bases.
Japan sees North Korean missile threatens Chinese space operations
With North Korea's resumption of missile tests, Japan has increased its warnings on North Korea's missile capability, not taking any concrete measures to prevent nuclear weapons spreading, and has succeeded in creating small-scale warships.
The annual report on security, recognized by the Council of Ministers, refers to Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbouring country.
The response to the recent North Korean experiments has been contradicted with a low-level response to the US.
Since the failure of this year's summit between the US and North Korea, North Korea has carried out 10 narrow missiles and minerals, which are considered new and advanced.
The security report states that China's threat is extending from the territorial ocean to space.
Japan is strengthening its security through a collaboration with the United States and initiating its space segment against cyber and electronic attacks.
Braxit News: Britain is on the brink of 'Thuruvant Time' as Fraxid opponents agree to be 'that's opinion wrong'.
The Parliamentarians who want to oppose the BRECS in Parliament will soon feel that they are in a very valuable place.
In order to ensure that Britain is not out of the European Union without any official agreement, parliamentarians are engaged in a serious fight with Boris Johnson and his cabinet.
Speaking on the telephone at Mike Graham's Dradio program, Pap said, "I think this is a turning point because the Frexit opponents have started showing who they are actually in Parliament."
They don't think they should be frequent with the agreement, they think they don't want frequency.
Because they have started feeling that they are basically wrong to do, they make their ideas more open and frustrated.
Pap continued: The reason for this is the basic reason for this is that he opposes the sovereign people of the country.
All these are moving towards a fundamental matter, it is a wonderful thing in our country that is our Constitution.
Many say we have no constitution.
On Thursday, Boris Johnson refused to apologize to the attempts to prevent the evacuation from entering into an agreement with the European Union, saying that it was 'deserving action'.
However, the Prime Minister acknowledged that any new agreement with the EU would be made by him to get the support of the opposition MPs, so that they could get 'contact'.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Jansan said, "I need to contact the bottom."
We are still ready to meet any new legal and enforceable proposal from the European Union.
Following aggressive discussions at the bottom, Speaker John Berkro insisted that MPs should abandon their negative behavior.
Mr. Berkro said: "I think that the whole feeling is enhanced and the events of yesterday are not suitable for the dignity of the House."
I know that in 22 years I have not seen a worse situation in this House.
The emotions from both sides were shouted and provocative words emerged, this is a bad culture.
Trump attacks the evidence of the publisher of secret, complaining is a patriot: News
The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times have said that President Donald Trump, who attacked Thursday as a 'maximately one blossomer' who is associated with a complaint about his relationship with Ukraine, said his actions to express his actions that are uncontrollable.
Following the testimony of the National Intelligence Director Joseph Makyar to the House's Intelligence Committee on Complaint, the President said on Tuesday that the dismissal trial of the Chairman Nancy Pelosi (D-Kalif) Trump was being initiated.
One of the unnamed US intelligence officials reported that a number of White House officials had pressurized Ukraine President Volodimir Selensky for calling for a phone call in July to conduct an inquiry into former vice president Joe Peden and his son Hunter.
Piten, who is the leader of the Republican Party to re-elect Trump in 2020
The White House then tried to conceal the conversation, said in the complaint.
The Las Angeles Times has written a leaflet of the speech that Trump said that he was a slave to the UN in New York City before the workers who went to the United States.
In such a situation, the person has never seen that statement, he has never seen the call, he has decided it without seeing the call, whether it is a man or a woman, he is almost a young man, he added.
"Who is a person who informed the complainant
Because he is like a bowl," said the President.
Do you know what we will do in the past when we were well aware of the sweets and patriotism
We have taken it in a different way, not like now.
NPC News says that no one has been punished for patriotic death penalty in the US over the past 70 years.
Prior to Makuyer's investigation, the intelligence committee issued a complaint on Thursday that it was not secret.
Trump's call to Jalenski said that the White House lawyers told the White House officials to collect the letter from the Electronics Forum to handle secret information.
Mayor, who appointed Trom last month to lead the US intelligence community, testified on Thursday that he thought he was 'goodly walking' when he filed a complaint.
I am fully confident that they have done everybody according to the rules and followed the law, he said.
The chairman of the intelligence committee, Adam Shif (D-Kalif) condemned the complaint and the drumping of his resources.
He said that the President's suggestion to deal with the complaints of the person who published the secret, and to deal with 'our usual methods', is a critical call for violence against the witnesses in our investigation.
All Americans must condemn such a threat to witnesses.
Faif flyers expect that the double competition against the belfast gentlemen will be so hard as far .
At the end of this week, the double competition against the Belfast team against the Celange Cup will be difficult for the Faif Flyers team to be unprecedented in this season.
Chief Trainer Dutyushiam said that his team to meet Season's Light Leak Champions, who went back to the Fif Ice stadium on Sunday, met on a boat to the Northern Ireland capital on Saturday.
We saw the BELFAST team as a very efficient, competent, physical and hard-working team," said Duts.
I think this would be difficult in the competitions that have been held in this team so far and I would like to play well.
As the two teams won a victory and a defeat, the two teams got two points after two competitions in the B category in the Celanch cup.
The eventual weekend events will play a key role in holding the first three seats and determining the time-breaking opportunity.
The Kirkaldi team would need to find a way to cross former Netmander Shen Ovan, who followed a special seat in the fibre drive to the Belfast in summer.
Not only Shen, but also our ex-servicemen, we have a great respect for all.
The opponents chose him for a reason, as if he had mixed well in that team.
After the competition, we will have the opportunity to wipe our hands with him, but it will remain as usual till then.
Instead of paying attention to whom we know and whom we do not know, we should be prepared to play with those individuals and get two important successes in the Celange Cup.
While watching the weekend's final competitions in the cup, after a 24-hour sustained bus journey, on Sunday, 4-2 failed in the Kildford, they got the first place in the ranks and got the best start in their League competition.
Tyushy believes that even though his team has succeeded in the beginning, there is a possibility of further progress.
He said, This season has achieved a great beginning, but I would like to further improve the rescue of bucks in all three parts of the snow.
It is still a part of progress.
For instance, all the six heroes played their words in the Natingham competition and played significantly in residing when they went to handloom.
It is a responsibility to pursue the scheme and to work hard on all aspects of sports.
If the buck goes inside, Gaulli or the defence personnel will be blamed immediately, but that's the last defense.
It is going to be important for our success that all the winners should always move on both sides.
It would be better to be at the top of the points, but if we think that it would not be our job.
We must fight for the statistics to continue to be at the top, it requires determination every night.
On Sunday, Kildfort reiterated the significance of having five soldiers on the ice after getting nine small penalties in the Kildfort.
We faced Penalty Shikal in Aram, which transformed the trend of laughter in a big way, he added.
We must be on the outskirts of the coach continuously because if the hockey sports had to be behind longer in the beginning, even if it was finished in the rest, they would lose the inspiration of the lamp, it would be difficult to regain it.
All the teams will talk about getting the best start and taking steps at the beginning to get a positive position mentally and physically.
He said that if a team is capable of playing well against us and reducing the flocks, then it can become more capable in its team powerblake, he added.
We have received the best attackers, so there is no concern about Powerblay, there should be no tension and ensure that there is no suffocation.

Desk to open New Ireland Ambassador at Los Angeles
The new Ireland embassy office has been opened in Las Angeles.
Las Angeles Mayor Eric Carceti was accompanied by Leo Varatkar at the function.
This is also one of the new foreign embassies opened in line, as part of the Governments initiative 'Global Ireland', aimed at doubling Irelands international resource by 2025.
Desch Los Angeles is a two-day professional visit to Ireland's growing television and film industry.
He also met senior officials of the world's leading companies, studios and networks, including Netflix, Hulu, Skatens and Fax Churchlight.

uestions arise when there is blockage of fire in the French chemical plant .
Paris (AP) - French officials and Normandi residents are constantly spreading foul in the larger area of the region, as the remains of the large islands that are in a chemical plant.
Though no one was injured by the fire that took place on Thursday at a Lubricont factory in Rowan, residents expressed concern over the risks of health and the damages caused to the Chinese river.
Around 24 hours later on Thursday night, the regional executive chief announced Friday that the fire was shut down.
There are still firefighters in that area.
Administrators warned that the new foul could spread to other neighbouring areas after the fire was shut down.
Home Minister Christopher Castoner said that those who are in a bad condition should not come out all night on Friday.
This factory is one of the most dangerous factories in Europe.
Diota is said to increase its share in Subaru company by more than 20.
On Friday, two people, who were directly aware that Diota Motor Company plans to increase its share from 17 percent to 20 percent in Subaru's company, showed that the smaller company would also invest in Japan's leading automobile company.
They refused to release their identity because the agreement was not informed to all of them that the agreement would be recognised at the executive committee meeting on Friday.
The investment will be carried out within a month after the Diota company and another small auto manufacturer of Japan, Susuki Motor Company, claiming to buy small shares each other.
This kind of connectivity shows how vehicle manufacturers are trying to control the costs and promote growth.
Traditional auto manufacturing companies, particularly smaller companies like Subharu and Susuki, increase in electric vehicles, travel communication systems and automotive vehicles, are preventing the rapid transformation of the sector.
On the basis of Subharu's share market value, Nikei Business magazine reported that Diota's investment would cost more than 70 billion yen (650 million).
With this, one of them told Riders that Subharu would invest equal amounts of Diota's additional investment.
Representatives from both Diota and Subaru said that this was not announced by their company.
Subaru has become strong in Sports-Utility Vehicles (SUVs) and Al-Vell drive technology.
In June, the two automakers said they were planning to produce an electric sport utility vehicle on the platform that would be created by both the companies to divide the costs.
Auto manufacturing companies around the world are collaborating to reduce the cost of production and creation of new technology.
Ford motors and Volkswan companies will spend billions of dollars together to manufacture electric and autonomous vehicles.
Diota seems to be keen to invest in small and domestic automobile manufacturing companies, rather than connecting other countries like some of its competitors.
It seeks to extend the scale in the next generation technology and provides free access to Electric Vehicles Motors and Power Control Units this year.
Diota's shares fell by 0.98 on Friday morning, while Subharu's shares fell by 1.5 percent.
The jerken club provides new information about the injury of the audio man before taking the shepherd unit and traveling to Liverbull.
Chedio man is playing in a liverbull competition against the Shephild United team.
Last Sunday, when Liverpool won a 2-1 Golkanak with Celcia, the senagel was hit by international braves and was unsensitive in his legs, he could not play at the time of winning 2-0 with MK Dans in the Karafa Cup race on Wednesday evening.
But on Thursday, Man trained with his crew, and his teams were not worried about the ancestors when they went to Bramal Lane for the initial competition on Saturday.
They trained yesterday and were natural, and there was no problem," said Liverbull manager.
The club also confirmed that Serthan Shahgiri is constantly out when James Miller is expected to be rescued from the back injury during the victory against MK Dans.
Shawk is still not ready and is training to return, the club said.
In the beginning of the competition against the MK Dans, Millie took a step on her back, and after the competition she felt very difficult but she should be very good.
Inaugurates First Training with Liverbulin Alison
At the end of this week, Liverpool Kolkipper will return to his first training with a long-standing expectation.
The international soldier in Brazil was out on August 9 after the first competitiveness of the Season, due to the muscle inflammation.
Though he does not have enough time to consider the Sheffeeld United Competition that will start on Saturday afternoon, he will join the team for 24 hours after preparations for the Champions Leake competition to be held in Redbull Salsburg.
General German Glab said, 'Alison seems to be completely cured, but can tell about the last word of the medical department.'
He will not be considered for tomorrow's competition.
It can be trained with the first team on Sunday.
I hear a doctor Alley, they're telling me.
Alison's wounds were intense, but in the last two weeks, he is looking for the best.
It will be a matter of pride for the medical sector.
When he started his training, he was waiting.
The audio man has been completely cured by the thigh muscle problem that took place during the last week's victory in Celcia, and another predecessor, Diok Oriki, who failed to fail three competitions due to the necklace problem, received some more good news about the wound.
The club added, "Both radio man and Diok Oriki trained yesterday, there is no problem".
However, Serthan Shakri, who was injured on the oxygen muscle on Monday, is still not ready to return.
How dare you
Dhanberk's speech in the United Nations inspires Dutch climate fighters
The Hawk (Readers) - Sweden's fifteenth eco-system activist Greta Dhanberg spoke at the United Nations Conference, asking thousands of Dutch children to participate in the global climate strike on Friday, avoiding going to school, forgetting the transport and turning to their leaders, "How dare you"
The Hawk, a participant in a protest protest against climate change on September 27, 2019 in the Netherlands, has painted a portrait of Swedish environmental activist Greta Dhanberk.
As the organisers estimated to grow around 35,000, the rally in The Hawk was more than expected.
The police had to convert the rally to another place with a higher shelter.
Just before the UN Climate Summit, 16-year-old Dhanberg, who participated in millions of people's climate strikes around the world, delivered an emotional address to the United Nations in New York this week.
Not only today, but also in the future, the strike is going to have a great impact on the people, in which people from different fields can be seen participating," said Rinder Rastima.
The demonstrators went through the Centre of the city with the tablets written by slaughtering the bases, laying films in Dhanburg, 'Protect the use of new fuel' and 'Protect your lives by advancing, 'Protect our lives by climate change'.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Route told the press at a weekly press conference near the demonstration site, "I understand their concerns, I believe they will be taken care of."
We have given a lot of goals to deal with these problems.
But we have to do it in a wise way to create job opportunities.
Despite scientists being warned for decades, Dhanburg's summit summed up at the beginning of the summit aimed at mobilising government and industrialists to rectify international illiteracy over the highest amount of carbon publications last year.
How dare you,' he said, had a feeling in his voice.
The Netherlands, with a population of 17 million, produced less than 7 percent of all renewable energy from renewable energy sources in the year 2017, compared to 15 percent of Germany and half of all Sweden energy.
The government is committed to damage the CO2 publications from 1990 in 2030, but it has come down by only 13 percent in 2017.
Dhanberg attended a demonstration on Friday in Canada's Mandreel city to discuss the targets for aviation.
North Korea denounced the US for 'incompetent' to remove economic barriers after the nuclear weapons negotiations.
The North Korean crime imposed on the US to do nothing to implement the agreement between US President Donald Trump and North Korean President Kim-Jang-un in the summits, but expressed confidence in the US President's 'select and bold decision'.
Kim Kai Guan, Foreign Ministry Consultant, who was received by the North Korean Delegation for the United Nations after a few days later, said that another summit with Mr.
The adviser utilised the briefings of the official name of the Republic of Korean Peoples Democratic Republic, saying, "Organizing another DPRK-US summit is now a big talk of interest in the United States.
But he criticised the absence of the US after the summit.
Kim Hai Guan said that the previous summits have come to an end to the enormous ties between the two countries and to express their political commitment to sustaining peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, "No matters agreed in the summit have been implemented".
Foreign adviser said that North Korea has undertaken a genuine endeavour to build self-confidence, following the first summit between Kim and Mr. Tromb in Singapore last year.
He recalled that the captured Americans were sent back to carry out 'discriminatory actions' against North Korea and handed over the commodities of the soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean war.
The North Korean official said, "The United States has not done anything to implement this statement jointly."
Instead, he pointed to the resumption of the US-South Korean joint military exercise, 'The US president had personally promised to stop it,' and continued sanctions against North Korea.
Kim Hai Guan said that the idea of North Korea's 'first nuclear deficit' and then 'provide a better future' to that country is encircling politicians in Washington.
As a result, the adviser said that this would make him doubt whether there would be a new beginning in US-North Korea relations.
But he gave another chance.
In view of his approach to North Korea, I know that President Trump has changed his political intellect and finally from the former Presidents, so I would like to believe in President Trump's rapid selection and adventure decision.
Kim Kai Guan, a senior political expert in the middle of the 70s, headed the North Korean Committee at most times when the current six-national nuclear cut talks took place in Beijing in 2003-2008.
Speaking at a global meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that the US has taken a bold political decision on the Korean Peninsula.
'I told you what I really believe, Kim Jang said: 'In his country, like Iran, is full of unused zeal, but to fulfill that promise, North Korea must certainly reduce nuclear weapons,' the US president said.
North Korea negotiated with the US last year, claiming that it was willing to abandon its nuclear weapons by negotiating its replacement for guarantee for security and the elimination of restrictions.
North Korea wants the US to do something similar to its nuclear slashing operations and gradually undertaking nuclear weapons deficit.
The US claims that sanctions will continue until North Korea takes significant measures for nuclear weapons elimination.
During the Singapore Summit, Kim Jang promised you to work towards making the Korean Peninsula completely nuclear-armed, without introducing any schedule or map for nuclear-armed measures.
Kim and Trump agreed in Singapore to establish new bilateral relations and enhance peace in the Korean Peninsula.
They met again in Vietnam in February for the second summit.
The meeting, however, failed immediately after Mr. Trump rejected Kim's demand for a detailed relief to cut off its main nuclear campus as a slightest nuclear elimination operation.
At the end of July, the two leaders agreed to resume negotiations, with a short-term meeting on the Korean border.

Boris Johnson attacks the Scotland government due to 'current deficiencies'
PM calls for introduction of "Compensation for Strict Deficit" measures, attacks SNP
Speaking before the Conservative Party meeting, Boris Johnson said he would expedite measures for creating a painful Scotland economy when he signed an agreement from Braxit or without contracting.
He reiterated his strong opposition to the second Scotland Freedom Poll.
Speaking to the BBC Scotland, Shri Jhanson said: They impose maximum tax all over the United States.
They have not been able to do well in comfort and education.
Scotland's Chief Minister Nicola Stergen has supported the possibility of the second independent poll.
I believe that the amount of investment now will be spent regularly for these services.
I believe that the pride of the hundreds of millions of financial assistance we give for Scotland farming will reach the Scotland Conservative parties, not Nicola Stergen, but the Scotland Conservative Party.'
Scotland's first minister Nicola Stergen had already stated that in the second half of 2020, another referendum was required to get out of the United States, but Mr. Janson had earlier expressed his opposition to the second referendum on the issue.
On Thursday, he told the BBC Scotland: "We held a poll for independence in 2014, when we made clear promises to the people of Scotland that it would be a single event in life.
The people of Scotland voted for the continuation of the United Rachi, because this is the successful unity in any part of the world.
They were assured that this happens once in their lives, and I believe that we should continue it.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Chief Minister Nicola Stergen Johnson said that he is unconscious about the consequences of his words or actions.
Wesminster's opposition parties should support the plan for bringing down the hopeless referendum to defeat Jansan's government and ensuring enforcement of the Pen Act and lead to early general elections.
Nothing should be done."
The Government of Scotland has been asked about the interaction with Shri Janson.
Campbe will be buried in Swimba due to the government's demand for family members
Instead of building a tomb at the National Heroes Acre, the family of former President Mugabe has allowed him to burie him in the Swimba ethnic land on the west of Mashonaland.
In an interview, Information Secretary Nick Mangwana said that the family has the right to choose the buried place of former imbabwe leader who died on September 6 in Singapore.
The family members of the former president RG Mugabe expressed their desire to bury in Swimba.
According to the government's policy of respecting the aspirations of the distinguished leaders, the government is collaborating with the new aspirations of the camping family.
Under the leadership of the family of the distinguished former president, the government will provide all necessary support for his specific burial.
When told Maurin Kademonga VOA imbabwe Service, a movement for Democratic Transformation under the leadership of Nelson Samisa, about the latest changes in Mugabe's final edition, the event that was buried by the former president would spend a huge amount of money for the country because the tomb built in Harai was left without regular consultation.
Mugabe's family said heroes didn't want to do anything.
They have been saying this since the day he was declared dead.
So they did the same.
So the money has been wasted... and our parliamentarians are asking for responsibility.
We want to know how much money is spent for that scheme and how they are going to pay it.
Family members say that the late President will be buried on Saturday.
Antonio Karso fights against Amarsana Souku in Jakarta
Antonio Carzo sees a lot of unity in fighting with each other in AFL and a meeting.
Though it is direct to see both the sports, the conscience of success is the same.
It was surprising that a new life in Florida, with a training with world-class competitors as ready to introduce an On Championship MMA, showcasing some of his amazing football sports days at Salispuri West.
You imagine playing in AFL, but you are training with an Amuseur Club and then go on Saturday and play with AFL personnel, he said.
Certainly, you can drive and catch it, but the mind and speed will drive.
In a few days, I will be able to succeed easily, in some rounds, I will be bad, but before that I had no challenge in my own place.
This was followed by a rigorous training session conducted by former UFC Welter Weight Champion Rabi Laler at the Hard Nux MMA Exercise Centre, Karuso's own place outside his own place.
The 28-year-old man, who was not defeated, said that this hard-training exercise had placed Mongolian soldier Amarsana Choku in the best position to confront on October 25 in Jakarta.
You may have to fight with three or four champions at some time and fight with them, he added.
This is the biggest change here, there is no simple rounds, there is no simple job.
I can't run before the training session and train after that, they're better than me.
But I got strength from it.
Choku (5th-1th) was introduced in the professional competition 2016 before visiting Asia's largest MMA incentive programme and won the MGL-1 Simple Championship in October.
But under Chief Trainer Henry Hooft, Karuzo feels a new man.
Henry, a trainee, is at the forefront of others, has seen all the worst days from the best days of a hero.
You cannot get such experience easily," he said.
(Shoku) The growing way is different from me, but he is difficult in terms of capabilities and capabilities, he has whatever he needs, but it is not enough.
He is going to be determined, but it will not last for you in this competition.
As a leading event in the event, on Velter Weit Champion, Capestine Cattestam will contest against Kyrian Abaso to maintain his position.
Electricity manufacturers are accused of producing renewable energy to attract environmental enthusiastic customers.
One provider says that the electricity provided to your household is 100 renewable, that guarantee is unrealistic.
The Organisation for Consumer Affairs seeks the Government Department of Offset to make it clear that the renewable power providers are personally dependent on the REGO and provide a minimum support for renewable power generation.
While customers are more concerned about the environment, some suppliers claim to produce renewable energy, it may have a risk of misrepresentation of consumers, he added.
We believe that there is more clearness about the limitation of renewable energy and the way it is marketing.
People can take the decision to know who can buy electricity only if the companies are more clear about their renewable products as per customers.
For this study, 20 distributors in the review of 355 rates in June, 2019 saw the sale of 100 renewable power without any agreement for purchase of renewable power.

"Make, you have got what you have to do"
The New York Times said, 'Let me alone.'
New York Times reporter Peter Baker believes that his wife Caren Pens has a great impact on her who refuses to meet women without her wife.
In 2002, Mike Pens, a special friend, humiliated that he was not eating alone with another woman except his wife, and that his wife would not join the wine prize without him.

Whenever this GIF had laughed at you before, I would like to work for you to examine the donations given to the National MS Society.
It will be very beneficial for me and those who are suffering from this disease
He pointed to his funding for the reasons he had chosen to support the MS Trust.
I don't usually like to speak pride about my fish, but this event is indeed incomplete.
My close friends and their families are afflicted with MS disease, this disease affects the central nervous system and prevents communication between brain and body.
Millions of people are suffering from MS diseases, they do not know there is any medicine.
You can help here.'

Mickey Arthur says Vasim Akram and Mispa-ul-Haq's ideas are "commendable".
The committee decided not to renew Arthur's agreement, which led to the appointment of Misba as the head of the country's election committee and a new chief trainer.
He supported the participation of both Wasim and Mispa in the team, but relying on them, the decision would disappoint him, Arthur said.
During the interview, Arthur said, "I think that some people whom I really believed in all this have not finally followed it."
MISBA was in a non-renewable committee and it was accidental for him to come to office, he added.
Arthur refused to talk about Mispa in the interview.
Mispa will work well, Mispa is a good man, which is the decision of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
I am disappointed because I have loved every moment of this work.
These comments spread over the Pakistani media, which published more cricket rhetoric.
Talking to the AFP through Berthy phone, he said he had the right to speak about the faith in the team for three years.
"I love Pakistan and I have worked together, I have spent three years with them and I have respected Mispa and Wasim, so I have given dignified ideas," said Arthur AFP.
I feel disappointed and would have been good if I had done some work that I could not have done in the Pakistan team.
But now we have crossed it and my best wishes to the Pakistan team under Mizpa.
Both Vasim and Misba said that their action was right after the World Cup.
"I am playing for Pakistan, I work for Pakistan cricket in some other way, so when I asked me to join the committee to decide the Chief Trainer, I gave my honest view," said Vasim AFP in Karachi.
Mispa further said that Arthur has the right to explain his views.
I think he has spoken his views," said Mispa.
He told him what he thought.
I have always said that everybody has an idea.
We expressed our honest views as a member of the Cricket Board.
I had a great relationship with Mikki," he added.
The current Chief Trainer of Pakistan said, "When good relations were always there, it would be the same."
Travellers urinating on Sydney train caught .
A busy video of urinating urine on a Sydney train appeared in a few metres away when the schoolgirls looked at it.
A Sydney lady, Jordy Lee, shared the video of the incident that took place at 8:30 in the morning on a train between Verington and Kingsouth.
Say this powder to everyone, he added.
He is doing this thing in front of the kids going to school this morning.
The record shows that a male traveller, who stands in a blanket near the doors of the coach, urinates on the ground at the end of the fifteenth year.
The Penrith newspaper says that two students have registered it as a man's worst practice.
The incident told the prophet that he was very disgusting, and threw it into the mother's mouth of the boy.
I am very shocked that this happened in front of the children going to school at a hurrying time on Friday, the Prime Minister said.
And it is a very abominable thing to do: and my dog shall not do it.
Her children told him that when they entered, the person was lying in the beds and then he woke up and started urinating on the ground.
It is said that after urinating the urine, the person again came back to a seat and slept again.
Many face-to-face beneficiaries have voiced against the hateful behaviour of that person.
How a beast is, one said.
It's very abominable.
Friends, urinate before coming out of the house, the Prime Minister said.
A Sydney Trains spokesman said that travelers should immediately complain about this kind of behavior.
Sydney Trains encourages travelers to be respected to others while traveling in our train series, the Prime Minister said.

Out-Hop Ireland Sportsperson Carti, who continues to showcase the best potential in 2019
Stephen Paris said that Jack Cartie was selected in the competition against Japan as an honour to continue to showcase the best capabilities in both Connaught and Ireland last year.
The 27-year-old Carti introduced the international competition at the end of February, who laboured with Italy in the six-national competition and became an alternative winner at the last time in the Ireland win.
After that, he has played an impression every time and played eight times, which includes the joyous performance of the Ireland team that was introduced in the second half when the Ireland team was snatched on Sunday.
On Saturday, Karti was given the opportunity to play in his second international competition, the first chance was to win the World Cup in the Cartificate Games against the Wells team.
A few years ago, many outhap soldiers had tried to train under Jani Cexton, who was born in Athlon, had chosen as the best brave and developed the challenge of Jay Carberry to that place.
While speaking at RTE Raffi Patkaste, Ferries said that the out-hop player's cart, including Jani Sexton, has continued to showcase the best capabilities throughout the Irelands in 2019.
I think he's playing excellently
He knew what he had to do in Scotland.
At times he played according to the situation.
He was inadequate to play and his defence was very good when he was dressed.
I would like to say that in the last one year or in the same time Ireland Sports Organisation, I have shown the best talent.
He played attachedly.
He doesn't leave his team every week.
As for Chexton...
During the last one year or the same time, Jani played badly in a single game.
He was out due to injury.
His activity was very unstable.
But Carty actually expressed a stable performance.
You need only one who expresses sustainable capabilities, as they are very much supported against the Japanese march that is playing all the best.
That's the sports management.
I think he won't leave Joe.
I am keen to see how he plays from the beginning of a lamp and how he handles the whole situation.
It's such a big sheep.
Japan is the biggest threat to us in the remaining groups of our teams.
But I don't think that the Japanese team will win us when it looks at the self-confidence and motivation of Ireland.
100 dolphins die on the African coast
More than 100 dolphins died on a seashore in Cape Verdi Islands in West Africa.
The local media reported that nearly 200 million hectares of dolphins had occurred on Tuesday at a beach in Bova Vista Island.
Officials, residents and tourists dragged some of them back into the sea, but many dolphins returned.
The dead 136 dolphins were buried with the help of bulldozers.
Bios Cape Verdi, a voluntary environmental organization in the former Portuguese colony, reported Friday that they took samples from 50 dolphins on their face side, and four dolphins were enclosed by the local council.
Animal doctors from Las Palmas University, Canary Islands of Spain, said the organization is going to examine in the coming days.
Para Olympics will be the first invisible competitor to dance on snow
Scotland Para Olympician Lippy Clack has been declared as the next series of ice dancers.
The crew won a gold medal for Scotland in 2014 Glasco and two medals for the 2016 Rio Games, will be the first invisible person to be registered in the event.
Five months ago, Edward, who received a male child, has the status of a 29-year-old visually decreasing starcard McColor Distrophy, because of which he has a slight vision in his left eye only .
He said that he could not leave the opportunity to emerge in a very popular event, and said, "After my final goal is achieved in the Rio competition, I thought what else can I do"
I couldn't leave this opportunity.
I would like to challenge myself and enjoy new things.
Senior comedians and television distributors, Michael Perimor, Love Island star Mara Hickins, and former football player of the Irelands, Kevin Kilfen, will join the Para Olympic warrior.
As Glasco-born actor John Baromen joins the Judiciary Committee, this year's only Scotland player is Glake.

The event will be re-produced at STV in the year 2020, and will be re-produced by Philip Shobeld and Holly Villaby.
Mat-De-crude should not be punished due to discrepancy of schizophornia.
Matthew D. Crude, who killed five people at a household guest in Kalkari in 2016, was found guilty of his actions.
An inquiry is now underway in 2019 to decide whether he will be given greater freedom as he goes out without observation.
Moreover, it will not be decided for a few weeks, so we have time to think about whether it is a good idea or not.
It can be said in two ways: one of his previously bad practices should not stop it again, on the other hand to believe in the power of change and rehabilitation.
First, we will look into its negative side.
In a morale, T Crude killed five persons.
It is a bad and negative attack.
He has a disease of schizophornia, so he was found to be criminally responsible, but he first approaches a psychiatrist and takes medicines.
His psychologist Sandoch Roy told the Review Board, "If Matthew D. Crude repeats another crime, it would be serious."
Even though his practice has improved, there is still a risk of reclamation.
But is this enough to be afraid
Is it sufficient to keep the T-crude closed
As long as the tea crude continues to take medicines, the risk of crime again does not increase, why are people very worried
I believe that this fear is a cause of psychological disorders, especially the people's sensitivity towards Chizopernia.
Specific psychological diseases such as mental and mental problems do not distinguish much.
However, others, including Chizopernia, are very prevailing.
Many, however, are being portrayed as dangerous as they say they are slaughtering others in the neck of the sick of the schizophornia.
In such a situation, we should take the same thing but such events are rare and that is why we remember it when it happens.
In fact, most of the people in Sizopernia are not inflicted, they are more likely to target it than inflicted on crime or violence.
Based on this, the fear of recriminating is based on a discriminatory mindset against the people of Chizopernia, rather than really possible, it seems unjust to insist that T Crude should not give some freedoms.
I don't acknowledge that the T-crude should be left unexpected.
A system like Barol will be beneficial to examine that he is constantly taking his medicines.
It is in a way to argue that he or others with psychological illness should be in the hospital as long as necessary.
It stabilizes the idea that people with psychological disorders, especially those with Cysopharnia, can never join society, following such disorders, maintains the view that they are terrible criminals.
When the court didn't say that he was criminally responsible, why should he be imprisoned as a man who is now residing with psychological illness
Alva academy provides coffee to the world 's biggest leg .
Blackmanshire: Alva Academy collects more than 300,000 for McMillan
Maximum funding in the United States for McMillion Cancer Assistance is celebrating the Trust's largest leg coffee in the world.
Students and teachers at the Alva Academy will give hunting, sports, tea, coffee and cake to the school and welcome the Glagmanshire community for a day.
On Friday, coffee programs were organized throughout Scotland for dozens of funds.
Within the smallest council area of Scotland, Alva, located at the bottom of Ochil mountains, has collected more than 300,000 for McMillen from 2004.
Teachers and students have been organising programmes such as pack sales, pingo tea, sponsored solutions and silitis for many years.
Last year, more than 1000 miles of pilgrimage, more than 1000 miles of cycling and 101,450 feet of mountaineering have won the prestigious Duglass McMillen award for this school.
This year students have already participated in favourite events like Swiss, Swiss, Hill Wag, Tack Wag and Bunky Jump.
Their huge funding efforts will end with the Hour Coffee Programme.
On behalf of the school, David Gliford, who won the Point of Light Award of the United States Government of Ranchi, said, "This year is doing well."
Skythan, Swimthan, Pen Nevis Wag, Bunky Jumps, Dock Wag, Dance, football and Ritthan Days, were accomplished in record.
We enjoyed bringing music artists to four different maintenance houses and organized a Pingo-De program.
We carried out more than 1000 annual sealith, Back Chells, Dock Race and many.
The Record Committee of the Trust with David Clifford, Christian Clifford and Shiona Fin led the Financial Court.
Mr. Clifford, who wrote a song for the musical form of McMillen Video Convention following the gratitude meeting of the school, said that there is no pressure to collect more than the previous amount.
Instead, the school believes that youngsters can give their valuable time.
It will be good to collect a huge amount, but that amount is only one that shows what we do and what we do, he said.
We are sufficient to see our students following the values of respect, determination and service.
Italy Hospitals tell the Government to work till the age of 70:
Regional Health Officers are asking the Italian government to allow retired doctors to work in a way to deal with the intense deficit of doctors and to allow over 65 years of age to work till 70 years of age.
Due to lack of hospital staff all over Italy, doctors in their region are demanding 70 years of retiring age.
It aims to regulate the age limit of Marus Employment Retirement as part of the 16th document to be presented to the Italian Health Department in the coming days.
If the doctors in Italy are now 65 years old or have worked for 40 years, they can get relief.
Regional Governments also call upon those who want to work continuously after 40 years of age from 66-67.
The capability of Italian medical personnel is unaware.
In 2025, 38,000 physicians (45,000 inclusion of general physicians) will be retiring, which will further intensify the deficit of hospitals by the Italian Universities that cannot be trained and sent to adequate graduates.
Therefore, the recommendations of the Regional Health Councils include the appointment of young medical graduates who have not been selected for specialisation.
Regionals ultimately provide expertise training aid to young doctors for a time bound agreement, and suggestions for close and close relationship between local health officials and universities, are aimed at accelerating the alternative to the health system for Italy's application.
Regions such as Venedo, who have started looking for retired doctors, have already taken into account the problems.
The Molis region in the south has invited military doctors to help and Tuskani has started selecting young doctors.
Bambio blames Syria for using chemical weapons in May attack.
Speaking on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly meeting, Foreign Minister Mike Pambio said that the US has decided to use chemical weapons by the Syrian government in the early attack this year.
Bambio said US officials had confirmed that the Syrian Chancellor Bashar Asad government had used Clarin in an attack on enemies on May 19 in Idlip province.
In a press conference, Bambio said, 'Azad government has done innumerable atrocities, some of which are considered to be war crimes and crimes against humanity,' he said.
In May, US officials received a report on a chemical attack in north-western Syria, but it did not get a definite decision at that time.
In April 2018, the US, Britain and France carried out aerial attacks to blame a chemical attack suspected to have killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
'This is very different because of Cluster... but President Trumb is very serious about protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons,' said Bambio.
He added that the US would provide an additional 4.5 million financial assistance to prevent the use of chemical weapons to investigate other incidents suspected of Syria's use of chemical weapons.
Bambio also asked the Assad government to release thousands of prisoners who have been held unjustly, including Ashtin Tice, a US journalist who has been caught by the government for seven years.
We urge the Syrian government to release one of the many American citizens captured in Syria.
The Uber App has been transformed into an effort to create a daily life platform.
Uber has announced several surveillances to his App with a new feature to promote services including integration of its food delivery and speed helling services to create a daily life hub.
In an introduction ceremony held in San Francisco on Thursday, Uber announced more than 25 changes to his base.
The integration of its Raid Hailing App and Food Provider Uber Eats and providing alternative transport information to the beneficiaries including bags, scooters, public transport and helicopters in some parts of the institute will be instrumental.
We know that it is really responsible for being an essential part of the lives of the people," said Uber CEO Tara Kosrav Shahi.
Therefore, we are working to ensure that every customer be served as a chief guest, every driver and hub feels like a valuable partner and that every city is like a good citizen.
Travellers will see the list of travel selections based on the amount, including public transport and electric bags and scooters.
This means that the low-cost choices such as mining and bus schedule will start from the list, and they can make announcements when they are monitoring trains or buses are delayed.
The new journey is in operation in Denwar and London and will soon be operational at San Francisco, Mexico City and Paris.
Though it looks unpredictable to guide the beneficiaries without using the car, the company has long been aimed at a tourist destination with everything.
To a certain extent, we are competitive with us, Kosrav Shahi said about the inclusion of the general visits.
But if there is a good preparation for the beneficiaries then we consider the integrated solution to the movement beneficial for the beneficiaries and we have the policy of ourselves to be competitive rather than others.
Uber Eats, which opens more digitally only restaurants - only consumers need food through the app, and is a contradictory profession.
On-Digital Restaurant is being used through an integral connectivity with renowned kitchen Rachel Ray, which will be available in 10 cities individually through Uper Eats for 10 weeks.
In the month of May, Uber provides these opportunities, when the PSU is unable to profit after several months.
In August, Uber reduced 400 posts to control excessive costs and damages.
In August, the company has shown an unprecedented loss: 5 billion in three months
At the same time, the new regulatory restrictions are feared to increase the cost of the company by changing the system of paying for drivers.
In this two-hour event, Uber did not mention the Assembly Bill 5, a new legislation passed in September to change the systems of wages and right benefits provided to KICE workers in California, including drivers.
Uber and its competitors, Lift and Temporary Service Agreements, have announced a plan to oppose the Act through the 2020 ballot procedure.
With mobility integration and changes in Uber Its, Uber has undertaken several security surveys for the App.
To ensure whether the passengers enter the right car, they will now use one-four target individual identity number.
Uber said that he is creating an ultrasound wave technologies to identify whether the passengers are in the right car without individual identity number.
In the App, the selection of Declaration of Safety Programme will now be to the passengers for sending information to 911 if there is an emergency.
In order to verify the identity of the drivers, the company supervised the theme "Time Identification Test" introduced in 2016.
These changes are followed by a woman who has been sexually assaulted by her drivers after hearing 10 million in April.
Several women announced last week that the drivers had made a case against the Lift company that they had sexually distressed.
The woman who has been sued against Uber has accused the company of failing to warn her about the dangers of her services to women.
In the past year, a CNN report reported that at least 103 Uper drivers in the United States were accused of sexually assaulting or assaulting their passengers in four years.
Uber also announced that if the customers travel by Uber vehicle, order by Uber Eats or converting the numbers available in partner restaurants into prizes and expanding their Uber Estate Scheme.
Boris Johnson's tax concessions will cost 26 billion a year
Financial Research Institute (IFS) opposes Boris Johnson's principal policy
These concessions warn that the public's funds are a threat to stabilisation.
Treasury spokesman said: "The President should take any decision"
Britain's leading economic thinker today warned that the proposed prime minister's concessions will cost 26 billion a year and mostly benefit the rich families.
The Financial Research Institute opposed the principal policy of Boris Johnson to remove the limits of both high rates of income tax and national insurance.
As there is a danger of withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement, these concessions warned that 'the danger of carrying public funds to unstable levels'
Reflecting the criticism of the opposition, the thinker said that the majority of tax concessions would reach only those with higher income.
During the campaign for Tory's leadership, he hopes that if the intervention is announced, it will possibly possess his guarantee on tax concessions, he will pressurize him to dismantle.
In UK, Wells and Northern Ireland, Mr. Janson promised to increase the length of high rate income tax from 50,000 to 80,000.
He wanted to help the middle income families, who were forced to pay 40 per cent higher tax.
In 1990, the number of high rate taxpayers has doubled to 3.8 million.
If the prime minister's proposed tax concession is immediately introduced, the Treasury will cost 9 billion a year and 2.5 million people will be released without paying 40 percent higher rate tax.
This is a substantial and cost-effective concession which will benefit only those with higher income, he added.
Shri Janson mentioned the plan to increase the National Insurance Achievement Status, which is now 8,632.
The IFS estimated that every 1,000 increase in that limit would cost 4 billion if they were simultaneously increased.
It warned that it would cost 17 billion a year to increase all limits to 12,500 for music with individual bills for income tax.
The report noted that most of the poorest 20 percent of the households will get 3 percent of the benefits due to non-employment or non-employment amount of national insurance.
The IFS insisted that if tax concessions were gradually inserted, Mr. Jansan's tax concessions would cost 10 billion to 20 billion a year.

Nestle increases the control of coffee beans after the threat of fatigue .
In a report on Friday, the world's largest coffee company reported that the clipboset warnings were similar to the maximum permitted green coffee beans supplies.
Claiboset is a key source in Mansando's deadly Roundup.
Judges have ordered the US judges to pay the most monetary compensation to those who claim that they had cancer due to clipboset drugs.

Nestle buys some of his coffee cards from the NKG company.
Nesley's stringent regulations couldn't say what would be the consequences of the NKG company.
NESLE (NSRGF)'s decisions to increase the experiments were not likely to affect the supply chain of international coffee.

Pear has filed an appeal against the verdict.
A study conducted by the World Health Organisation on Cancer Research (WHO) in 2015 discovered that the cliboset is likely to produce cancer among humans on the basis of the lowest level cancer among humans and on the basis of the 'sufficient quantity' of cancer in the tested animals.
However, the WHO and the United Nations Joint Group of Food and Agricultural constituents concluded that there was no possibility of creating a risk of cancer for humans due to the inclusion of cliboset food.
Somalia: Somalia's President attributes importance to the country's progress in the United Nations, but warnings that the elimination of terrorism will not be easy.
Speaking on Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly, President Mohammad Abdullahi Mohammad said Somalia was the most excellent example of the success of the multilateral organisation, while acknowledging that international and regional support and cooperation is still necessary to deal with the threats of Al-Saheb, a country in Combub in Africa.
Somalia's journey towards reconstruction is moving forward, but there is no one to hear or see about the impact of global satisfaction and poverty, inequality and unjust globalization.
Noting that Somalia played a key role in the socio-economic development of the Combin region of Africa, he expressed confidence that the cooperation between countries in the region would strengthen political stability and socio-cultural linkages.
He said that the country is proud of the successful conduct of elections in certain regional states before the 2021 presidential and assembly elections.
While referring to Somalia as an unparalleled example of reform, happiness and progress and commitment to restructuring, he warned that despite clear progress, the country has faced many more challenges, the first and the first important is related to security and that is all dependent.
With the help of our international partners, we are trying to free us from the last remaining violent extremism and terrorism, he stressed that this work will not be easy due to the violent, oppressive and opportunist guerrilla warfare of the Al-Saheb system.
However, with the help of the African Union Mission and other allies in Somalia, his country will revive stability and believe it is good for the region and the world's interest.
Talking about climate change, a key issue before member countries, he said that Somalia, which has a long coastline in the African continent, has already experienced the impact of sea level and temperature hike.
Somalia was affected by land wealth, long-term drought and destruction of forests.
He reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement and reiterated his commitment to the Defence Council Resolution 751-1992, inviting all countries to take necessary measures to prevent the direct, indirect import and export of Somali coal.

The Central Inquiry Committee (CH) of Krog Park confirmed the cancellation proposed by the Central Competition Control Committee (CCCC) following the events in the competition between Dairon and Down teams between the groups of 15 years of age.
A supporter was accused of expressing 'an unprecedented behaviour to prevent a competition.'
Delvin, who works with Dairon's owner Mickey Hart, chose a trial before the CH without accepting the punishment proposed by the CCCC and proved to be a criminal violation.
Telvin now has a choice to go to the GAA's Central Appellate Committee as an attempt to cancel his sentence.

Harker says that fat interest rates should be maintained.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker considers that interest rates should not be changed when events are going on, as a strong economy of "slim negative risks".
In a reference to the Open Shadow Market Committee of economists monitoring fat operations, my personal opinion is that without changing interest rates, we should take care of what happens after the events are over.
Harker, a non-ballot member of the Open Province Market Committee, said after nine days after his co-feder central banks voted for a quarter of the fat interest rate, it was the second reduction of this year.
He said the economy is strong with a target of 2 per cent towards fat.
However, he also mentioned the possible issues arising out of 'commerce and international progress' and the uncertainty that they produce.
With his views on the rates, Harker also commented on the short-term debt or the reposed confusion over the past week, due to which short-term rates increased by 10 percent and fat financing rates increased by 5 basic points above its target limit.
Even if these events are shocking to the markets, they do not reflect or guide the standpoint of the financial policy.
They do not have the impact of a broader economy, he added.
However, he said that fat should continue his approach towards keeping his corresponding point of view and extension of natural should be considered.

In the case of fraudulent music, Veyen has been ordered to pay more than 150K.
Approximately 150,000 has to be paid for the formation of fraudulent companies to book lyrics and he is not worried about replies to the case.
The judge had ordered the 150K to breach and deceive the contract with investor Ram, but the judge issued a favourable order to the current party when Wayne did not appreciate the case.
The case was launched by Nadan in January last year against Lil Wayne and Hip Hap Group Jose, in which they received funds for programs without plans to create fraudulent companies.
Legal documents demonstrate that a person named Eric Stenger had given 50,000 loans to advertise video programs.
He lied that Stenger had been associated with him from the very beginning and was advertising musical books.
He said that Vene received 50,000 from him, and thereafter never played a musical chest, and did not return the money.
Legal documents indicate that L.L. Wayne had been pronounced a case, but because he failed to respond, he gave a one-sided judge against Visi.
Normally, the court will give the last chance to respond to the respondent.
The 36-year-old man, who faces continuous legal problems, is a recent problem.
Earlier this year, his former registered company, Moments in Time, threatened to take legal action against him by claiming that his old sand book would not be bidding.
While Wayne had argued for 13 years, former lawyer Ronald prosecuted a similar case against Swine, claiming to have deceived 15.2 million.
These issues range from policy discussions to legal challenges in immigration, automobile performance and housing.
In a letter to Governor Kevin Newson, EPA executive Andrew Wheeler said that the government and the Governors of San Francisco and Las Angeles did not seem to work urgently to reduce the risks of public health by mixing unprofitable human waste.
The government had 'failed to fulfill its responsibilities under the specified provincial schemes' and explained how the government was responding.
Without any other reason, San Francisco accused Mayor London Preet Trump of 'commending' his city for political reasons.
In a statement, he said, "No injections from our waste system have entered the Gulf, not even more homeless, and there is no connection with the quality of water in San Francisco."
I want the President who wants to work with us on the solutions to the challenges that we face, however, our infrastructure, our excessive housing requirements or the people are not homeless. Eric Sheffer, director of the Environmental Integration Plan and former CEO of the EPA, said, "If we cannot control illegal expulsion from the major resources across the United States, the current focus on homeless camps has been misled.
The EIP also found that coal chambers near factory farms and power plants are the main source of water pollution and they do not face EPA implementation.
Earlier this week, at the United Nations Environment Summit, Newson said that he was embraced by the achievement of the Tramp.
Trump said that economic progress has been hindered, and the administration has withdrawn various environmental protections from living creatures law to Obama's climate rules.
During a fiscal visit to California last week, the Provincial government threatened to intervene to 'certain' the homeless problem, and proposed that the EPA should stop waste water from San Francisco's camp to the Pacific Sea.
Last week, Trumb canceled the power of California, a centuries-old age-old, to determine its autonomous expulsion standards, so California Attorney General Sevia Bekera launched a case a few days later, who continued to prosecute more than 60 methods of administration for various issues.
imbabwe: Visualized Doctor leaves the country for treatment
A imbabwe doctor, who was hijacked and wounded for physicians' strike, left the country later on Thursday night to get emergency treatment in South Africa, asking a medical team to say.
Dr. Peter McCombe, who was responsible for the imbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, got treatment in Harai for a week from being released from the bail.
He was poisoned at the time of five days being kidnapped, so his friends and colleagues are now suspected of liver damage.
Since he was released last Thursday, his father was accompanied by him at Kingston McOmbay Hospital.
I am very happy to note the action taken by the friends, and I am very happy because in some areas I think he needs more medicine," said Kingston McCombe.
Peter McCombe was able to escalate to South Africa only after the Supreme Court chief George Siveshi condemned the police to prevent the doctor from leaving the court order.
imbabwe's Minister of Information, Monica Matzwanga, continued to say that the police's intervention in the uprising of Magombay was only for safety and health reasons.
Matswanga said, The police is intensely intense to protect the people by inquiring those accused of past and putting them in front of justice.
They needed the court's help to delay the uprising of Dr. McCombay to South Africa, because they could give him important obligations to carry out their trial.
It is the duty of the police to protect all its citizens.
As McCombe left imbabwe for medical treatment, his association says that doctors did not withdraw their three-week strike.
His colleagues say that the physician was hijacked on September 3 to call for a strike to pressure Emerson Mangawa to increase the wages of doctors with less than 200 per month.
