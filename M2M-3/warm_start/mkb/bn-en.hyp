Mann Ki Baat October, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I congratulate all of you on the occasion of Deepawali and we have been told here - 'Shubham Karoti Kalyana Aarogya Sampadam.
Deepajyotinmostu in the enemy's destruction.
How beautiful a message.
Today, Deepawali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
In particular, not only are Indians involved in this festival, but the governments of many countries, citizens and social organizations of that country celebrate the Deepawali festival with fervor.
There is a kind of India.
Friends, Festivals in the world have a different attraction of tourism.
Our India is a country of festivals, there is a great opportunity for tourism.
We should try to celebrate all these festivals, be it Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and join the people of other states and other countries.
We have so many festivals in every state and every region and people of other countries are keen on these festivals.
That is why Indians living outside the country have an important role to play in promoting tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat last year, I have decided to do something different on this occasion of Deepawali.
I said, Come, let us all celebrate this Deepawali with the strength of Indian women and their achievements, that is, the honor of India's Lakshmi.
Just after seeing this, there is a lot of inspiring stories in the synchronous media.
World's cockroach Romesh, wrote the Namo App, "My mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we're five brothers in good lives.
My mother is my Lord.
Everything of me, he looks at Indias Lakshmi.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Speaking on the Twitter, Skilled Geetika Swami said that she was accompanied by Maj Khushboo Kunar Bharat Lakshmi, daughter of bus conductor and she led the Womens Force of Assam Rifles.
His daughter Laxmi, her daughter, who is also powerful to poet Tiwari ji.
He was proud that his daughter took a very good picture, and took a very good place in the clatter's test.
A 92-year-old woman has been giving water to travellers at Gualior Railway Station for several years.
Megaji, this Laxmi has been very inspired by the nature and compassion of India.
Many such stories have been shared.
You must read, take inspiration and share some things around yourself.
I salute all these lakhs of India.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnama, the famous woman of the seventeenth century, wrote a poem in Kannada in 17th century.
This feeling, that all the words of India, that Lakshmi, whom we are talking, seem to have done the last seventeenth century.
The beautiful words, how beautiful theory, and how many high ideals are included in this poem of Kannada, Peninda Permegandu Himavantu, Peninda Brigu Perchidnupanu Perchidanupenda Janakrayanu Jasabadanu, the Himavantu, the king of the mountains, for his daughter Parvati, the sage Brigu was famous for her daughter Laxmi and the public for her daughter-in-law.
Our daughters have a strong identity of our society and a bright future through the great work of our pride and these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on November 12, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but also in the world.
There are many of our Sikh brothers and sisters in this world who have dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget about my guru's journey in Venkuver and Tehran.
There are many things about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, whom I can share with you, but for this there will be a lot of changes in the mind.
He has always placed the service work on everyone.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service work done freely is invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has delivered his message to the world.
He was one of the most travellers of his time.
He went to many places and wherever he set his heart through his simplicity, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has visited several important religious places.
It is said that Sadhu of Assam, Shankardev was also inspired by his ideals.
He also travelled on the holy land of Haridwar.
During the departure journey of Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
Visitors, Guru Nanak Dev ji, a famous place called Guru Nanak jira Saheb, which reminds us of his memories.
Guru Nanak ji visited Kashmir in the north and surrounding areas during an admiration.
This envisages a strong relationship between the followers of Sikhism and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and he was accepted as Guru.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and he was worshipped there.
And at a time of generosity, he traveled in a wide range of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of lakhs of people, with full respect, following his teachings and doing it even today.
And this journey was organised to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all those princes, along with the Golden Temple philosophy, have the opportunity to visit the Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who integrated the country with unity.
Just like Sardar Patel had a miraculous capability to gather people, similarly, those with whom there was a differing difference were able to coordinate with them.
Sardar Patel used to closely monitor and look after the examiners.
In this regard, he was Man of Detail.
He was also expert in organisational skills.
He was also specially efficient in planning and creating technologies.
When Sardar Saheb is reading or listening about the functioning of Sardar Saheb, he can know how extraordinary theory of overplaning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Ahmedabad session.
He ensured that nobody was suffering from water.
He interacted with farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
See again, that's why the sale of khadi has increased.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution Council.
He does an important job to ensure our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of nation or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, had done the historic and important work of uniting the segment states and territories of this country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a specialty that he wouldn't have lost his sight.
On one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Likewise, the Lakshadweep and his goals of the south have not been lost.
When we describe Sardar Patel's efforts, we discuss his role in certain parts of this country.
For a small shore like Lakshadweep but he played an important role .
Immediately after getting this news , Sardar Patel took strict steps without delay .
He directed the brothers of Mudalia, Architect Ramswamy Mudaliar and Architect Laxmanswamy Mudalia to take the trekkers and hoist the national flag there immediately.
As per his instruction the waves were made immediately and the desire to capture the neighbour on Lakshadweep was defeated .
After this incident Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudalia that they personally ensured that all kinds of help is available in the development of Lakshadweep .
Today, Lakshadweep is playing a very important role in the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination and .
I hope you're going to visit this beautiful island and their seashore.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the longest human statue in the world.
It's twice the Statue of Liberty of America.
The longest idol of the world fills the heart of every Indian with pride -LRB- as Indian -RRB- when it feels that the longest idol of the world is established in our country .
The head of every Indian becomes high in self-respect .
You will be happy to know that only in a year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity .
That is, everyday eight and a half thousand people have made the glorious hope of this Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the faith and reverence that he has in his heart has been expressed .
Now there are several attraction centres like cake gardens, leopard gardens, wild safari, child nutrition parks, unity nursery etc.
Professional training is also being given at home or at home for hospitalization .
Local people have now started dragon-fruit farming and I am sure this will become the main way to achieve their lives.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a study for the country, for every state and for tourism industry.
How can we testify that one place can become a world famous tourist center within a year where people of the country and abroad come .
Traffic systems, accommodation places, guides, environment friendly arrangements are being improved each other.
There has been a huge economic growth and as per the needs of tourists , local people are innovating services .
The government is taking its own obligations.
Friends , is there any Indian who will not be proud to know that a few days ago the Time magazine has placed this Statue of Unity among the 100 best tourist spots in the world .
I hope that all of you will go to see this Statue of Unity by taking out some space from your precious time , but I wish that every Indian who goes out for tour , he goes to the last fifteen destinations of the country in the family and stays there at night .
Friends, you know that every year 31st October is being celebrated as National Integration Day from 2014.
This day indicates to maintain unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
This time also the run for unity is being organized.
This will include all sections of society.
Running is beneficial for both mind and body.
I hope you all will participate on 31st October to keep the country's unity and your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel had bound the country in the form of unity.
This mantra of unity is a reform of our lives and we must try to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and concerns of the country.
There will be many examples around us that are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their talk gets very quickly from our memory.
Friends, I remember the month of September, 2010 when the Allahabad High Court had given the opinion of Ram on the birthplace.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi was also killed this day.
My dear countrymen, today, if every household, every village has a story, from the east to the west, from the north to the south, if there is a story in every corner of India then it is cleanliness.
I want to talk to every person, every family, every village about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of hundreds of millions of Indians.
Hence, the benefits of this are also 100 crore Indians.
But there is a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I'm listening and listening to you.
In such a difficult situation, it is no less valour than to be so opposite.
In such a terrible situation, our brutal soldiers are not only safeguarding the borders of the country, but they are also running a Swachh Siachen campaign.
There's so cold that nobody melts.
In such a situation, separating waste is an important task to manage it.
We all know that Siachen is a stream of rivers and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas and use river water like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that creates a new consciousness in all of us.
And in Deepawali, some or the other new ones, some or the other, some or the other, some or the other, some or the other, some or the other, some or the other, or the other.
I once said we tried to buy local things.
If we find ourselves in our village, we don't need to go to Tahsil.
I don't need to go to the district if you find it.
The more we are trying to buy local things, the more Gandhiji 150 you will be converted into a great festival.
And I always urge that we don't talk to the bag, we should buy something made by our Khadi workers.
Even before Deepawali, we have bought a lot before Deepawali, but there are many people who believe that after Deepawali, perhaps things will be cheaper.
So there's a lot of people who're still buying.
Therefore, as soon as I congratulate Deepawali, I urge you to come here to know why we want local things.
See, what we can play a key role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
On Deepawali, we use Baji as everyone.
But sometimes the fire takes place unconsciously.
Sometimes it gets hurt.
I urge all of you to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
I have a lot of good wishes.
Thank you a lot.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Is there any Indian who doesn't feel proud of our armed forces and our soldiers
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recall the incident of social strike in 2016, when our soldiers responded in the name of Praxi War on the basis of terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions across the country so that the lions, especially the youth of the country, can realize our energy, how capable and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by risking their lives.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, our Armed Forces have a glorious heritage for the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function in the land of brave soldiers in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is sure that our soldiers will give a sufficient answer to all those who want to destroy the environment of peace and progress of our country.
But it is not a matter of pride, and it is not a matter of privilege to exchange the power of the country.
India is always committed to maintaining peace and security.
More than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace in the two-two wars of the twentieth century.
Our vision never falls on the land of any other country.
It was our responsibility for peace.
A few days ago, on 23rd September, we recalled the heroic soldiers of Mahisur, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansar on the centenary of Haifa war in Israel who had freed Haifa from the attackers.
It was also a parameter to showcase our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of armed forces in the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have been playing an important role in the peace system of the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, our air force is unparalleled.
The Fly Past, where our Air Force has a glimpse of unprecedented artistic and energy.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
When Pakistani invaders started attacking in 1947, the Air Force ensured that Indian forces and warships reach the territory of war to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the enemies in the war of 1997.
Who doesn't know about Bangladesh in 1997
In 1999, the Air Force played a very important role in liberating Kargil from the intruders.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force lay their foundations on the opponents' territory.
Whether it is relief and rescue or emergency management, the entire country is grateful to them for their significant role in the Air Force.
The Air Force's contribution is reflective in tackling natural calamities such as suffocation, jeopardy, floods or terrible disasters and the help of the countrymen.
In order to ensure the equality of the gender equity in the country, the Air Force has set a glimpse and opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving the opportunity to choose the option of SHART Service Commission along with the Permanent Commission, which I had announced on the 15th of August this year from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that not only male power in the Indian Armed Forces but also the contribution of women power is increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know that Ablas Tommy is a brutal, brave and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash first Indian who was touring the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
The Golden Global Race in the south of the Indian Ocean for 80 days is in the midst of a terrible ocean.
I'm gonna tell you how to do such a brave thing...
I pray for the fast health of Abhilash Tommy and hope that his courage, this bravery, this determination to win this fight will inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know what importance is on 2nd October.
This year there is a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the centenary of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi for the next two years.
The thoughts and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Dr. Abdul Luthar King Joseph or Nelson Mandella, all of them have gained strength from Gandhiji's ideals, they have fought a long struggle to achieve equal rights and respect for the tribe.
Today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to discuss with you another important task of worshipping Bapu, which all the people of the country need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi began to compose some ideas as a constructive programme or organisational programme.
After that, when the freedom struggle became strong in 1997, Gandhiji made a revised image of his thoughts.
The revered Bapuji brought his thoughts to the people of the country, to protect the rights of the people of the village and to the labour brothers, to the extent of cleanliness and to the spread of education, which is also called Gandhi Charter.
Popular Bapu was a people-to-people.
Together with the people, Bapu's specialty of accepting the people was his nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the people of the country very important and important for the development of the country.
He made this achievement a mass movement which was his best contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society dedicated themselves to Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which we know as the magic of Gandhiji.
There Gandhiji said, "I am talking about such a trick, whenever you feel doubt or ego will enjoy your mind, remember my thoughts.
You remember the face of the poorest and weakest person in your life and ask your mind... the steps you're thinking will be useful for that man.
Is it possible for millions of hungry and underprivileged people to achieve self-reliance
That's why you're gonna target your doubts and arrogance.
My dear countrymen, a strategy of Gandhiji is still equally important.
The economic power and purchase capacity of the growing middle class of the country is enhancing today.
If that benefit comes to the poor people, then my happiness will be multiplied.
Whenever we buy something in memory of Gandhiji's vision in the coming days, along with the celebrations of Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, we must keep in mind that every purchase is the best of our countrymen and those who have been sweating in the production of goods, those who have invested in their talent, everybody has some benefits.
This is Gandhiji's strategy, this is Gandhiji's message, I believe that a small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we might be able to contribute to the economic progress and economic empowerment of our country through this small task and to the strength of fighting against poverty.
And I believe that this is the real patriot of todays life, this is a tribute to the work of revered Bapu.
For example, on the occasion of a special event, think of buying fertilizer and handicrafts.
Two days later, we will celebrate Shastri ji's birth anniversary with revered Bapu.
As soon as Shastri ji's name rises, we have an unlimited respect in the minds of the Indians.
His glorious personality always fills the hearts of every countrymen.
He was very soft from outside, but he was firm in his heart.
The Ministry of Jai Jawan Jai Kishan was an introducer of his great personality.
During the last one and a half years, he has given the mantra to reach the height of the achievements of the youth and the farmers of the country, which is the result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate sanitation work with children in Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school where the foundation was laid by the revered father himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups and Corporate Worlds have given a large scale sanitation work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Come on, let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Satan Singh.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but also in the world, which everyone is discussing.
This time India is going to organise the worlds largest Swachhata Sammelan - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officers from the Ministry of Cleanliness and experts from all over the world will come and share the experiences and experiments related to cleanliness.
It is imperative to ensure freedom, peace and justice to the exploited, suffered and deprived.
Inspired by his thinking, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on 12th October, 1997.
NHRC will complete 15 years in a few days.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also helped in enhancing the spiritual pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights have no foreign idea.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideal principles of the Vedic period, "SabkaBhavantuSukhin:".
NHRC has made widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its use.
The Commission has created an environment of hope and trust among the people of the country on a journey of 15 years.
I think this is a healthy society, very optimistic for democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up at the National Level on Human Rights.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
This year also, we are trying to organise Run for Unity in our villages, in Ganj, in cities, in Mahanagar.
This is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country forever.
I urge all of you that on 31st October, through Run for Unity, we strengthen this effort to bind every section of society and every person in a sense of unity and that will be the best tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for this sacred festival of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating the Rakshabandhan Festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of this place.
This festival of Rakhibandhan is a symbol of love and trust of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many events in the history of the country when it has been seen that how a security forces have linked the people of both the states or the people of different religions with faith.
Just a few days later.
The winds of the sky will be heard by the horse sail-ki-jay Kanhaiya Red-ki and Gobind-Govinda.
It's a different joy to swimming in the color of Krishna.
Children have also started organizing Tehri-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I'm grateful to Chinmayi for taking care of this.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I also congratulate those people who have been working to save this great heritage, take it forward and reach the people.
Every language has its own significance.
In every field of life, there is a huge treasure of knowledge in Sanskrit languages and literature.
Whether it is science or technological knowledge, agriculture or health, science or architecture, bank or management, economists or environment, the Ministry of Home Affairs is also in detail in detail to fight against challenges like global warming.
You all will be happy to know that all the people of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit language as a medium of interaction today.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which an infinite word can be produced.
If we want to weigh something, we use English quotations, sometimes we call pockets etc.
But those who know with the words of Sanskrit, they know how low the words can be explained through these defined words of Sanskrit.
"Economy, if a Guru gives his disciplinary knowledge to his disciplinary, then there is no such thing or wealth all over the world to lend the disciplinary teacher.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always recall the great philosopher and former President of India, Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
On his birth anniversary, academic day is celebrated across the country.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teacher's Day and also recall his dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the rain brings good news for those who work hard.
How many days ago we have seen how the floods have caused the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come to Kerala.
I convey my deepest condolences to those families who have lost their loved ones in this disaster.
I would like to assure all those bereaved families that 125 crore Indians have been with you in the shoulder to shoulder.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity should recover quickly.
I am confident that the life of Kerala will become easier by filling with indomitable energy and courage.
The way the disaster ruins life, it is unfortunate, but in these days, we regain the religion of humanity.
Every person from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is trying his best to make the lives of any district or region in Kerala or in India.
The people of all ages and those associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their help.
Everyone is wondering how the sufferings of the people of Kerala can be shared so that it can be tragic.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the heroes of this disaster rescue operation in Kerala.
They took all the way to save the victims.
The Air Force, Navy or Army, BSF, C-I-SF, and A-F have been forced to reach rescue operations and rescue operations.
I specially want to mention the hard work of NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked to tackle these hazards is commendable.
The capability of NDRF, their obligation and speedy decision-making have created a honourable seat for all the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, this time, I have come to read the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat and the most people have written about this thing is Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziabad, Welcome from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banarajee from West Bengal, Akhilash Pand from Katihar in Bihar, and many others asked me to tell about the various aspects of Atal ji's life in the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On 16th August, people of the country and the world have received the message of Atal ji's death.
He was a leader who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and had gone far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He wouldn't have seen special news.
The affection, reverence and condolences of all for Atal ji are indicative of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I want to tell you about one more example of Atal ji's great personality. It is his political culture that he has tried to bring about changes in the political culture and the efforts of the political culture to provide affordable infrastructure will have a lot of benefits in the country and in the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 21st Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings about two important changes in the politics of our country.
The first is to limit the Ministers of States to fifteen percent of the total seats in the Assembly.
Atal ji brought about a change in this system, which enhances the efficiency and efficiency of the money and wealth.
Atal ji was the only visionary who transformed the situation and made the state healthy and smooth.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji replaced the budget from five o'clock in the evening.
Another freedom we have achieved during Atal ji's work through the creation of Indian flag code.
It seems from 1972, which would lead to the tricolor movement at public places.
Common Indians get the opportunity to hoist the National Flag.
In this way he brought our lifelong tricolor to the people.
You have seen how Atal ji has transformed the polling process and strengthened the country by taking brave steps in the elections.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is a contradiction and hypocrisy, but when something good happens, there is no special discussion about it.
A few days ago, the session of Parliament was concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
The result of this was that the Lok Sabha 21 and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills.
This change session of Parliament will be reminded of social justice and youth.
In this session, how many important bills have been passed to improve the youth and backward classes.
You all know, for centuries, OBC commissions like SCST Commission were being set up.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the commitment of the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
This initiative will help in achieving the objectives of social justice.
The session also commenced the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of SC and ST citizens.
It will protect them from the atrocities and increase their faith.
The civilization of the country cannot harm any kind of injustice.
The offenders of this crime will be punished for at least 10 years, if the girls below 12 years of age are punished, they will be punished.
A few days ago, you might have been in the newspaper, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, has been sentenced to two blame for slaughtering a girl after hearing only two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh was sentenced to five days after hearing the culprits.
A court in Rajasthan also gave such a quick opinion.
The Act will play a vital role in resolving the cases of crime against women and girls.
Financial progress without social change is incomplete.
The 'Three Talaq' Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, though it is not possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha and I want to assure Muslim women that the entire country is with all the power to justify them.
When we come forward to protect the interests of the country, we can change the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived.
In this interaction, everybody has shown an ideal together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, at this moment, the vision of millions of countrymen is committed to the Asian edition organised in Jakarta.
Every morning, in newspapers, television, news, social media, an Indian player has won medals.
Asian games are still going on.
I congratulate all those who have won the medal for the country.
I extend my best wishes to those who are still in the competition.
Our sportspersons, especially Shooting and Wrestling, are very good. Our sportspersons are also bringing medals in all the games that we have not been able to play before.
This is not just medal, it is a testimony to the courage to touch Indian sports and Indian competitors and their dreams.
The number of our daughters in the list of medal winners for the country is a positive one.
Many of the youth who have won the medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won the medals have emerged from the unknowing villages and catastrophe and have worked hard.
On 29th August, we will celebrate the National Sports Day, I convey my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay homage to Hockey's magician great player Shri Dhan Chand ji.
My request to all the citizens of the country, you all play and look at your fitness, because a healthy India will create a rich and prosperous India.
When India is fit, India will build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of Asian Games and also congratulate the rest of the players for their best results.
But the Vrihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable coordination of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everyone was surprised to see Rani Ki Bao of the eleventh century in Patan, Gujarat.
India is always an engineering experiment.
There are many engineers born in India who have imagined unimaginable and have made examples of the great achievements of the Engineering world.
Our great engineers have a treasure of heritage, whose work is still surprised to the people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he is not only supreme but also the rest of the country remembers him with great pride and respect.
His memory is celebrated on 15th September as the Engineers' Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity in the East.
I recall that in 2001, the terrible earthquake of Kutch in Gujarat had happened in terms of the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world.
He was joking to see me, see this is my house.
It's Bhunga in Kachchh.
My house has seen three earthquakes.
He was saying this with great pride, and I believe that even a long time ago, the engineers of that time used to build houses in the local environment and conditions, which would save people.
Now when we celebrate the Engineer's Day, we have to think about the future and organise workshops at different places.
We have to think of changing things, do we have to learn new things
You have to teach me
The whole world is fighting with natural disasters.
What will be the new use of stractural engineering here
What's his course
What should the students teach
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this idea.
I'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
He inspired the thoughts of the people.
You must have seen on TV that a group of 12 young football players and their coaches went to a cave in Thailand.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But on that day Bhagya Devi had a different desire.
When they entered the cave, a lot of water accumulates in the cave due to sudden rains.
All efforts are being made to know where those kids are, how they are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole incident in a different way.
The government there has shown the behaviour of peace and patience to everybody like parents, family members, media and citizens of the country.
All teams have joined this mission.
I think it's a matter of learning and health.
My parents weren't sorry or she didn't put water to her eyes.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the peaceful use of the entire society is a lesson for us.
In this operation, a soldier from the Thailand Navy had to die.
The whole world is surprised that despite such a dangerous situation, the rescuers have worked with courage and patience in the humid dark cave.
This event shows that when people are united, there are many wonderful things.
It is necessary that we focus on our goals and work for it in a quiet mind.
A few days ago, the popular poet of our country, Neeraj, has tried.
The specialty of poet Neeraj was hope, trust, firm commitment and confidence.
All the words of poet Nirj can inspire all our Indians.
He wrote, "And the darkness will be removed as soon as the light is lighted, the darkness will be removed.
The month of July and August is very important for the farmers and all the youth.
This is because this is the time when a pic session is for colleges.
Like truth, millions of young people get out of school and go to college.
The month of February and March is enjoyed on holidays in April and May and spends on enjoying the results, synergies of future life and career choices.
July is the month when the youngsters walk on the path of their lives and when the focus moves away from the quote of Cut-off.
The focus of the students goes from home to hostel.
The students enter the rooftop of the Pents from the rooftop of Professors.
I believe that my young friends are very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, get out of the house, go out of the village, get out of a safe environment and become yourself a guide.
All these youngsters left their homes and took their lives forward in a new way.
There's nothing to do with books, reading must be done, but we have to keep looking for new things.
Old friends are precious.
Those youngsters who have left their homes and are going to read somewhere else, find out the place, know about the people there, language and culture.
My best wishes to all the youngsters.
Her dad's been wasting the slaughterhouse and feeding the family.
I congratulate Ashram for his success in that situation.
There are so many afflicted families who have shown their hard work and attention in adverse conditions that inspire all of us.
Prince Kumar of Delhi, his father, DTC, or Abhay Gupta, who has studied under the light of the road, is Ahmedabad's daughter, Afreen Shek, whose father Auto Challan, daughter Khushi, school driver of Nagpur, Kartik, son of Haryana Chowkidar, or Ramesh Sahu, son of the brick-woman of Jharkhand.
From the birth of Anushka Pand, a genetic disease named Spinal Mascular Autopsy, all of them have achieved success in crossing all obstacles in their determination and hearts.
How many examples we'll find around us.
Any good incident in any corner of the country inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a news appeared to me in which it was written, "Modi's dreams were fulfilled by two youths.
After reading the information inside, I came to know how our youth is trying to transform the lives of the common man through technology smart and creative usage.
Once I had asked the Indian youth to think about how to use their talent for India and take time out.
I had requested to change Brain-Drain into Brain Gain.
Two I-T professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have adopted this challenge and have made an innovative effort.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have created a Smart Gram App using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the village with the world, but now they will get any information or news on their mobile.
The App provides telephone directory, News Sakshan, Events List, Health Centre and Normation Centre.
The App is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate in Kisans is working in the market to sell their products from one side.
Thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, the pious journey of Pindrapur is a wonderful festival.
Friends, On 23rd July this year, the eleventh of the month of ASHAD, the pilgrimage of Pindharpur is celebrated with a joy.
Pindharpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
The saints like Saint Jnaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are driven to Paduka Palki and to dancing in the name of Bitthal Bhagwan to Padurpur.
Bhagwan Bitthal, who is also called Bitthova or Pandurang, devotees reach there for his visit.
Lord Bittal preserved the interests of the poor, the helpless, the suffering.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion to this God.
You have to go to the Vithoba Temple of Pt. Thiruvananthapuram, there is a different feeling of greatness, beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the listeners of the Mann Ki Baat programme, if the opportunity comes, you will surely get the experience of the pilgrimage to Udaipur.
Innumerable fans like Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still teaching people in Maharashtra.
We have instructions of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them, such as Varud or Abhang.
We can fight against the blind beliefs, we can get this mantra from them.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the old evils are removed from the society and have brought compassion, compassion and goodness among the people.
Just like this was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who has made a deep impression in the minds of many Indians.
We recall Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July, and on his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave in courage and confidence.
He had the ability to misunderstand the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he had been accused of treason three-three times in twenty years.
I am telling you about a special incident about the statue of Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, think that 100 years ago, more than forty thousand people had joined him to welcome him.
He also decided to set up a memorial of the Great Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain, as mayor of the City Corporation.
The British rulers are naturally unhappy about this and the Collectors there are repeatedly proposing to build a memorial named Smaru Hela.
But Sardar Saheb, if needed, he would resign but he would leave the memorial statue of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, on 28th February, 1929, he invited Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate the statue of Sardar Patel.
On the occasion of the Maha-Uddhana, Bapu had said that the Ahmedabad Municipal Council has not only received a person as a mayor, but also a power that has made the statue of Tilak possible.
My dear countrymen, one of the special features of the statues that were set up by Sardar Patel is the foundation of Lokmanya Tilak ji in the chair.
The English had to hear this writing as God's instructions.
The first public Ganesh Festival was inaugurated by Lokmanya Tilak.
Even when the public Ganesh Festival was rich in traditional respect and organisations, the society became an effective medium of creating awareness, unity, equality and equality.
Now Ganesh Mandap is seen in the streets of any city.
The Ganesh Festival is organised by all the families of that street together.
This is a unique opportunity for our youth to achieve special capabilities like organisations and leadersships and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said last time that today I am recalling Lokmanya Tilak ji, you must celebrate Ganesh Festival with a lot of fervor but celebrate the festival.
Ganesh ji's idol should be his decoration and puja materials.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are some youngsters in India who cannot be inspired by listening to this language.
The bravery of Chandrashekhar ji was inspired by many youngsters for freedom.
Azad kept his life alive but never before the foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute two great children of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, in the 20th World Athletics Celebrations held in Finland, India's external daughter, Kisankana Hima Das, won the Gold.
Ekta, another daughter of the country, has e-mailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter and is now preparing for the Asian Games there.
The e-mail is integrating, "Mahendrakhan in the life of an athlete when he lays the thread and I am proud that I have shown it.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
His success is due to the fact that he has made his challenges a medium of success.
In 2003, the unity in the road accident was ruined by the bottom of the body, but this girl didn't lose courage and strengthened herself and reached her goal.
I congratulate Ekta Bhayan ji, Yogesh Katunia ji and Sundar Singh ji for their courage and courage.
You go ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, many incidents of history in the month of August are full of festivals, but sometimes diseases also enter the house for weather.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for your good health, for this next month and for many festivals that have come for centuries.
We will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, on this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, you all have the privilege of being face to face with you.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
You might have understood that I am talking about the test matches between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international test match and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides have shown great sports capabilities in this match.
An Afghan President, Shri Ashraf Ghani, who had played a very good role in the IP-L this year, wrote to me in his Twitter: "Afghanistan people are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sports talent.
The best of Afghanistan, Rashid represented him.
He's a wealth in the world of Cricket, and he's a little funny and wrote, "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match will be remembered to all of us.
Though this was the first match, it is natural to remember, but this match will be remembered for another thing.
The Indian team has done a job that is unprecedented all over the world.
While taking the Indian team, a wonderful team has shown what to do.
While taking the Indian team, the Afghan team invites those who are playing international matches for the first time and calls them together.
What can be the Sportsman Spirit and Sportsmanship
The best way to find out the talent in the sports community and the achievements of our youth.
I don't wish two teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, on 21st June this 4th Yoga Day, there was an unprecedented view.
Be it the Brazil-European Parliament or the United Nations Headquarters located in New York, the Japanese Navy's warrior ship, people are doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga was organised and I am told that many of the asanas have been demonstrated by women.
The soldiers of India and China have worked together on the high snow peaks of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with so much enthusiasm then why would it not be encouraged in India
Our soldiers of the Air Force have pillared everybody by placing yoga at a height of 15000 feet from the ground in the sky.
There was a sight, they didn't sit in the air, they were swinging in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, yoga has been done everywhere.
There was a magnificent sight of Ahmedabad, where around 750 oppressed brothers and sisters made records by doing yoga at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as Aquelence and Revolution.
One of the wellness efforts is being carried out by Yoga, I hope it will move forward.
Gradually, many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
Did you go to this place, Kabir Das ji
The economically impressed sage is the one who can know the sorrows of others.
Those who don't understand the sufferings of others, he's desperate.
Kabir Das ji stressed on social harmony.
"Jagam Very Koi Nehi, the mind is cold.
Yeah, give me pulses, please.
Kabir Das ji says, "Where is the religion, where it is sin.
Her valuable words have an impact even today. Now when we talk about Saint poet Kabir Das ji, he recalls his fault.
This is the greatness of the Guru and such a Guru is Jagatguru, Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown the path of truth to millions of people, who have been inspiring people since time to come.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated in 2019.
There is another history that is associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the terrible event of Jallianwala Bagh, which is going to be completed for 100 years, was the incident that ruined humanity.
On 13th April, 1919, somebody forgot the black day when all the boundaries of ineffectiveness by using energy were killed on innocent, innocent and innocent people.
The 100th year of this memorable event is going to be completed, but we will always remember the eternal message given by this event, it is that no problem can be solved through violence and losses.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always successful.
My dear countrymen, Dr. Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi, wrote on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July.
Ramanji, thank you very much first
It is very happy to see your interest in the history of India.
You know, on June 23 last year, Dr.
Perhaps very few people know that in 1937, Dr.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at the convocation of Gurudev Tagore University of Kolkata, in the invitation of Shyamaprasad Mukherjee.
This was the first example when somebody interacted with the University of Calcutta in Bengal during the British rule.
From 1947 to 1990, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in a sense, Indias entrepreneurship and a strong foundation stone of Indias progress was laid on a strong foundation and platform.
In 1996, the first industrial system of independent India was based on its plans and vision.
Dr.
The dream of Mukherji was that India would be self-reliant, better and prosperous in every sector of the industry.
He said that India will build a big industry and also focus on MSMEs, cotton, textiles and cotton industry.
He is a finance and organisation set-up for the smooth development of cottage industry and micro-industries, in which all II between 1990 and 1990.
Shema Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the development of West Bengal.
Her thoughts, contemplations and activity have saved a part of West Bengal and is still part of India.
Come, let us recall the message of this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and through harmony and brotherhood, we continue to take India forward.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to all those people who have benefitted from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to come out of the file and hear from the faces of the people.
People have said their commitments, joy and grief.
I believe that this was not merely a government programme, but it was another kind of learning experiment, and what could be more satisfactory than I have seen in the eyes of the people at this time
When I used to hear a common man, his simple words, his speeches, his own feelings, he would have touched the heart.
I knew how the girls from the remote villages are helping in making passports from the village old people, pensions to the common man.
Millions of youngsters of Jharkhand, like Jan Aushadhi, are going to the surrounding villages and providing affordable medicines.
The youngsters in West Bengal, who were looking for jobs two-three years ago, are not only doing their jobs successfully but also providing jobs to 10-15 people.
The students of Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as West Management at the Tinkering Lab of the school at a short age.
There were stories of such experiences, there was no corner of the country from where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that in the entire event, I have experienced the strength of the people from the success of the government, the strength of the country and the strength of the dream of a New India and the strength of the resolve.
There are some people in the society who don't talk about disappointment, don't work to build confidence, don't find ways to break instead of rocks, they don't get peace.
In such a situation, when the common man speaks of the achievements of his life with a new hope, a new enthusiasm, his success is not the government.
Kahini, a small girl from a far-flung village, also inspires 125 crore people.
I'm grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people have been associated with this video bridge and have given me a new energy.
I once again express gratitude to you.
I also felt this smell of good.
It is a matter of fact that the corporate professionals of Bangalore have jointly created an Ease of Doing Business Trust and have activated this Trust to double the income of the farmers.
They have been connected to the farmers, have constructed schemes and how to increase the income of the farmers.
The training is being given to the farmers, engineers and technologists through this trust, how to harvest organic farming with new methods of farming and how to yield crops as well as other crops.
The farmers who were previously dependent on only one crop so that the crops were not good and the benefits were not so, today they are not only harvesting many crops but also getting good profits by making the right marketing of the crops through this Trust.
Fruits will be good only when good species of seeds are used for this, separately made seed bank.
Women are working to take care of this Seed Bank and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST system is going to be completed.
The dream of one nation one tax was fulfilled today.
If I have to give credit to anyone for this system, then I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a beautiful example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the States have decided to take into account the welfare of the country and that is why such a big tax reform system has been implemented in the country.
Till now, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken so far, despite the presence of representatives of different political ideologies and representatives of different states, including individual priorities.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST, but after the implementation of this system, the same tax system is now available across the country.
Once GST comes, check posts have been closed and it has increased the speed of transportation of goods and other goods, which not only saved time but also benefits in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the world's largest tax reform system.
Such a big tax reform has been successful in India because the people of the country have adopted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that it takes 5 to 7 years to be properly implemented in such a large country with such a large population.
But the zeal of the true countrymen, the flow of the country's heritage and the participation of the people is the result of this that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, it has been established and it has been revising itself through the needed infrastructure.
This is a great success that has achieved 125 crore Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember, a team of six women commanders of the navy has been travelling over the past few months.
I want to say something about the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The teams of these six daughters of India returned to India on May 21, 2019 through more than 250 days I-NSV Tarini and warmly welcomed them all over the world.
Several oceans and some oceans have crossed about 22,000 nautical distances.
It's an unprecedented incident all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these daughters, listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for their brave work, for enhancing the talent of the navy, for enhancing India's honour and especially for the daughters of India's no less than any part of the world.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information has been found about Mount Everest-Jai people.
On 16th May, five tribal students from Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisa Dhure, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soam - have won the worlds highest horizon.
They were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh Ladakh from August 2017.
They were selected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning the Everest with the help of the name, they brightened the name of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, sixteen-year-old Shivangi Pathak won Everest as the youngest Indian woman in Nepal.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest won the first father-son's couple.
Not only the youth are winning Everest, but on May 19, 50, Smt. Sangeeta Behl also won Everest.
Some of the Everest ascendants are not only skilled but also experienced.
This work is not only commendable, but also reflects their obligations towards cleanliness and environment.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave heroes, especially to the daughters.
A large number of people from different fields will come forward to support this thing.
On the occasion of Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
In social media, people are sharing the video of their Fitness Challenge and making them challenges by tagging others.
I believe that this is a very good process and this kind of challenge inspires us to keep ourselves fit and to fit others.
My dear countrymen, many times you have heard something about playing from me, sportspersons.
"Thank you very much, Jadavji, for your phone
These games were part of the summer vacations.
There are two traditional games.
There's an outdoor and there's an indoor.
The unity among the diversity of our country may be seen somewhere in these games.
The same game is known as different places.
It is sportsperson or leopard breeding or bucket playing at the Square Board of 8 by 8.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu and Changpo in Rajasthan.
Even if the people of different states don't know each other's language, they look at the time of playing.
That's the game that looks everywhere in the village-urban.
It is also known as different parts of the country.
It is known as the entire fort in Andhra Pradesh or the Karavilla.
It is called Shootbari in Odisha, and in Maharashtra it is called Bittidalu.
Traditional sports are being created, which helps us in enhancing physical ability and enhancing our physical thrilling, concentration, awareness and fostering.
These are not only sports, they teach the values of our lives, aim to achieve the goals, to create a team spirit, to help each other.
A few days ago, I was watching that our traditional sportspersons have been included in the training programmes of Business Management for development of integral personality and improvement of personal skills.
At the same time, we are committed to our culture and traditions.
Some games make us aware of society, environment etc.
Now school, school and youth should come forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum of our heritage games.
This game can be made to show how to play the rules of the game.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow.
This is the theme Beat Plastic Pollution.
Understanding the importance of my request to you, we all ensure that we don't use polythene, low-grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic polyusion on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge you to see all the information from the World Environment Day Website India 2018 and try to use it in my daily life.
The loss of lives, the loss of wealth.
This is the result of the change in the Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, the COP 21 and Paris Agreement, we have collected the world through the International Solar Alliance, a good idea of fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this Environment Day, we think, what can we do to make this world more clean and green
How can I move forward on this path, what innovation can I do
It's raining.
Now we can plant a record number of trees, not only planting, it is important to take care of it until the tree grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You all remember on 21st June, not just you and me, the whole world remembers 21st June.
Today, 21st June is celebrated worldwide as International Day of Yoga and it is unanimously accepted that a few months ago, the preparations for the event started.
It is reported that preparations are going on to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga all over the world.
Yoga enhances the courage that always protects us like a prince.
Forgiveness arises as the mother feels for her own child, mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartihari said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is that our children, our brothers, our brothers, our self-confidence, our beds and knowledge work to finish our hungry.
Whenever anybody belongs to such qualities, it is natural that this Yogi wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge all the citizens to take forward the great heritage of Yoga and create a healthy, comfortable and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today on 27th May, India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's birth anniversary.
I salute Panditji.
In May 1857, Indians introduced their energy to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were embarrassed against injustice.
Sorry, we have been calling the incident of 1857 just rebellion or rebellion for a long time.
He didn't just show the incident, but there was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This Veer Savarkar wrote that what happened in 1857 was not an electric but the first war of independence.
The heroes of India House in London celebrated their fiftyth birth anniversary with Savarkar.
He was a servant of both weapons and scriptures.
Veer Savarkar, originally known for his struggle against the brave and British kingdom.
Besides this, he was also a remarkable poet and a social reformer who has always stressed on goodwill and unity.
There is a wonderful description about Savarkar ji, our dear, respectable Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Savarkar is carrying both poetry and revolution.
He was a brave poet, as well as a brave poet.
Our daughters, who had once been forced to visit the houses and houses from the grasshopper stupas, are learning the work of Salai and laying down the coverage of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and trust.
They have shown that if you are enthusiastic and are grateful for that, you can achieve success in all the difficulties and this is not just a matter of concern, but in every corner of India you can see it.
Your neighbours will see how people are suppressing the problem.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we get satisfaction by eating tea there, some people also have discussions and analysis.
These discussions are political, social, films, sportspersons, problems of the country, such a problem should be solved, but most of the discussions are limited to discussions.
He organised education, health and diet for all children coming to school.
He burst the darkness of his life.
I don't know who this sensitivity is, but I have shown it to you.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and the entire country.
There will be a lot of inspirational events around you.
There may be a lot of incidents.
Come on, let's take the positive mindset forward.
It's so hot in June that people wait for rains and hope for the clouds of the sky.
Some time from today, people will also wait for the moon.
Looking at the moon means the epilepsy.
On the occasion of Ramadan, a month's fast marks the commencement of the festival.
My belief is that this festival will be celebrated with a honour, especially in children.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the ties of our society.
I don't wish everyone a lot.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018

The whole country has seen this game.
The sportspersons participating in the games have come from small towns from different parts of the country.
We've reached this place across a lot of obstacles.
Today, the achievements that they have achieved, their parents, parents, coaches, other helpers, schools, teachers or school environment have played an important role in this journey.
They also have the role of friends who have raised the mindset of the players in all the situations.
Together with the players, I thank all of them, I congratulate them.
Genetic gentlemen, Shri Shashikant Bhosle wrote a picture of his swimming pool, My body is my weapon, my basic substance water, my world is swimming.
Another, I am feeling happy and healthy by roaming around Roma Devnath.
He said, "Fitness brings laugh, when we're happy, we'll laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness or happiness is fitness.
Fucking leopards have written a picture of their trekking.
For me traveling and trekking is a fit India.
It is heartening to see that many people are also encouraging our youth for fit India in an attractive manner.
The filmmaker gave a video on Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll also see it.
He said this exercise is very beneficial for stomach and back muscles.
I think this kind of movement is beneficial for all of us, for the entire country.
You're getting ready too.
On 21st June, the importance of International Yoga Day has now been accepted by the entire world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or in the world to keep Yoga inclusive, inclusive and physical development, and to normalize mental conditions.
You might have seen an animated video, where I was shown.
I am grateful to the analysts for taking care of this thing.
My young friends, you all are coming out of the map of testing and testing.
I want to invite you to a new work today.
I have seen that many youths are spending time to learn something new.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live a new life from the paper-column, the computer.
My young friends, I would urge you today for a special internship, three-four Ministries of the Government of India such as Sports, Human Resource Development and Drinking Water Department.
All those who have worked very well in colleges and universities will be awarded at the national level and those who have been successfully awarded to me.
I once again invite students and young friends to join the Internship.
I hope that our youth will take the Swachhta movement forward.
I want to know about all your efforts.

See how many people of different parts of the country are working and how good they are talking about.
A few days ago, I was watching that some young people from Delhi are falling unconsciously poor children, these youngsters have started a joke for the education of the guides and children of Delhi.
Initially, he explained to the beggars of the roads and the young boys who worked in the field of development.
The programme, which started with 15 children of the settlement near Gita Colony, Delhi, has become a part of studying two thousand children at 12 places in the capital today.
In this campaign, young teachers are making efforts to transform society by extracting two hours free times from their daily busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some of the farmers of Uttarakhand have shown inspiration to the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their fate but also changed their fate.
Crops, pulses, pulses, jaws are cultivated in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
The farmers were not able to afford their crops because of the hilly areas, but the farmers of the competitive territory had made their crops a road to the value addition and the loss of their crops directly in the market.
They're making biscuits from the field crops and selling that biscuit.
These farmers have created a government institution in Munnar and have opened bakery of biscuits.
On seeing the efforts of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit spread to nearly 50 Anganwadi centres of Bagheshwar district, even to Kosani Almora.
With this effort of farmers, the turnover of the company has not only reached 10 to 15 lakhs, but more than 900 families have been provided with foodgrains.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard that there will be war for water in the coming days.
Everyone says, but we don't have any responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
I don't want to read books, so there is no need to know any particular language.
In the past, our ancestors have shown it.
They highlighted the importance of every drop of water.
They have made new ways to save every drop of water.
You will see somebody going to Tamil Nadu, in many temples there are inscriptions related to water conservation, water conservation, drainage etc.
In the temples of Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilpatti and Pudukottai, large inscriptions are seen.
Even today, many bourgeoisie i. e. Step Wells are known as tourist destinations, but in fact, they are a vivid proof of the water conservation efforts of our ancestors.
You must go to Rajasthan to see the moon bourgeoisie of Jodhpur.
This is Indias largest and most beautiful bourgeoisie and one thing we have to remember is the largest bourgeoisie in the region where water is very strong.
Water conservation work will be as effective as the best time for water conservation in April, May and June-July.
The Manrega budget can be spent on water conservation.
In the last three years, many efforts are being made to conserve and build water conservation.
Every year about 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent in the Manrega budget for water conservation and water conservation.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of 64 thousand crore rupees, 55 percent of the total live storage capacity of these reservoirs is around 35 thousand crore rupees.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture has been benefitted through this water conservation and water conservation system.
This work has been done in the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I will say that April, May, June and July are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat comes, news comes from all over the country, letters come, phones come.
But the Philosophy that can survive with the peaceful, beautyful and integrity of Tagore's award winner Tagore does not know anything about it.
Please tell you at the Mann Ki Baat event so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he had a unique impression on all things, Tagore was a talented personality, a strange personality, but he had a teacher in him.
He wrote in Geetanjali: "He who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students", that is, who is, he has the responsibility to share the knowledge with the writers.
The integral meaning to keep a day is that when the man is untouched by himself, he can feel hungry.
When he's thirsty, he's feeling thirsty.
This is the time to remember the teachings and messages of the Prophet Mohammed.
The education of his life enables us to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once asked a Prophet Saheb, "What is the best thing in Islam
The Prophet said, To feed somebody poor and deprived, and to maintain harmony with everyone without knowing.
Prophet Mohammed was a trustee in knowledge and compassion.
He didn't care about anything.
He used to say, hostility is the one who demonstrates knowledge.
The Prophet Mohammed believed that if someone has something more than required, then you will give it to someone who needs it.
In this holy month, everybody gave a donation to the poor.
Prophet Mohammed believed that the person's sacred soul was not rich.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud that India is a nation of great Lord Buddha, who has guided millions of people across the world, the statue of compassion, service and sacrifice.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of his efforts, commitments and the great responsibility of walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of peace, goodwill and brotherhood.
This is the human values that the world needs most today.
Dad, Dad.
Ambedkar was very inspiring that he had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be read to be imprisoned in three words
Whether the people of the country are afflicted, suffered, exploited or deprived, Baba Saheb has empowered the people of this territory through the Constitution.
There's no more example than Karuna.
Lord Buddha's compassion for human sufferings was one of his greatest qualities.
We all of Asians have received the educational inheritance of Lord Buddha.
In many countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, this tradition of Buddha is also connected to the rocks there and that is why we are building the infrastructure of Buddhist tourism which connects important places of South-East Asia to the top Buddhist regions of India.
Blessings to those great men for the entire world, so that we can take our responsibility in creating a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today, we recall Lord Buddha, you must have heard of the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to have brought the privilege of Lafing Buddha, but very few people know that this compassion is also associated with an important event in the history of Indias security.
You may be wondering what is the relationship between the Lafing Buddha and the Indian Army.
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of May 11, 1998, the then Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, had made a statement to the countrymen, who had commended the entire country in the message of pride, pride and joy.
A new self-confidence was awakened among the people of New India, spread across the world.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
Nuclear tests were conducted on 11th May, 1998 in Pokhran, Rajasthan, West Bank of India.
This test was done on the day of Buddha Purnima on the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias tests were successful and on one hand, India was capable of exhibiting its strength in science and technology.
We can say that day is marked as a day of exhibition of his military power in India's history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
In this way, when you can become a country, you can also live peacefully with everyone.
The month of May, 1997 is not only important that atomic tests were conducted in that month, but the way it was done is more important.
The event showed the world that India has the capability to reach new goals and heights by keeping the great scientists their own land and a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Science.
Today, when we are going to celebrate on 11th May, 1994, we have to move ahead with the vision of Atal ji's Jai Vigyan for India's growth, we have to go ahead with the vision of building a modern India.
We have to make our energy a part of India's energy.
And then we will be able to get a new joy and a new satisfaction to take the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk to you once again in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, delegates from the ASEAN group came here and brought various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them were present before us the Ramayana.
That is, not only in India but also in the ASEAN group countries in the world, the inspiration and impact of Ram and Ramayana is the same even today.
My dear countrymen, every time I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you.
I have read what I have written in MyGov about launching the online course of Komal Cold Culture.
I am glad to see your passion towards Sanskrit as an IT worker.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about this.
I also urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to think about how to take forward this proposal of Komal Chakra.
On the Narendra Modi App, I have read the opinion of Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barakkar village of Nalanda district of Bihar.
The concern that you have expressed in terms of decreasing ground water level is very important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every creature living in this land.
You have requested to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I've reached all the listeners friends.
Addressing the gathering, Shri Yogesh Bhadresha said, I would like to say something about the health of the youth.
He said that our youth are physically weaker than other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the President of France had gone to Kashi and Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi wrote that all the scenes of that journey have touched his heart and inspired him.
He expressed his interest that the pictures should be published in video social media.
The Government of India shared all the pictures on social media and Narendra Modi App that day.
I want to tell all the children like Angha, Jaysh that when these letters are sent to them, my whole day's dragon, hard work gets over and over.
All these letters, so many phone calls, assumptions, I have heard of what I have read and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, distributed vacation plans, and in this summer, they thought of the surprisingness of animals and animals.
The farmers brothers and sisters have also sent a letter to me about the movement of Kisan Mela and farming across the country.
Some aware citizens have advised me about water conservation.
There are many letters about our festivals, our culture and traditions during the festival.
When I read the letters sent to you, I can know that a Rescueman from Karimganj, Assam, had made nine schools for the poor children filled with their own will, only then I can recognize the unparalleled will power of this country.
When I hear the words of Dr. Ajit Mohan Singh, a doctor from Kanpur, who roamed around the footpath and treated the footpaths and gave them free medicines, he is proud of the harmony and humanity of the country.
A year ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of a taxi driver Sayedul Lasker died.
Many such inspiring events indicate my country.
Today, the whole world looks at India.
Today, when India's name is higher with great pride, the birth of children and children of this country is hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, it will be very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
Because there are many letters related to farming.
This time I have seen the video of the DD Kisan channel that I have interacted with farmers friends and I believe that this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan should be seen by all the farmers and should use agricultural suggestions in their fields.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Charan Singh or Devilal ji, they were considered to be an important part of the economy and life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized the need for conservation of trees, pineapples, forests, etc.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of a comprehensive awakening of food and milk products to ensure better fertilizer, better settlement system for our farmers.
In his address in 1997, Shri Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our Mughal farmers have produced records in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have shown that if the goal is stable, there is complete self-confidence, if there is a commitment then everything can be done.
Today, technology has been associated with the hard work of the farmers.
This will give a lot of strength to agricultural producers.
In the letter that I have received, I have seen that many farmers friends have written about MSP and they want to talk to them in detail about this.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give the farmers the price of the crops.
It has been decided that MSP for specific crops will be at least one and a half times of investment.
Besides, there is a wide range of work on the Agricultural Marketing Reforms in the country to pay the farmers' crops.
The local market of the village, the picker market, which is connected to the world.
In order to ensure that the farmers do not have to go far to sell their products, it will be linked to APMC and e-NAM platforms by upgrading the required infrastructure of twenty thousand rural houses in the country.
This means that there is a system of connectivity with any market in the country from a single area.
My dear countrymen, this year the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi is being inaugurated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I would like to urge you to share your thoughts with all through MyGov.
What can be the logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier as the Ministry of Health.
Private health care is very cheap and easy.
It will be beneficial for all of us to be aware of the private health care.
The first duty to keep life healthy is cleanliness.
Besides, work is going on to build a Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world in the form of 'Preventive Health Care'.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
It is the result of all of us that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year, the International Day of Yoga is not left on 21st June and 100 days.
All the people from across the country and abroad participated in the last three International Day of Yoga with great enthusiasm.
We have to ensure that we join ourselves and encourage family members to join us.
In a new and innovative way, it is necessary to make Yoga popular among children, youth and adults, men or women.
Different events are being organised by TV and electronic media in the country.
But can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from now on to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of yoga, but I am a yoga habit.
Some people have made me a teacher of yoga through their own thoughts and have made me a 3D animated video of Yoga.
I want to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Be it healthcare or be it in the evening or be it cheap and affordable for the people, sufficient efforts are being made.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at a low cost.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart Stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knees has also been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the Government of India and insurance companies will be able to afford 5 lakh rupees per year for the treatment of nearly 10 crore families.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
Everybody needs your help to reach this awareness.
We all have to try together to get rid of tuberculosis.
A few years ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
He said that industrialization is a strong medium which will lead to the income of the poorest of the country.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamed: India will once be a strong centre of labour-culture.
Today, when the Make in India project is progressing in achieving success, his visionary is our inspiration.
Indias position in the world economy is now as a bright stream and the highest foreign investment is in India.
Global trade is now looking at India because we are now becoming the center of investment and new traditions.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply confident of self-reliance and self-reliance.
One person in the country should not live in poverty, Dr. Ambedkar should ask for this kind of thing.
He also believed that by donating the poor, the poor cannot be tackled.
Today, projects like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are creating young entrepreneurs in our country.
Like him, a visionary person had said that the rivers and valleys were envisaged by the Working Committee for water conservation and use.
Today, the historic development of waterways and ports has started in the country.
New ports and old ports are being built on different coasts of India.
In the decade of 1990s, when the world was second war, the cold war between the two powers and the stress of patriotism, Dr. Ambedkar envisaged the spirit of Team India or India.
He had understood the importance of federalism and that is why he felt that the Union and the States have to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we are focused on cooperative federalism at every level of the country-administration and the Ministry of Competitive Cooperation.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for a number of people like me.
India's essence is totally different: this is an India that is of Ambedkar, a poor, a backward person.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (Gram Swaraj Abhiyan) is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May, 2019 on the birth anniversary of Dr.
This campaign will be a part of rural development, poverty alleviation and social justice.
I urge you all to take part in this national campaign self-reliantly.
My dear countrymen, in a few days many festivals and festivals come: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Estar and Vaishali.
Remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir on Mahavir Jayanti.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, the propagator of non-violence, is inspiration for us.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
Eastern Elley reminds us of Jesus Christ, whoever desired humanity, peace, goodwill, justice, kindness and compassion.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen the colours of the sea look blue, but we know from your daily experience that there is no colour of water.
Did we ever think that the sea, the water becomes coloured
This question was remembered by a young man in the 1920s.
This question was given by a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the Best Workers on Light Scattering or radiation.
His discovery is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate the National Science Day on 28th February every year, because it is said that on this day he had discovered Light Scattering for which he was awarded the award.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana have been proud of India.
Satyendranath Bose, a well-known particle, has also been named Boson.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know that the extraordinary work in science is going on.
The Artificial Intelligence helps in creating a robot, butt and manufacturing machines.
Nowadays, through self-flarning, various machines are making their intellectuals more smart.
This technology can help improve the lives of the poor, the deprived and the helpless.
On this occasion of Artificial Intelligence, I would like to tell the scientists that what kind of artificial intelligence can be found to facilitate the ease of living for the brothers and sisters of Divyang
Can we get better opportunities for natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate healthcare
A few days ago, I had been interacting with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create event in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man said that he had made a digital instrument where if someone can't talk, then he would change in fear and you could talk like you were able to talk to a person.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Scientific and Technological Valueutral.
You're not attached to it.
Whatever machine we want to do is.
But it depends on us how we want to work from the machine.
Light Balb's innovator Tomas Alva Eddison has been unsuccessful in his work.
Once asked about this, he said, I have explored ten thousand ways of not creating light balloons, meaning Edison also made his disability his strength.
It is a matter of great privilege that today I have lived in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Arvind.
As an opponent, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, stood on the face of their rule.
In this way, he asked about every aspect of life like a great sage, found answers and guided humanity.
It's important to ask the truth again and again.
I congratulate all our scientists and scientists on National Science Day.
Friends, I got many messages about the safety and disaster during the crisis and people sent me something or the other.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, from Pune, has delivered his speech on the Accupational Safety on the Mobile App.
He writes that the software in our country is not better than the collaboration and construction work.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life , if we cannot raise security then it is even more difficult to ensure safety system during any major danger or disorder .
Most of the accidents will be seen if the natural trauma is removed, but the consequences of our fault.
If we are cautious, follow the required rules, we can save our lives and save our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several guidelines regarding safety in the field of work, but the rules are not followed at all.
I urge all the municipalities and cities that have fire brigades to go to school at least once in a week and take a muck drill before the students.
It will enable both the beneficiaries to be aware of the habits and to learn a lot of new generations.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) leads the entire country to fight corruption.
In order to train volunteers in cyclone or wildlife-productive districts, a scheme called Apda-Miracle has been launched.
Training and awareness are extremely important.
Till two-three years ago, thousands of people lose their lives every year in Lu or Heat Wave.
Since then, the NDMA organises a workshop on Heat Wave Resistance and campaigns to increase awareness.
We have good results in all the integrated initiatives.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to temperature flows declined unexpectedly to around 220.
It is understood from this that if we give importance to safety then only we can stay safe .
I would like to honour all those who are present at the spot in the moment when an accident takes place and helps the victims.
The number of heroes is not less.
Besides, the dangers are always present in the field and rescue services, the National Disaster Response Forces, the Para-Military Force and the brave soldiers of the Armed Forces who rescued others from the dangers of their lives.
A few days ago, India and other BIMSTEC countries, such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, participated in the Exercise led by India.
We all heard them many times.
But today, if someone takes our planes and asks about where things are, where the live jackets are kept, how to use it etc.
If we all become aware of our safety then the security of the society is also included in it .
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of Wasteto Wealth and Wasteo Energy through biogas in the village to create a Swachh Bharat.
The effort has begun and its name has been called GOBAR Dhan (Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources).
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean the villages and to generate income and energy by transforming the remaining waste in the field after cattle and cultivation into compounds and bio-gas.
The use of cattle cattle cattle and other biological ends in any European country and in its identity is to generate energy.
But it was not being fully used in India.
Including this in Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are moving towards this direction respectively.
The objectives of envisaging the production of bio-gas-based energy are to ensure that the livestock waste, waste after agricultural waste, waste of kitchen waste.
The Gobar-Dhan Yojana will encourage the farmers of rural India, rural brothers and sisters so that they see the waste and waste not only as the source of income.
The use of biogas in cooking and power generation will also increase self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
There will be new employment opportunities in the areas of waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
A online trading platform will be set up to facilitate the implementation of the Gobar Dhan scheme, which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right value of cow dung and agricultural waste.
I would like to urge the enthusiasts, especially the sisters living in the village, to come forward and make self-help groups, organise a subscribed committee to utilize this opportunity.
I invite you to come and join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs. Be entrepreneurs in this endeavour to transform the waste of your village into wealth and to create pomegranate money from the world.
But , in Raipur of Chhattisgarh we got to know about an unparalleled effort , and that is , the first ' Burjya Mahotsav ' organised in this state .
The Festival, organised by Raipur Nagar Nigam, was aimed at enhancing awareness about cleanliness, creativity of waste materials in the city and creating awareness about various methods of reuse of garbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Nagar , the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration there for showcasing the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a new way.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are various events in the country and the world .
On that day, women are honored with the award of ' Lady Shakti Puraskar' in the country who have done following work in different fields in the last few days.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development except for women's development.
Today, at this moment, my husband seems to be a word of Vivekananda.
Independence, this idea of Swamiji a hundred and 150 years ago demonstrates the feelings of women's strength in Indian culture.
Today, the responsibility of all of us is to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women's strength has given them self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have moved ahead and have taken the country and society forward and have worked to take it to a new height .
Finally our dream of a New India is that where women are equally participants in empowered , strong and inclusive development of the country .
A few days ago, a man gave me a pretty advice.
He suggested that on 8th March, a variety of events are being organised to celebrate Women's Day, but what can be done to honour the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-city
This number is not small : 15 lakh women have been organised for a month.
In this campaign starting from 26 January 2018 , in just 20 days , these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets .
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand Jal Sahia i. e.
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women 's strength is such a strength of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will change the cleanliness campaign in everyday life , reforms of cleanliness in the form of masses .
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching the News that electricity reached three villages of Elephanta Island after seventy years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm was shown to the people there.
You know, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am amazed to know that despite being such a big tourism centre in Mumbai, electricity has not reached Elephants even after so many years of independence.
For seventeen years, three villages of Elephanta Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Saintbandar, all the darkness that had lived in the lives of the people there have gone away and the light has come in their lives.
I congratulate the administration and people there.
I am glad that now Elephant village and Elephant Caves will be brightened in the light of electricity.
This is not just a power but a new swing in front of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago we have celebrated the Shivratri festival.
The importance of Holi festival is as important as the Holika Dahan, as a result of this, the evil is burned in fire and destroyed on this day.
On the day of Holi, sitting together in all the entertainments, enjoying each others happiness, joy - a beautiful moment and a festival of Holi - love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we have celebrated the Republic Day with enthusiasm.
The first time in history was that the top leaders of ten countries were present in the celebrations.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter to me on the Narendra Modi App.
He wrote that on February 15, 2018, the Day of Death was imagined.
He has always taken us off in the Columbia spacecraft accident but has inspired lakhs of youngsters in the world.
I express my gratitude to brother Prakash ji for introducing his long imagination of Chawla's farewell.
If you have a will and a firm commitment, if you are hungry to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several electrics have been successful in creating different parts of the country.
Lopamudra, Gargy, my friend. I don't know how many names
Today we talk about Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago, in our scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific exhibitions have been said: "Dashuputra, Samakna, Dasputrana Promotion.
This is the greatest significance in our society.
And that is why, women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This women's strength binds the entire country, all the society and the family with unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has made many more examples.
He wrote, Our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's "Sukhoi-30" warship will inspire him.
Three brave women have become drivers of Thamuna Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaurvedi warriors, who are currently training to run Sukoi-30 warriors.
Today there are many areas where women are living first and our women's strengths are showing something or the other.
It has also been added as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women have an important role in the ongoing positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women's empowerment. You might be thinking about what connectivity can be there.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all level workers are women.
Women workers in all sections.
Be it Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Observers, Authorities and Point Persons, more than 40 women workers are handling this station.
Today, our women's strength is leading from the front.
When the tribal women talk, a picture comes out in the minds of everyone, there will be a jungle, the hearts of the mountains and there will be a marked sight of the girls moving ahead in their heads.
But in Chhattisgarh, our tribal women have created a new picture in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is among the Maoist-affected areas.
violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols have created a terrible environment there.
The tribal women living in such a tragic situation are making themselves self-reliant by running e-rickshaws.
Within a very short time, all the women from there have participated in this process.
On the one hand, they are empowering themselves through self-employment and also changing the pictures of the Maoist-affected areas.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special strength to the environmental protection.
I also compliment the district administration and the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women from granting to training.
We are repeatedly listening, people say, "Anything that doesn't lose our existence.
Whatever the negative expedition, it is forbidden to follow the reforms required.
And the specialty of our society is to continue the sustainable process of self-reform.
The identity of any vibrant society is in its self-reform process.
For centuries, efforts against social evils and misconducts have been going on in our country personally and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts are being made to create awareness against social curse such as child marriage and Panprath.
He was sworn in in the state to fight corruption like Panprath and daughter-in-law.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and inspiring youth, mothers and sisters, all have quieted themselves in this fight.
From the historical Gandhi Maidan of Patna to the border of the state this human chain continued to be connected very closely.
All the people of the society need to be free from such illiteracy to participate in the real development process.
Come, let us all together pledge to remove this kind of misdeeds from society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the governance of the State, and every person in the human tribe, for their special and comprehensive aspects of social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore, Karnataka wrote in MyGov that his father had a cost of six thousand rupees per year for treatment.
He was not intelligent about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana first.
But whenever he came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he went to buy medicines from there to Rs.
He said that while talking about Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about this so that more people get information about this.
Many people have been writing to me about this for a long time.
I have also seen a lot of video and social media. They are taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I know this kind of thing, I'm very happy.
I have a deep satisfaction.
And I am also very happy that Shri Darshan ji had come to know about the convenience he had received.
This makes the common man, especially those who are forced to take medicines everyday, economically benefits.
From here the life-saving medicines are made according to the approved standard of the World Health Organisation .
This is the main reason for getting good quality medicines cheaper .
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
Not only medicines are getting cheaper, but also new employment opportunities have been created for personal entrepreneurs.
Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendra and AMRUT STORS of the hospital are affordable.
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the country to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh has shared a picture on the Narendra Modi App from Maharashtra.
The picture was such that my attention was attracted to that picture.
It was a grandson who joined his grandmother in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Mission.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola have organised a Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to clean the river Morna.
Morna River used to flow twelve months ago, but now it's climate based.
The second sad thing is, the river was filled with wild grass and cattle.
The river and its surroundings were getting a lot of waste.
Hence, an Action Plan was set up and from 13th January to 13th January, 2019, the first phase of Mission Clean Morna was carried out at fourteen locations in two coastal areas of the river Morna.
Even on 20th January, this Swachhta Abhiyan is being carried out in the same way and I am told that unless the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will continue every Saturday morning.
It is impossible to understand that if a person takes a stable pledge to do something.
It is possible to bring about a big change through the mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the district and the administration of Purnigam and all the citizens associated with this work as a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions about Idang Padma Puraskar.
Discussions on news papers and TVs have attracted attention.
But if you look at this thing in mind, it will be proud that how great people are among us and naturally it will be proud that how the common man of our country is reaching this height without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of providing Padma Puraskar every year, but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can choose any person.
This has brought transparency in the entire process to be online.
It is said that this award has completely changed the election process.
All those people who are not seen in big cities, newspapers, TVs, programmes.
Now there is no significance of the person in the field of awards, and the importance of his work is increasing.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Guptaji.
He has been creating toys for four decades to enhance the consciousness of science among children.
Their efforts are to encourage the scientific experiments from irrelevant things.
For this, three thousand schools across the country are inspiring children by showing films made in 18 languages.
Such a story is from Sitaba Jodati, Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he has done a great job in changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself to Goddess at the age of seven, but then he added his entire life to the welfare of Goddesses.
Not only this, he also worked unprecedentedly for the welfare of the grouped women.
You may have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He used to do small jobs for life, but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honoured not only for this honour, but also for his entire hospitality.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Egypt, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who brightened the name of India abroad, has been recognised and awarded Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to hear the words of the tribal woman Laxmikutti of Kerala.
Laxmikutti teaches in the area of the fort and is still in the midst of dense jungles in the tribal areas in the shadows of swings .
He made five hundred medicinal medicines based on his memories.
He has the ability to make snake bites.
Laxmi ji is serving people relevant with his knowledge about this herbal medicine.
He was honored with Padma Shri for his participation in the society by identifying this ignorant personality.
Today, I want to mention another name, in West Bengal, the 25th year of Subashini Mistrik has also been awarded.
Such a woman who made utensils in other people's houses to build hospitals, sold vegetables.
When he was thirty-three years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and the incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospital built due to his hard work.
I am convinced that we have many such male and female jewellery in many jewellery, whom no one knows, don't know.
Sometimes, in school, colleges, such people should come and know their experiences.
There should be some efforts in society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas every year not January.
This is the day when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bonds between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we have organized a function where all the members of the Indian origin and members from all over the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that this event has included Indian genetic MPs and mayors from Malaysia, Egypt, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and other countries.
Our Indian genetics, who live in different countries of Europe, are working on cyber-security, some are associated with Ayurveda, some are happy with music or poetry.
I would like to thank the Europeans for this remarkable work, for the recognition of Indian genetics and for their contribution to the people of the world.
On 3rd January, the revered Bapu Puja-Tith, who had shown us a new path.
It wasn't just the basic element.
At present, we can see every step that Bapu's message was so correct.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path shown by Bapu, then what can be more than that pledge
My dear countrymen, I conclude with the best wishes of two thousand sixteen.
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
The event of Mann Ki Baat is the last festival of this year and see what wonderful event is the last day of 2017.
I and you have shared many things this year for almost a year.
In the Mann Ki Baat event, the exchange of your letters, commendations and opinions always fills me with a new inspiration.
And only a few hours will change the year, but this sustainability of our conversation will continue.
In the last year, we will talk more and more new things and share new experiences.
I extend my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the Festival of Hol Christmas was celebrated all over the world.
The festival is celebrated with great joy all over India.
At this time of Christmas, we recall the teachings and teachings of Jesus Christ, and the most emphasised words in Christ is service thinking.
This service is also reflected in the sensitivity of thinking.
Ramakrishna Paramahansadeva has also said that Shiva is to serve life in knowledge, and all these things have human values in the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was the year of Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th Prakash Parv.
On the one hand, Guru, poet, architect, a great warrior, he has inspired man.
He has shown a straightforward fight against injustice, he has shown ways to liberate from the bonds of caste and religion.
And in this endeavour he had to lose a lot of things in his personal life, but he never reflected his indifference.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come, we are committed to teaching Guru Gobind Singh ji and inspiring him from his great vision of life and following his ideals in our lives.
You are surprising to think that New Year comes every time and every time the fifteenth year comes, what is going to happen in this
The entire India looks forward to welcome you in the 21st century.
You are also proud of yourself in the 21st century voter house.
The power of synergy is the biggest strength of democracy.
Remember, you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and it is going to start from the fifteenth January.
On the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to specially connect the 18-25-year-old and strong youth power.
My belief is that our dreams of New India will be fulfilled only by filling the skills and strengths of this youth-power filled with vitality.
The New India that we are talking about in the coming days is a poison-free India of racism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India free from poverty and poverty.
New India, whose power is peace, unity and goodwill.
Make a way for yourself, connect those who are connected to you, and thus let the team be prosperous, let's move.
How do we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave a mass movement to the freedom movement.
My youngsters, this is the time when we also make the dream of a 21st century beautiful and meaningful India a movement.
Today, there are many opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are moving forward and successful.
I would like to imagine how these projects are available at a place of New India Youth, and there should be a system in this regard that can be accomplished at the age of eighteen, and that it can easily enable the world to take advantage of all these things.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken to you about positively in the previous Mann Ki Baat event.
Nothing is impossible for a person filled with positiveity and enthusiasm.
In English, everyone said that Pessimism Leedstu Weekness, Optimism to Power.
I had requested the people of the country to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcomed 2018 at a positive attachment.
I am glad that people have shared their experiences in a large number of social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Lakshadweep has been set up with 'Positive India Hashtag' which has reached more than 1.
The transmission of a positiveity has started in India and has spread all over the world.
The tournaments that came were inspiring.
It was a pleasure.
Some of the countrymen have discussed the events that have had adverse effects on those incidents this year.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
Sound byte Menonam Minu Bhatia.
I stay in Mayur Bihar, Pocket One, Face One, Delhi.
 My Nam Jyoti increases Rajendra.
And he died in an accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
This help of the government was very beneficial to us and we were able to handle the situation.
 I'm sorry.
The National Highway was constructed from different villages in 2017 by our village.
The two events that our Indian soldiers have carried out, one of the surgical strikes carried out by the Pakistanis, which had laid the foundation stone for the launch pads of the Ugpantha and the paradigm that our Indian soldiers had founded in Doklam was unparalleled.
 My name is Satish Bawani.
Over the last forty years, we were dependent on the pipeline built for the Army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So it won't be our bigger in 2017.
There are many people who are working at their own level to make a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are creating together.
Let us enter in 2018 with all these small joys, start the New Year and take strong steps towards a positive India.
When we all talk about positive, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I got to know about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak, the topper of the administrative service of Kashmir.
He drove out of the sympathy and hatred off the examination of the Administrative Service of Assam.
You'll be amazed to know that in 1990 the furious guys burned his native house.
There was so much worries and violence that his family had to come out of his natives.
The atmosphere of violence around a small child was enough for darkness and tightness in the heart but Anjum didn't let it happen.
He never left hope.
Today, he is inspiring not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that however bad the situation is, the desolate clouds can be destroyed through positive work.
I am happy to meet some of the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir this week.
And this is the strength of the country, this is our youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, only our countrymen, whenever the world's famous religious destinations are discussed, it is very natural to inaugurate the Sabarimala Temple of Kerala.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees are present every year in the blessings of Lord Ayappaswamy.
Where such a large number of devotees come, how many challenges can be made to maintain cleanliness in the place where such a larger importance is.
And especially the place between the mountains and the jungles.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called Punnam Punkavnam and launched a Swachhta Abhiyan to increase awareness about cleanliness.
He is a pilgrimage unless he works for cleanliness, his pious journey will not be completed.
There's no small distinction in this campaign.
Every pilgrimage is part of the worship of God in some way or the other or the other.
Every morning, this safai has a strange view and all the pilgrims are involved in it.
He can be a celebrity or a wealthy officer, or a very big pilgrim or a pilgrim, everybody participates in the Punya Punkavnam programme and he has to go through cleanliness.
The countrymen have many such examples.
The Swachhata Abhiyan is going on in every corner, Punnam Punkavnam is successful and all pilgrims participated in it.
And we have sworn in that time when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary, we will do something to give a Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made across the country for cleanliness.
A large number of people are participating everywhere in the rural and urban areas and changes are being made.
The Swachh Survekshan 2018, the worlds largest survey, will be organized from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the progress of cleanliness at the urban level.
This programme will be done among about 40 crore people in more than four thousand cities.
The Swachhata App will analysis for revision of access and services.
It will be observed that every person of the city is engaged in the process of keeping the city clean and it becomes the habit of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things look very small, but it becomes far-reaching in a society.
Today, I describe a similar event in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
After decades, this injustice is happening to Muslim women
However, he didn't have the right to Muslim women in our country.
I am very happy, our government has focused on this.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps in this regard and has changed the tradition of 70 years old.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Haj without Maharam and I am very happy that about 1300 Muslim women have requested to go to Haj and from different parts of the country, from Kerala to North India, Muslim women have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I have advised the Ministry of Minority Affairs to get permission from those women who want to go to Haj alone.
Our efforts will be to provide equal rights to our women and equal opportunities to take part in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a historic day of our country.
But on 26th January, 2018, the day has to be remembered specially.
It has never happened before in India's history.
The year 2017 was remarkable for ASEAN countries and India.
This year ASEAN completed 50 years and 25 years of Indias MoU with ASEAN-based countries in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for us to join together the ten great leaders of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is a festival, even though our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there's no such day when there's no mountains.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas together, and the new year is coming forward.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
We all move forward with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and commitments and the country will also move forward.
In January, the sun rises and celebrates Makar Sankranti.
It's a fair related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our mountains is attached to some or the other natural structures, but the way to celebrate these instruments of nature in our culture filled with diversity is different.
These mountains are celebrated between 13th to 17th January.
The names of these mountains are different, but the same element is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for all the festivals.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There is no one who doesn't remember him or gives him respect.
He is a witness to all our organisations and various events in the country.
He completed the ninth year on 28th September.
I had the privilege of talking to Mother on my phone before traveling abroad.
This story was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke with his elder sister.
Latadi, salute.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Salute.
I called for this because I will be busy traveling on the airways on your birthday.
I'll be back on 28th, and you'll be on 29th morning.
Okay, okay.
Lota ji: The age is very big, but the blessings of those who grow up with their own work are very big.
Yes, but I think these are the blessings of my parents and all listeners.
Modi ji:
I'm more happy when you proudly said your mother was 'Gujaratti'...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore, because I can see and know how much you work and how much you work.
What do you have to think
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I also sent one to him to take his blessings.
My mother was very happy to see your love.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you on your birth anniversary.
But it was so busy that I couldn't be late.
Yeah, yeah, very sure
My dear countrymen, with Navratri, the risk of festivals from today will once again fill with new enthusiasm and commitments.
Speak to the Festival
The festival will be happy and brilliant to be celebrated across the country for a few weeks.
The house will be happy.
But you must have seen there are many people around us who are deprived of this festival.
And that's what the darkness is under the lamp.
Perhaps this pleasure is not just a word, it's an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think, some rooms on one side are illuminated.
On the other hand, in front of him, some people have darkness in the house.
The sweets are destroyed in some houses, and in some houses the children are sweet for sweets.
At least, additional or unsuccessful things can be delivered to the house.
In many cities, startups of NGOs are working with young friends.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from people's houses, then find out the poor and sweets and reach them.
Can we take the darkness on the bottom of the lamp with complete awareness and commitment in this festival season
Laxmi was welcomed in traditional traditions.
In our culture, girls are regarded as Lakshmi, because girls bring good fortunes and prosperity.
Can we have a massive programme to honour girls in our society, in villages and cities this year
Can we keep the programme to honour these lakhs of India on this Deepavali
There are many daughters around us, many brides who are doing excellent things.
Somebody is working to teach poor children, somebody is creating awareness about cleanliness and health, somebody serves the society as a doctor-ingenia, somebody is trying to justify somebody by becoming fit.
Our society is proud of these daughters and their respect.
The programme of honouring them all over the country.
One more thing can be done, share the achievements of these girls in social media and use 'Hashtagbharatkilaxmi' as much as possible.
Like we all launched a massive campaign called Selfie With Doter, which spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I have said in the Mann Ki Baat programme. There is a funny advantage that I have the privilege of talking directly or indirectly to many familiar people.
A few days ago, Alina Taung, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roeing, in Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very happy to read, I think I'd be very beneficial if I read the book before the test.
I liked a lot of these writings, but I also pointed out that there are many suggestions for students in this book, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
I am sure that my young friends are also confident that the chief servant of the country will have to talk about any work.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing the letter first.
Thank you for reading Ekzam Warriors two-three times.
If I can take time for a new edition, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers like your words.
But I'll keep an appeal to all of you.
Can you help me
I must take care of them.
I will think about it and I will surely try to write in my language, my way.
Even if your advice comes in large numbers, then my new version will also be sure.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal's Alina Taung.
My dear countrymen, you are aware of the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through TV and through the newspapers.
But you know I'm a common man like you.
I heard that statement and saw the match.
The real and transformative feeling of Daniel Madbhav, 23, is like affecting everyone.
I must have been impressed.
Just a short while ago, he was awarded 19 Grandslam winners and Legend Rafael Nadal of Tennel.
In that situation, someone else would have been sorry and disappointed.
He lauded the sportsman Spirit for his sportspersons who lost their homes in the event of a drastic fight.
Champion Nadal also appreciated the game of Daniel.
The sportspersons and winners in the same match are both educated.
If you don't listen to Daniel Madbhave's speech, I would surely urge all of you, especially the youth to see that video.
It has to teach a lot for all ages, all the situations.
It's all the moments that are above the winners, these moments don't mean that the winners teach us.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say is only for your good.
Tarka-Bittark, the backbone continues, but it should be solved even before there is a quantity of things.
Otherwise the problem takes a bigger and it becomes a toxic thing to solve it.
If we're aware of the heels, we can save a lot.
That's what I think, I must talk to my young friends about a necessity.
We all know how harmful it is to the health of tobacco and it is difficult to leave it once it becomes a habit.
Tobacco nicotine is intoxicating.
In adolescence, the symptoms of smoking of tobacco are also damaged.
We all know about these things, but today I want to make you aware of a new thing.
You know, recently the injunction on India-cigarette has been issued.
E-cigarette is an electronic instrument different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, a kind of chemical smoke is grown by hot nicotine liquid substances through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of general cigarettes, but there is an error about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used for not smelling ordinary cigarettes.
We keep watching that he tried to smoke in any family in his father's smokerhole so that nobody else smokes.
And the little cigarette of Chanbari, keep it away from the beedi.
There is no smoke about cigarettes, those who are selling, buying or seeing, all know that cigarettes are harmful.
But the e-cigarette is totally different.
There's very little awareness about this.
The common man is not aware of the dangerous aspects of e-cigarettes and that's why the dedication-cigarette has entered the house.
Sometimes the children are showing magic games in front of parents in the family, without fire, without smoke and smoke from the mouth, by eating e-cigarettes and slaughtering the elders.
You know, we can smell it when someone smokes cigarettes around us.
Even pockets of cigarettes can be understood through smell.
It does not happen in the field of e-cigarettes. Young people know, ignorant, or fashioned statehood, roam around in their bags, in the middle of the books or in the hands of their hands.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarettes have been hampered so that these new instruments of drugs do not bow down to our country, do not fulfil the dreams of the family, do not ruin the lives of children.
Somehow, the drugs cannot be stained in society.
I urge you all to abandon the practice of tobacco and stop putting any misunderstanding about e-cigarettes.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means, but it doesn't just go to jams every morning and evening.
The name of these misunderstandings is also Fit India.
I believe, I don't want to worry about you, but it's very good.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of all those great personalities who have sacrificed their lives not for themselves but for others.
Our India, our landscapes are numerous.
A lot of humanitarian gifts to this country.
One such humanity is going to be honoured in Vatican City on 13th October, which is a matter of pride for us all over the country.
That day, Pope Francis, is going to declare Marium Treasy as a Saint.
Scientist Marium Treasure is a reflection of the incomplete contributions made by humanity in a young age of fifty years.
Once again, I pay my respects to Sister Marrium Treasy and congratulate the Indians, especially my brothers and sisters, for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150, and at the same time 130 crore Indians have committed to completely shut down the use of single use plastic.
The way India has played a leading role in conserving the environment, the entire world is now looking at India.
I am convinced that on 2nd October, you all will be involved in the expedition of single use plastic.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own ways.
However, a young man in our country has started a wonderful campaign.
His work attracts me and I call him and try to know and understand his new plan.
Perhaps his words will help other people of the country.
It was also new to me when I heard the playing words for the first time.
Perhaps this word is slightly used abroad.
Hello, Ripudamanji, I'm saying Narendra Modi.
We will not only take care of our health, but we will also be able to protect our mother's health.
I believe that our country will take 130 crore steps to build a single useful plastic free India in this direction.
Ripu Damanji, thank you once again
My dear countrymen, the preparations for October 2 are going on all over the country and the world, but we want to take the path of Gandhi 150.
I want to bring my life to the welfare of the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the dream of all of us and that is why every year on 31st October, we are organizing a run for unity in the entire country.
My dear countrymen, maybe you will remember that on 15th August, I had told from the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to fifteen places of India.
At least go to 15 places and try to stay there for a night.
You see India, understand, feel.
We have a variety of diversity.
On the occasion of Deepawali, all of you are going to roam, so I urge you to visit fifteen places of India.
You will be happy to know that India has improved considerably in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and this is possible due to your cooperation.
This is due to the importance of traveling in particular.
That is, we have moved a long way in this time and if we try to get one place in the tourism sector even before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of this diverse India.
You must also see that in the days of Deepavali, there is no fire either or there is no harm to any person.
Once again I have a lot of good wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, salute all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepawali, the Great Chat is one of the most important festivals in our country.
From food habits to widespread, everything is followed by traditions.
Chhat Puja is full of unparalleled nature and worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water are at the centre of worship of Mahaparavchat, and the components made of bamboo and soil and the original materials related to its worship.
It also contains the significance of cleanliness in our lives.
Sixty years ago, the safai of the entire village, the river, the pond, the surroundings of Khanakand, the safai of the ghats, and the zeal of the glory.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Environment Conservation, Disease Redressal and Governance.
Behind the practice of eating prasad, it is also argued that the fears are destroyed and the fears that obstruct the progress of the person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat is bound up with the people of the country.
Take examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You must be happy to hear that the only store in Khadir Handloom is sold.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Deepawali has increased by about six hundred and eighty percent.
Khadi and handicraft motorcycles have also increased by nearly ninety percent this year compared to last year.
It is being seen that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every age group like handlooms.
I can imagine how many families, poor families and the families working in handloom.
And we had spoken of Khadi for fashion, but for some time, I can say from my heart that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for fashion, now, Khadi for Transformation is taking that place.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, handlooms have changed the lives of the poor and become a powerful tool to empower them.
He said he is playing a very big role in the village.
Mr. Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experience of my Deepawali with the Defence Force and he also wants to know how the Defence Force is doing Deepawali.
Mr. Tejas Khariwad also wrote in the Narendra Modi App: What can be the way to reach our defence forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also believe that the sweets of our houses must reach the youth.
You all have celebrated Deepawali with a lot of joy.
Deepawali has brought me a special experience.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces appointed.
This time, the celebration of Deepawali with the Defence Forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir became unforgettable for me.
I pay homage to all our defence forces on behalf of all the nations for their dedication, dedication and sacrifice to the nation by protecting our defence forces against the difficult situation in the border.
When we have a space, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our youth, they should listen to their pride.
Many of us don't know that our defence forces are playing a vital role in establishing peace not only in the border but also in the world.
As the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, they are shining India all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, the UN Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone recalls the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been contributing actively to the UN's various important initiatives since the beginning.
You must know that the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposals of the UN Charter, both of these words have begun.
India has always emphasized the equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Development of Human Rights.
Its initial essay was All Man and Burn Free Equal, which was reversed by Indias representative Hansa Mehta and later was the Alhuman Beings and Burn Free Equal.
Though it looks a very small change, we see a healthy idea.
India has played an important role in the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations in UN Amberla.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace and Education Mission.
There are many of you who know this for the first time.
More than eighteen thousand defence forces have contributed to the peacekeeping efforts of the United Nations.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are attached to UN peacekeeping and this is the third largest number in the world.
By August 2017, about fifty people have contributed to the world's seventeen peacekeeping efforts.
These efforts are going on in various parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at the hospital of Indian Army in Kango and South Sudan and innumerable people have been rescued.
The defence forces of India have not only protected the people of the country but have also enjoyed their minds by making peaceful efforts.
Indian women have played a vital role in peacekeeping.
It is very rare to know that India sends the Women Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Movement in Liberia.
And look, this initiative of India has become an inspiration for all the countries since then.
Since then, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only limited to peacekeeping but also for training the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our external peacekeepers are delivering the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
The peace-security campaign is not at all possible.
Our security forces have to go and work in all the ruins of the soldiers.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the people are filled with pride.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force who was honored with Parambir Chakra.
Lt Gen Prem Chand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces who have also received special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
In 1996, at the age of 72, he was appointed Commander of the Armed Forces and served to ensure the independence of Namibia.
The former General of the Indian Army, Thimayya, led the UN Peacekeeping Force at Cyprus and served as a part of peacekeeping.
India is always a messenger of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
Let us live a peaceful and harmonious life and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage is dedicated to all the great people of India who have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, whom we live, knows as Lord Nivedita in honour, he is also one of these great people.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland, and later he was named Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
Nivedita means who is fully dedicated.
Afterwards, he proved the right glory of his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Cystarnibetti.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his lives for the poor and the poor.
Sister Nivedita, the atrocities of the British king would have suffered a lot.
The British tried to compel Indians not only physically, but also mentally and slavery.
There was always an attempt to reflect our culture below.
Bhagwani Nivedita re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Inspired by the national consciousness, awakened and helped people unite.
He roamed around different countries of the world against the oppression of Sanatan religion and philosophy.
Famous Nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will always be a part of his poem 'Pudumi Penn', 'NewWomen' and 'Nari Empowerment'.
It is said that Bhagwani Nivedita was a source of inspiration.
Bhaginivedita also helped great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose in many ways.
Through his writings and various conferences, he helped both in examining and examining.
This is a miracle of India where our cultures spirituality and science are supplemented by each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose beauty of this thought.
In 1899, in the Calcutta Mahanagar, people were in the midst of death in Shayya.
Sister Nivedita, ignores her health, come forward in the Sarastaghat and Narmada Safai campaign.
He's the woman who left the sickness and disintegrated himself to the poor and suffering people.
Sister Nivedita, who gave her everything to India, is resting here.
Undoubtedly, a story is always true.
This will be our fulfilment of this adventurous personality if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of the building of a New India, the hero of the next day.
The diseases that had been seen in the old age are now visible in the streets.
It's surprising to hear that children are also victims of diabetes these days.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Nowadays these diseases are called Lifestyledisorder.
The main reason behind these diseases is lack of physical labor and change in food habits.
It needs to be taken care of by both society and family.
If we think about this, there is no need to change unusual or terrible.
Whatever is needed is to pay attention to small things and to make them under their own habits.
I want the people of the family to be careful to create a habit of playing in the open field.
If possible, the elders of the family will also participate with them.
To make children use stairs instead of lifts.
After dinner, let the whole family walk with children.
India: Yoga will help in creating a healthy lifestyle habits and saving our youth from lifestyle disorders.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be taught only.
No special instruments or fields are required.
There is a lot of testing in this regard that is effective in controlling diabetes.
A lot of work is going on in AIIMS and the results that have been received so far are very hopeful.
Ayurveda and yoga should not only be treated as disease-free, but should also be part of daily life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy since the world of sports.
India is also happy in the bedmint like Haki.
The Badminton Star Kidambi Srikant won the Goldenmark Open and honoured every Indian.
This is his third superstar after Indonesian Open and Australian Open.
I congratulate these youngsters for their success and for the prosperity of India.
Friends, FIFA under-17 World Cup was organised this month.
The teams from all over the world have come to India to participate in it and their sportspersons have enjoyed us.
I also had a match.
The audience from the player was very excited.
The World Cup is a big event, where the world looks at you.
I was overwhelmed by the zeal, zeal and inspiration of young players.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best skills.
Even if India is not able to win, Indian players have enjoyed the hearts of everyone.
India and the entire world have celebrated this festival and the entire footwear tournament was very entertaining for the fans of footwear.
The future of footwear is very bright and its predictions.
I convey my best wishes to all stakeholders, their colleagues and all sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, if I have to be aware of the Swachh Bharat, then I have to do the Mann Ki Baat programme every day and everybody will have to discuss this cleanliness.
Someone takes pictures of various efforts of small children and sometimes the success of the team fort of youngsters.
Somewhere, innovation takes place on sanitation, somewhere the work of an officer becomes new.
A few days ago, I got a broadport where the revival of the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra is mentioned.
The entire team of NGO, called Ecological Protection Organization, launched a safai campaign at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after the safai.
I am surprised to see and I remember those who have been surrounding the surroundings of the filthy environment, who are thinking about how to clean such a dirt, can see the pictures of Chandrapur fort, I would like to tell them how the labour, commitment, jealousy and livelihood of the youth of the Ecological Protective Organisation.
Your disappointment with them, your confidence will go away.
This Bhagirath effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, dedication and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Historical heritage security and conservation are the responsibility of all the citizens.
I thank all the workers of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanakshudhu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is Jagadguru.
He has conceived the welfare of the entire humanity and has spoken equally to all the nations.
He stressed on womens self-reliance and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev has travelled 28000 km and he has spread the message of humanity in this footprint.
He has met the people, guided them to truth, sacrifice and dedication.
He didn't just say anything in his own life and in his own work.
He launched a library and transmitted services to the people.
Equality and egalitarianity are awakened by eating food at the galleries together.
Guru Nanak has spoken of three ways of efficient life, encapsulate the name of the soul, refrain from labour and help the injured.
Guru Nanak also wrote Gurubani for his words.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, we try to move to life by listening to our words and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and two days later on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created the plan of a modern India.
We can learn a lot from the excellent life of this great child of India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as a library to India.
I have ensured that millions of Indians are in the shadow of One Nation One Constitution.
His indifference gave me the power to cross all obstacles.
He has set a goal and he has moved ahead with that goal at the end.
He used to say that the country can only do the work of a bond that dreams of a nation where all people have equal rights.
I want this word of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to always inspire us.
He said that we cannot change the variety of nations and communities, and every woman and male of India should determine the future of the people who love and love each other.
Sardar Saheb's speech is still the inspiration and strength of our New India Vision.
And that is why his birth anniversary will be celebrated as National Unity Day.
The contribution of our country to make it an integral form is unforgettable.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb will be organised across the country where children, women, youth and infants will be commended.
I urge all of you to participate in this goodwill festival, run for unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, you have returned to your daily life in a new resolve and new dedication.
My best wishes to all the citizens of the country for fulfilling their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2017
It has been completed three years to make Mann Ki Baat through the astronomy.
This is the 36th edition today.
Most of them encourage me.
And I take you half an hour in a month, but people keep reaching their points for thirty-three days of Mann Ki Baat.
And that is why there is a simple idea of paying attention to the sensitivity of the government and the strength of the society far and wide.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of their thoughts and feelings.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to inform the people of the country.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember that Acharya Binoba.
Acharya Binoba often said, non-governmental, effective.
I believe that three years later, sociologists, universities, researchers and media experts will definitely analyze this.
I believe that this analysis will be beneficial for the future of Mann Ki Baat.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think about eating that we will not destroy it as much as we need.
But then I have seen that such letters have come from every corner of the country, many social organizations and many youngsters have been doing this thing several times before.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I see the Selfie With Doctor of a Panchayat chief in Haryana and I put it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only from India but also from all over the world, Selfie With Dr.
A few days ago, I was sitting with the Department of Tourism, Government of India.
Send the photographs wherever you have gone to India.
Films from every corner of India have become a huge wealth for those who work in the field of tourism.
I have realized how many small events make a big movement.
Today, I want to say, because when I think it's been three years, how many things have happened in the last three years.
The country is moving on the right path at every moment.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
In my three-year journey Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt it from the countrymen, I have learnt it.
It's a funny wealth for any country, a funny power.
And I have seen that Iding has grown very much towards Khadi and I naturally said that nobody has to fall.
But there's a variety of fabrics, isn't it okay
The house can be silver, the curtains, and it seems that the youngsters have grown towards Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased and there has been a direct connection with the employment of the poor.
On 2nd October, a lot of leaves are left in Khadi.
Once again, I would like to say that we will take the campaign for Khadi forward.
We are working with this idea that we will burn the lamps of Deepawali at the house of the poor by buying Khadi.
The poor people of our country will get a strength from this work, and we should do it.
And in order to increase the interest of the Khadi, the workers of the Khadi region and the people associated with the Khadi of the Government of India have been encouraged to think about a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase manufacturing capabilities, how to bring solar energy and handloom cotton
The old heritage, which had been closed for about 20, 25, 30 years, can be revived.
In Uttar Pradesh, a Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years, but today it has been revived.
There's a lot of ways.
A lot of people have got new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries Training Centres have been resumed in Pampore of Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to offer.
Now, for the resumption of this training centre, new generations are getting help in modernization, hearing and making new things. And I am happy that the big corporate houses that provide during Deepawali have started giving food items.
People are also offering a gift to each other.
We all feel how things are moving easily.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we all made a pledge to celebrate Swachhta across the country on the 15th day of Gandhi Jayanti.
I'll connect the people with cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering.
Each old, male and female, city-village has become a part of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
When I talk about the resolution, we can see how this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving on the path of resolution.
I've pointed out that some people are working to put it.
This time we have seen one more thing - first, we can clean somewhere, secondly, we cannot make any place unconscious, but if we have to make a habit of cleanliness then we need a genuine change in our ideas.
This time a number of competitions were organized in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the creation of Swachhta.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have photographed their own vision of cleanliness.
Whenever I talk about cleanliness, I have never forgotten to express my gratitude to the media persons.
We are witnessing the Swachhata Hi Seva movement in the country's electronic media and print media.
A few days ago, somebody attracts my attention to the 18-year-old youth of Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
Since the age of 12-13, Bilal has been working with sanitation for the last 5-6 years.
The largest lake in Asia near Srinagar is also cleaning plastic, polythene, bottles used and dirty.
I am glad that Paurnigam Bilal has not only made Brand Ambassador but has also given Bilal a car, uniform, and Bilal is also going to other areas to educate and inspire the people of the country, and does not leave the way to get the desired results.
Bilal Dar is young but inspiring to those who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of history and when we talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
Sardar Patel was born from Mahatma Gandhi in the month of October, who gave us leadership in the 21st century, showed us the path of walking and those who have suffered a lot for the country.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji, spoke to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He used to mention the programme in a deep sense and he himself went to the village to showcase the work of Nanaji.
Remembering these great men, they do not benefit, we remember them so that they can find ways ahead so that the right direction is given to the future.
I will definitely tell you about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in Mann Ki Baat.
We are very easy to say that unity between diversity is the specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity, however, we are proud of diversity, do we ever try to realize that diversity
I want to repeat to all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially to my younger generation, that we are in a waking position.
You must feel the diversity of this India, touch it, realize its pride.
This diversity of our country plays an important role in the development of your individual.
You go abroad, I don't have any objection, but sometimes you'll see your house
The people of North India don't know what is in South India
The people of western India don't know what is in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam ji visited India, a new inspiration was awakened to see, understand and save the country.
These great men have roamed around the country.
They tried to know and understand India in the beginning of their work.
He tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we not even learn from different states of our country, the rules of different communities or groups, traditions, their clothing, their food habits as a writer, to understand, to lead his lifestyle
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we are not only a visitor but also trying to take, understand and integrate the features of those places like a student.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own country.
In more than four and a half districts, we have experienced to dwell at night.
Today, when I am taking over this pride in the country, I have the experience of visiting that place.
That's why I have special benefits to understand many things.
I would like to urge you to gain this storage of our immense energy not only in the form of a slogan but also in this larger India.
If a new kind of food is eaten every day, it will not be repeated.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism.
I don't want you to get out of the house just for a little change.
Your worries will grow.
What else can be a teacher beyond achieving
Normally, the time from October to March is widespread for tourism.
If you meet the people there, send a picture to them.
Let us not only write about architecture but also of natural beauty.
Send all the magnificent documents to MyGov and send them to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen one thing that if you can have seven best tourist destinations in your own state for the development of India's tourism industry, every Indian needs to know about these seven things in his state.
If possible, we have to go to that seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if all the states of the same state send these information then I will tell the government to scrutinize them and make the issue of which seven communications have come from every state.
I mean, how can a tourist destination be improved from a way of human beings
Similarly, the seven things that you have seen all over the country liked, you want to see someone or the other, if you want to go there then you must send the names of these seven places of your choice to MyGov and Narendra ModiApp.
The Government of India will work on this.
The government will accept the decisions made by you, making films, making videos, propagating literature and extension of such good sights.
Come on, join me.
This month of October to March, you may also have a big implication in the development of tourism.
I'm inviting you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my mind, swing my mind.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps your vision was attracted - a surprising example of womens strength and patriotism was seen by the countrymen.
The Indian Army has received two virgins in the name of Lieutenant Welcome and Fund, they are unparalleled brave.
This is a wonderful reason that welcomings and freedom fighters were martyred to serve Mother India.
We can imagine what will happen if the world disappears at this young age
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadevi's wife Swati Mahadik took this decision against this difficult situation and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dreams of his husband.
Similarly, Nidhi, her husband Mukesh used to work as a hero in the army and when she was martyred for the motherland, her wife decided to remind her and she was also in the army.
It is natural for every countrymen to pay homage to these brave men and women.
I congratulate these two sisters from my heart.
They have created a new inspiration for millions of people of the country, a new consciousness.
Congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between Navratri and Deepawali, there is also a great opportunity for our youth.
The World Cup of FIFA under-17 is coming here.
I believe sounds like footwear all around.
Every generation will be attracted to footwear.
There will be no school colleges in India where our youth will not be able to play footwear.
Come, when the whole world is playing on the ground, we also take this game to our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
Mother Durga's feelings.
The entire environment is full of auspicious fragrance.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I congratulate the people of the country and pray to the mother Shakti, let our country reach new heights of success in fulfilling the aspirations and aspirations of the people of the country.
Let us come to our country with the capability to deal with every challenge.
The country should improve at a rapid pace and in the 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, we have started a journey by making a five-year road map to fulfill the dreams of freedom fighters, the commitment of 125 crore Indians, the hard work, many men and the commitments.
I don't wish you all a lot.
Observe the festival, brighten the enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who dedicates his mind to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, the values that our ancestors have reflected in the spirit of non-violence are linked to our lives.
'Ahingsa Param Dharma' - It's what we're listening to from Egypt.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be ruined in the name of belief, it can be sympathetic beliefs, beliefs in political thinking or beliefs in any tradition, violence will not be ruined in any field.
Nobody has the right to handle the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
The Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us is ensuring that every person has the right to get treatment.
I would like to assure the people of the country that the government or the country will not miss anybody who is going on the path of violence, whoever is a person or a community.
Everyone has to be renewed to the law, the law will judge him and the culprits will have to be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly connected to farmers and fishermen brothers.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first I want to tell you Mishami Dukkadam.
The Sambhari festival of the Jain community was celebrated last year.
Poshan Parva is celebrated in Bhadra month in Jain society.
Samvatri Festival is a reflection of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And this is also called the Parama-Baani Festival and on this day there is a tradition of commending each other as 'Michhami Dukkadam'.
Besides, we are in our scriptures forgiveness of Veerasya Bhushanam.
My dear countrymen, now Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm all over India.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi was spoken, the issue of public democracies is normal.
This great festival of Ganesh Chatti lasts for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
On this occasion, I would like to tell every countrymen that there is a lot of good wishes for the festival of Ganesha.
Now ONAM Festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
ONAM is one of the major festivals of Kerala in India.
This festival is special for its social and cultural significance.
Onam Festival recalls the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the countrymen that just like the festival of Gujarat or the festival of West Bengal has become the main attraction of tourism today.
There is also a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
Imagine what we can take in the coming days.
How long will Id-ul-uha be celebrated on this festival
I extend my best wishes and good wishes to all the countrymen.
Festivals and cleanliness are integral to our family life.
Festivals are being prepared through cleanliness.
It is not new, but it is very important to make cleanliness socially.
Cleanliness is not only in our houses, but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country, this cleanliness and festival must be tied in a cotton bond that will be impossible.
My dear countrymen, the practice of becoming modern is changing regularly.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see in YouTube, nowadays the children are making a statue of Ganesh with soil.
The Swachhta Abhiyan that we launched three years ago was completed on 2nd October.
At a time, the officers of the Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind, in the Banaskantha district of Gujarat, have taken over the entire task of sanitation and sanitation of 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods.
If this effort of dedicated cleanliness becomes a sustainable part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I urge you to come, once again, on 2nd October, to celebrate 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti, Swachhta Hi Seva, as said earlier, 'Jal Seva is Lord Seva and Swachhta Hi Seva'.
It creates a clean environment across the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we find and use the opportunity.
Please do your job.
On holidays or Sundays, work together.
Go to the surrounding settlements, go to the nearby villages, give it a movement.
I urge all NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government visits, collectors and Panchayat chiefs, on October 2, the fifteen days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, create a clean environment that will fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
It has created a department in which you can register your name and name of the family whom you have helped in this work.
My social media friends can conduct some creative publicity in the virtual world that can actually be inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation can organise a short-term film and film making competition under Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Abhiyan.
You can write in different languages and there is no specific age of this competition.
Three of the participants will be selected and awarded at the district level and three at the State level.
I urge you to take part in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions of audience and millions of people, sometimes through letters, sometimes sending messages or phones, sending messages to me, which is a supreme achievement and rare wealth.
This is a great opportunity for me to know about the feelings and minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your news as much as you are waiting for the Mann Ki Baat event.
I'm looking forward to it because I can learn a lot from you.
I'm trying to see, hear, read and know as much as you can.
Prime Minister, I am devoted to Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my bondmen.
He's always trying to help people, but he has a habit that I'm surprised to see.
I went to buy him once.
He bought a two thousand pieces of sari, spent 450 rupees for Pitzer.
However, I have spent a long time with Autowal to go to Mall for five rupees.
He did the same work while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five.
I was so bad.
We spend a lot of money in big shops without any cost, but I am confident that our working brothers and sisters are bagging for a small amount.
I believe that after listening to this phone, you have not only been aware, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
Do you think that whenever we come to sell things around our houses, come back to sell things, we work with a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes with auto-rickshaws, whenever we work with a talented man, we need to guarantee.
And when people like us go to eat a big restaurant, don't see what's written in the bill, I'll get the money out.
Not only this, I don't want to buy saris in the showroom, but don't leave the poor if they work with the poor.
Two rupees, five rupees will not make any difference in your life, but have you ever seen how deeply hurt this normal behavior in his mind
Ma'am, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling such a heartfelt.
I believe that they will surely abandon the behaviour of the poor among my countrymen.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hawki is unparalleled.
I recall this because I want our country to be associated with new generations of sports.
Sports should be part of our life.
If we are the third nation of the world, then we should also keep in mind this spirit in the field of playing.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alternates, personality enhancing.
Sports from one side is an excellent door to mix heart.
Our younger generations will come forward in the field of playing and today in the age of computers, I would like to be aware that the playing field is more important than the place.
Please play the computer, but in the fields outside, sometimes with footwear.
Perhaps Cricket plays in the computer, but in the open field, the joy of playing cricket below the sky is different.
Today, the situation is such that the kids start looking at cartoon films at a corner of the house and otherwise they become funny in the mobile games and then you're going out.
The time changed, he was a time when the mother told the boy when you came and today there was a situation that she had to tell her, Dad, when are you going out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has created a Sports Talent Survey portal to explore and develop talent in sports, where children from all over the country can upload their biodes or videos in the portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
It is a good news for our youth that on 6th to 28th October, India is going to organise the Andaman Seventeen World Cup.
The world's twenty four teams are going to make India their homes.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports, create a suitable environment in the country.
When I am talking about the game today, I remember that last week's march, I want to share it with the countrymen.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who had no connection with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy, their emotions will inspire us all.
These six daughters will take a small boat - I-N-S Tarini, and pass through the sea.
This campaign has been named Nabika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after a few months of travel across the world.
Sometimes it's only forty days.
Sometimes I'll spend thirty days in the water.
Our six brave daughters in the midst of the ocean waves, and this is the first such event in the world.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of our daughters
I communicate with the feelings of these girls, and I told them to share their feelings with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their thinking on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because it's a brave credibility, it's about your thoughts, and I'm glad to let these girls reach you.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate the Teachers' Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but he made himself a teacher for his entire life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a dedicated life to education.
The importance of a teacher is to awaken the spirit of creation and enjoy knowledge among his students.
Can I start a campaign in a mission mode
When the transformation comes in our country, just as the mother of the family recalls the role of teacher in the society.
Teachers play a big role in transformation.
In every teacher's life there is an incident of some or the other student's transformation artisan and we make all efforts.
It will play a big role in the transformation of the country.
Come, let us move ahead with this mantra Tech to Transform.
My name is Dr. Anuja.
I am a resident of Mumbai and associated with the India Research Centre of Howard University.
The scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
Three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed tomorrow on 28th August.
30 crore Indians have participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you have money at home or in the pocket, you're gonna get to the bad cost.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have deposited about 65 thousand crore rupees.
The Prime Minister said that the scheme of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also provided the benefits of insurance.
Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana have created new confidence in the lives of those poor people today with only one and three rupees premium.
The benefits of one premium are being given to two lakhs when the poor people of the family have been damaged.
The Prime Minister's Mudra Yojana and how many benefits have been made for the common man for the insurance have shown me a lot of encouraging results.
My dear countrymen, let me tell you, 'Mishmi Dukkadam'
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
The mind of the people is that the rainy season is very pleasant to the people.
Animals, vegetation, nature, everybody blossoms on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible form, it is understood how much the devastating capacity of the water is.
Nature is our livelihood, our livelihood, but sometimes natural illusions like floods, earthquakes, its terrible form becomes devastating.
The changes in the weather and climate have a negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to heavy rains.
It's being monitored all over the devastated region.
Rescue operations are being widely carried out.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are reaching.
The state government is also making all efforts to help the affected people in their own way.
Citizens wishing to work in social organisations, cultural organisations and services are making every effort to help people in this situation.
Agricultural, Animals, Infrastructure, Power and Communications are all affected.
In particular, for the loss of crops and fields of our farmer brothers, we have formulated schemes for providing insurance companies, especially agricultural insurance companies to play a viable role so that the farmers' welfare can be done at a rapid pace.
People are talking about their distance.
Even before the rainy season, the entire government programme was constructed in most places by drilling the mock.
The team of NDRF was appointed.
Gradually, we have created us as per the predictions of the rain, so that we can get rid of losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of my country are more than me.
This time there's so many letters about GST, so many phones have come, and people are still glad about GST, ask questions.
I want to hear a phone: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am calling Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I am extremely impressed by your speech at the Chartered Accountant Day.
That is why Goods and Services Tax (GST) has started in our country today.
I'd like to listen to you.
Thank you.
It's almost a month since the launch of GST and its beneficial results are visible.
And I am very happy that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the cost of goods used for GST has decreased, the things have become cheaper.
The North-Eastern region, the far-flung hilly region, the jungle residents are writing in a letter that the first person was not afraid of what would happen, but now when I am aware that the work has become easier than before.
Business has become very easy.
And the biggest thing is that the traders of consumers are increasing.
Now I see the impact of GST on the Transport and Logistics Sector.
How the truck's going up.
As a result, there is a strong smooth movement in which immigration is being done, new registration is happening and this is creating a new trust across the country.
And sometimes, the economists, the experts of the management, the pundits of technologies, through their research, must make the use of GST in India a model for the world's needs.
It will become a case student for different universities in the world.
Because such a big change, the contribution of such a million people to it, its use and success in such a large country, it is a success point in itself.
The world will definitely find out about this.
GST has been used, each state has participated in it and every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken by all States and Centres together.
And this is the first goal of every government that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I thank all the Ministries, all the departments, central and state governments associated with this work.
GST is an excellent example of Indias integral energy.
This is a historical achievement.
This is also a campaign for social reforms.
Once again, I salute crores of people to achieve such a great effort in my heart.
My dear countrymen, the month of August Movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened to our new generations on August 9, 1942.
It is an inspiration for us to build a better India in the history leaves, how they have to bear, how they have to bear, how they have to bear with the hope of independence from 1857 to 1942.
This was the time when every corner of India, every corner of the city-village, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, every corner of the country, the educated, uneducated, the poor, all the people had joined the shoulders and became a part of the uit India movement.
On the request of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle in the mantra of Karange Ya Marang.
On 9th August, when Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement, the British took over all the big leaders and came forward to take the lead in the movement.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan are the leaders of the second generation.
Mahatma Gandhi's two different forms are shown in the 1920 Action Abhiyan and the uit India Movement of 1942.
The faces of non-cooperation movement were so similar, afterwards in 42, the rapidity of the movement increased so much that even the great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karange Yamreng'.
These achievements were followed by public support, public support, public commitment and public participation.
The whole country was fighting together that day.
I sometimes think that by collecting the leaves of history, it is understood that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857.
The war that began in 1857 has been going to some corner of the country till 1942 and it has given birth to a strong demand for freedom in the hearts of the people.
Everybody is committed to doing something.
The generations have changed, but the rapidity of their commitments is nothing.
A group of people have come, have been involved in the struggle, have gone and new teams have come and they have joined the same struggle and have tried to make the British empire free of cost for the country.
From 1857 to 1942, the effort brought the movement to an end in 1942, and the vision of 'Bharatchado' was sounded that it could go to English in 1947 in five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, the freedom movement reached every countrymen and from 1942 to 1947, this five-year resolution became the reason for the independence of the country.
These five years were the founder.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
In 1947, we were free and today 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
The government has come, it has gone.
NITI Aayog has been created, has changed, has been transformed.
Everybody has worked hard to get rid of the problems of the country.
In order to increase the income of the common man in the country, continuous efforts are being made to eradicate poverty.
The hopes have increased.
On 15th August, 2017, we will celebrate the launch of the Sankalp Parv and on the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, we will also achieve that commitment.
From 1942 to 1947, as the five years of independence became a decisive year, from 2017 to 2022, this five years of India's future will be a decisive year and it will have to be done.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A resolution that we will determine in the next five years.
Come, take the video posts, blogs, records and new ideas using technology.
This movement has to be given the form of a mass movement.
In the Narendra Modi App, the uit India uiz Competition will also be organized for young friends.
This uiz competition is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am happy that what should be said last three years on 15th August, I have received several proposals from every corner of the country and the main objective of these proposals is to make their dreams a word.
I will try to discuss these proposals as far as I can on 15th August.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about another thing today.
The socio-economic policies are inspired by the economy of India.
You shouldn't ever finish this.
Our festivals, festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals and festivals, in fact, are directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the country with every festival of social reforms.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Chauth Chandra, Ananth Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will be celebrated and this time the poor will get some opportunity to earn money.
All these festivals have a comfortable joy.
Talking about the economy, a few months before the Raksha Bandhan Festival, hundreds of households have become a small family business.
There are many types of silk and cotton cotton cotton and nowadays people like to keep homemade.
Hundreds of thousands of businessmen are associated with the festival.
Build small soil lamps, but Deepawali is directly related to those poor families.
Today, when I talk about the economy of the festival, the festival and the poor people associated with it, I want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of the country are more aware and active than me and I have achieved it.
Aware people have written a letter to me about the environment for the last one month.
They have requested me to talk about eco-friendly Ganesha in Ganesh Chaturthi so that people like the manufacturing of the soil and plan.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year, the 125th anniversary of the public Ganesh Festival.
125th year and 125 crore Indians.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival started with the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also recall that this year, during the Ganesh Festival, organisations, conclaves etc.
Come, let us connect this festival with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy our festivals become the economic festival of the poor and the economic joy of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the coming several festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the field of education, economic sector, social sector or sports, our daughters are brightening the country and reaching new heights of success.
Our countrymen are proud of our companions, we are proud of them.
Just a few days ago, we have shown excellent talent in women's cricket.
This week I had the opportunity to meet these players.
They had a mark on their faces.
I told those girls about a different valuation of me.
I have seen that if the players of India are foolish, then the country's anger is overwhelming.
Some people say something that breaks down, insists that it is very painful.
It's not all this, the girls calculated what they did, gave them respect.
I have changed a beautiful change in this, and I have told these girls that you see, this is only fortunate for you.
Whether you win matches or not, you have won the minds of 1. 25 billion people.
Indeed, our youth, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I want to remind you of the August movement and once again I want to remind you on 9th August.
May every countrymen guide the five years to fulfill their commitments.
Come on, we walk together, do something or the other.
The fate of the country and the future of the country will continue to grow.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
The weather is changing.
It was so hot this time.
It is fortunate that the rainy season is following its footprints.
The rain has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, the cold wind feels relaxed from the heat of the last day.
We all have seen however excitement or anxiety in personal life or in public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath Dev in different parts of the country is going on with great enthusiasm and joy.
Nowadays, in some other places of the world, Lord Jagannathji's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are particularly connected to Lord Jagannathdev.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English language 'Juggernaut', which means a beautiful chariot which cannot be stopped.
It means that this word has come from Jagannathdev.
This means that the people of the world have accepted the importance of this journey of Jagannathji in their own way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all take the country forward by bringing inspiration from this sacred festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I got to know about a very inspirational incident in Mubarakpur village of Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Around one and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in this small village.
In this month, all the villagers decided to make toilets together.
17 lakhs has been given to them as per the assistance given by the government for making private toilets.
You will be surprised to hear that in this holy month of Ramadan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of that place have returned the amount of Rs. 17 lakhs to the government.
It may cost Rs. 17 lakhs for other services.
On this auspicious occasion of Ramzan, I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur for this change in social development.
Everything of them is inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the governance and people of the five states for fulfilling this work.
We are very well aware that we have to work hard to do some good work in personal life or in social life.
If I don't know what's wrong, I've been working for a long time to fix it.
This way changes physical and mental.
It's the same thing as cleanliness.
Some bad habits have become our habits.
Everybody has to attract attention.
The inspirational events will also be recalled.
I am happy that cleanliness is no longer just a government program.
It is taking the form of a movement of the people in the society.
When people associated with governance take this task forward with the participation of the people, the energy increases naturally.
I remember a good incident in the last days that I want to tell you.
The incident took place in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their goal was to build 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that people and local administration have successfully completed the work of making 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 thousand villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, through letters, all these suggestions come in the astronomy.
It is important to be aware of democracy and that is why it is important to recall the incidents that have hurt democracy and encourage goodwill for democracy.
On June 25, 1997, a black day that cannot be forgotten by any Indian who loves democracy.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voice of the opponents was shut down.
Jaiprakash Narayan and other dignitaries of the country were sentenced.
The system of justice has not been relieved from the terrible situation.
The newspaper was completely unusable.
Todays journalists, students of the world and people working on democracy recall the black day and are constantly trying to increase awareness about democracy and this effort should continue.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
Atal ji had written a poem in the year of emergency and described the mental conditions of those poems.
We have to make this heritage stronger.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud by lifting his head in the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world became accomplished.
People from the sea to the mountain welcomed the rays of sun through yoga in the morning.
Is there any Indian who will not be proud
It is not that Yoga had not been practiced before, but today when Yoga has been tied to the bottom of the world, Yoga has become the cause of connectivity.
Almost all the countries of the world have taken this opportunity of Yoga to their own.
On the one hand, in China, the Great Wall of China, people have practiced Yoga at Machupichu, the World Heritage site of Peru at a height of 2,400 metres above the sea level.
People's shadow of the Ifall Tower in France.
More than four thousand people have joined Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
India-Afghan Friendship Dam in Herat, Afghanistan has given India a new gift of friendship.
There have been seventy places in a small country like Singapore and they have launched a campaign over a week.
The United Nations has released ten postal stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Headquarters of the United Nations have been organised in association with Yoga Experts.
The UN employees, all over the world, are participating in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, about fifty thousand people have come together to create a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in Yoga events in Lucknow.
But for the first time I was fortunate to join the rain.
Our soldiers have also practiced yoga in Siachen where Minus lives in twelve, thirty-five, forty degrees temperature.
Whether it is our armed forces, be it BSF, IT-BP, C-R-P-Fhoke, C-I-SF, everybody has joined hands with their duties.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family must share their photographs.
Some TV channels carried this thing forward.
I have received a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been collected by the Prime Ministers App.
A few days ago I had the opportunity to go to a very dear organisation.
For a few days in Kerala, the efforts of the PNPNicker Foundation have created a habit of reading people, people are encouraging book reading and reading.
I had a chance to go to the beginning of it and I was also told that we don't break the flowers, give books.
I'm good.
This time I also remembered the fact that I had moved away from the center of attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I made a behaviour in the government that we wouldn't break, nor would welcome with silver.
He'll be romantic to Khadi's grown-up.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of all, but when I came here, I went to that habit.
But go to Kerala and awaken that habit again.
And I'm going to give a notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
Flower breeding is very low.
I'm gonna have to handle it once.
But if I book it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a family member.
When I went to London, Britain's queen, ueen Elizabeth invited me to diet.
How many years have passed since ueen Elizabeth has taken care of Mahatma Gandhi's role.
And he showed me very happy to go.
When I was looking, I don't know if he wanted me to touch.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become part of his life and has become part of his history.
I believe that these habits don't change overnight and sometimes they have to be inspired.
However, this should be higher, the effort should be made.
Now I can't say that I went somewhere and somebody broke the flower, then I won't tell him, I can't do it.
But anyway, there will be discussions, but it will change slowly.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work in becoming the Prime Minister.
I have to be drowned in files, but I have made my habit, I have read some letters from the letters that I have received and this is how I get a chance to protect people from connectivity.
Different kinds of people have letters.
I think I'm reading a letter before.
A far southern Tamil Nadu's housewive, Aurulmozhi, wrote a letter.
What are you writing in this letter, I thought of handling my world, handling children's studies so that there is some financial support in the world.
Similarly, I started taking some loans from the bank in the Mudra Yojana and buying some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, I heard that the government has started some kind of system called E-Marketplace.
So I've registered myself with the investigation.
Anyone who wants to supply any goods to the government can have electric bulbs, can ask for supply of dustbins, Jharu, Chairs and tables, you can register whatever you want to sell.
He wrote that first I got the leaflet from the Mudra Yojana and started my business and then in the e-GEM, I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office PMO.
It was an unknown news to me, I want to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He said he bought thermos and got 1600 payments.
Yeah, that's Empowerment.
It is transparency, development and entrepreneurship is also increasing.
Government E-Marketplace - GEM.
I would like to say that the number of those who want to sell something to the government continues to increase.
I understand that this is a unique example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and its objective is Minimum Price and Maximum, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we can proudly gain the success of the space science.
This is the specialty of India, Yoga is connected to the soil of our country and our country is also in remote space missions.
Earlier, in sports, India has achieved a lot of success in science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on space.
It was a long time ago that ISRO launched 30 nanosatellites with Cartosat-2 satellites.
These satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America besides India.
And these nano satellites of India will provide a lot of benefits to the farmers and the farmers in the field of agriculture.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched the GSAT-19.
Imagine how big our scientists have founded in space research.
On June 19, a thousand days of Mars Mission.
You all remember, for this Mars Mission, we were successfully set up at the orbit and its tenure was fixed for six months.
It was six months old.
But is our scientists extraordinary skills that have crossed a thousand days after six months.
Our scientific journey to fulfil this one thousand days is a great success in our space research.
Our younger generations are brightening their skills and their physical capabilities in the field of learning and sports.
This day, Indias Badminton player in Indonesia and Spain has enhanced the dignity of the country as Kidambi.
I congratulate Shrikanth and his coach on this occasion.
T.
Sportspersons play an important role in development.
Sports plays an important role in the development of integral personality.
There is no shortage of neighbors in the country.
If the family is inclined towards sports, it should be encouraged.
Once again, the countrymen, the festival of rains and festivals gives specialty to this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy Ramadan month has begun.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramadan, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the world, especially to the Muslim community in this holy month.
During the Ramadan, special emphasis is given on prayer, spirituality and kindness.
We are very fortunate to have created a tradition that the people of India can be proud of.
We can proudly proudly be one hundred and fifty crore Indians that India is the people of all the communities of the world.
This is a country that believes in God or Nastika who worships statues or who opposes idols, concepts of all kinds of thoughts, pujas and traditions have enjoyed the trick to live together.
And whatever religion, community, thinking or tradition, it gives us one message - peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred Ramadan month will help in furthering this stream of peace, unity and harmony.
I'm greetings again.
Last time when I used to play Mann Ki Baat, I used to use a word, especially the youngsters told me to do something new, to get out of the journal with a new feeling.
And this is the age to live like a little risk, to face hardships.
I'm glad many people gave me feedback.
Everyone inspired me to talk to me personally.
There are so many messages that I can't read everything, I can't hear all the messages sent.
But I have seen how much in my eyes, some are trying to learn songs, some are playing with new instruments, some are trying to teach new things using YouTube, some are trying to teach new languages, some are teaching cooking, some are learning dances, some are learning dances, some are writing poems.
My reading habits were almost closed.
That's why I tried to read on this holiday.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be done for the benefit of India, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail.
I have been inspired by the life of Bhagwan Singh, who has done many things at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to say something on this occasion.
I am glad that todays youngsters wish to know about our history, our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar had written the book Manji Birth Anniversary in jail.
He used to write poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small house.
How much trouble was tolerated for independence.
When I read Savarkar ji's Manji Birth Anniversary, I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There's a light and sound shaw that's very inspiring.
There is no such state of Hindustan, there is no language-speaking person who has not enjoyed black money for freedom, has not lost his life in the cellular jail of Andaman.
If you ever get the opportunity, you must go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, 5th June is the first Monday.
And this year's theme of Nations is Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, Back to Basics.
And who else is better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi often said that one must be careful of the world on not see, that is, our duty is to think about the world we have not seen.
After getting tired, opening the windows of the house and breathing in fresh windows brings a new life.
When our body is formed in the five planets, when it is connected to the five planets then a new life and a new evolution is transmitted in our body itself.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't tied it in a rope.
After that, you must see that whenever you join with different natural conditions, a new consciousness will emerge within you.
And that is why on 5th June, we should have our own campaigns all over the world to connect with nature.
We are getting some of the results that our ancestors have worked to protect the environment.
If we preserve the environment, our next generation will get the results.
The world and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
We are told here - Mother Land: son Ahm Prithvibe:
The sacred one among us is for our world.
The earth is our mother and we are his children.
If we recall Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were three in the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern words, modern arguments.
I have news from different states this time.
With the arrival of rains, a big campaign of planting trees starts in almost all the states.
Crores of trees are planted.
The entire world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, on 21st June, the World Yoga Day has expanded all over the country and people are joining.
On the one hand, many powers that differ in the world are showing its distortion, at this time, the World Yoga Day is a big contribution of India.
Through Yoga, we have tied the whole world in one thread.
The way Yoga tied the body, mind, intellect and soul together today, Yoga is also bounding the world together.
In this situation, Yoga has a big role to play in providing stress-free life.
Yoga is not only a exercise but also a healthy catalysis mixture of body, mind and justice and it is possible to feel this synergy only through yoga exercise.
Two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
A funny proposal.
This is the third International Day of Yoga, I urge the three generations of one family to exercise together on this third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is grandmother or grandmother, parents, sons and daughters should exercise together for three generations and upload its pictures.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, a fortunate mixture of Yoga will show a new direction.
I am grateful for this proposal, and I believe that as we have launched the Selfie with Dougter, and have created a pleasant experience, the pictures of these three generations of yoga will create an emergencies across the country and the world.
You must send a picture to MyGov through the Narendra Modi App where people of three generations are doing yoga together.
It'll be tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow, which will be a beautiful tomorrow's guarantee.
I'm inviting you all.
There are about three weeks left for International Yoga Day.
Start your habit from today.
You should also spread about Yoga for three weeks comfortably, extend and include people.
This is a movement of a kind of private health care.
I invite all of you to participate in this.
The day you gave me the responsibility of working as the chief servant, and from the Red Fort I had the opportunity to keep my first words on August 15, I told you about cleanliness.
From that day onwards, I have visited different parts of India.
Today, on Modi ji, on TV and on social media, I am observing that wherever you are going, everybody is paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted cleanliness as a mission.
Young people are also aware of cleanliness with the elders.
Sometimes the little ones have saved them by watching the jewellery .
The cleanliness that you have started from the valley of Kashi has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right to say that wherever I am going, there is a government cleaning work, but nowadays a festival of cleanliness starts in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
The remaining preparations will be made to welcome the Prime Minister, but the first will be Swachhta.
It will enjoy any sanitation lover automatically.
I would like to thank everyone for emphasizing this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
It's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji, when you go to any invitee, tell me, if you invite me, then I will fix my way on the basis of what level of cleanliness, how many tons of jungles you will present me.
Deaf is very good, but I have to think.
Somehow, it's right to be a movement, and as a gift, a few tons of jewellery will be cleaned instead of other things.
How many people we'll save from sickness.
How big humanity will work.
Once I consider it as wealth, we will have a new way of waste management.
Youngsters associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans and create new instruments.
It is expected that the dry waste in these four thousand cities will be thrown into blue Dustbin and wet waste in green Dustbin.
Make the waste of kitchens like vegetables skins , skins , eggs , leaves of trees and plants - all wet waste - green dustbins .
If you remember the green color of the food, then you will remember what to do with Green Dustbin.
And the remaining wastes like unnecessary papers, iron, card boards, glasses, cloths, plastics, polythenes, rubber and other components of dry wastes - which are not used to recycle, are generally used in bluedustbins.
I believe that we can make such a habit, if we have to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji's cleanliness.
Today, I would like to say with pride that if a person is mentally retarded then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
In the past, you must have heard the news that the smelling Barsova beach of Mumbai has become a clean and clean Barsova beach today.
But it wasn't a sudden that a citizen laboured for 80-90 weeks and changed the picture of the Barsova beach and removed thousands of tons of dirt and made Barsova beach clean, clean and beautiful.
And Versova Residence Volunteer has taken over its full responsibility.
An individual, Mr. Afroz Shah, has been able to work with all power since October 2015 and gradually many people are involved in this work and it takes the form of a mass movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
He was the first Indian to be awarded the Champions of the Earth Award.
I knew that the local women gave the most leadership to this work.
They took mosquitoes to create awareness among the people, every street, every household and every household inspired everyone to do this.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I also congratulate the officers of Jammu and Kashmir for making a block open defecation free and for a beautiful launch.
My dear countrymen, the work done by the present government for the last three years has been consistently discussed in newspapers, TV channels and social media in the last 15 days.
Three years ago, you gave me the charge of the chief servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I am also grateful to all those people who have given critical and important feedback, who have got the opportunity to take into account the misunderstanding, deficiency, etc.
For an aware nation, this remark is very important for an aware nation.
My dear countrymen, I and a common citizen like you have the same effect in the minds of an ordinary citizen.
There are hundreds of families who wrote this to me.
As a common man, as a common citizen, it has had a special impact on my mind, this event has encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar Saheb.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment in love with nature.
I extend my best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And we have come forward with a lot of joy and joy of children, the aspirations of the younger generation and the feelings of the elders.
Every time the input for Mann Ki Baat is being analysed by the government.
What kind of complaints, what kind of feelings are there, what kind of feelings are there.
Overall, the nature of the people is to advise others.
In the train, if there's somebody to go to the bus, then do it immediately.
But when I tried to see them carefully, I was sorry.
Most of the people have suggested, they have tried to reach me, who have really done something in their lives.
They have tried to do some good work according to their understanding, energy, capability and opportunities.
And when I realized this, I thought these suggestions weren't simple.
These are from the serpent's feelings.
Some people think that wherever they are working, where they are going to work, if they listen to them then there can be a broader form of it and it can benefit many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, I remember and very happy.
I have never been able to think that in our country, especially the younger generations have been working in this regard for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some socio-economic organisations have been working in this regard, but I can know that the youth of my country are also working in this regard.
Many have sent me a video.
There are many places where the roti bank is running.
People gather roti in roti bank, deposit vegetables and collect them for their own sakes.
Those who are giving, they don't like it, and those who are doing it don't seem to be small.
This is an example of how the society works through cooperation.
The last day of April.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both states have been trying to reach new goals of development and have been working towards the development of the country.
And in both the states, the princes come together and their livelihoods in every field of society continue to inspire us.
On the occasion of the inauguration of both the states, we should resolve to reach the heights of our states, our society, our cities, our families, 75 years after the independence of 2022.
It should be planned to transform this project and all citizens should further enhance their cooperation.
The warmth in our country has come to be felt in March-April.
When I was suggesting people in Mann Ki Baat, I used to suggest what should be done in this summer and that was what the people had given.
It's not a new thing, but it's a special time to re-estimate it.
And I have seen that the kids of the family are doing this very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, they go to see whether they have water in the utensils ten times a day.
And if the birds come, they're looking at it.
I think this is a game, but it's really a strange way to awaken condolences to the boys.
In our country, we live together in the form of animals and birds, in their colors, but we must focus on conservation and conservation.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a hundred years of Dharmaguru Daudhi Bohra Samaj was completed.
He lived for 103 years.
And to celebrate his hundred years, the Bohra Samaj runs a big campaign to save the climbers through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate this campaign.
Nearly thousands of bird feeders spread them to the corner of the world.
This campaign has taken place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I am so busy that I forget to give some water to those who come to my house in the summer days, those who have papers, milk, vegetables and postman.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our youngsters are enjoying living from the rest of the zone.
Their parents have reinforced them in a single-stop.
Some people go through extreme opposites, but most people live this life of convenience.
Now the test is over, many plans have been made to enjoy holidays.
It's very funny if you get hot in the summer.
But I want to talk about how to take your vacation as a friend.
I believe some people must change my words and tell me.
Sometimes there is a difference between watching something on TV, reading or listening to the acquaintance.
Well, testing can be efficient, let's get out of the restzone.
We're a middle family, a happy family.
Have you ever thought that without conserving the seat, you can take a ticket and sit in a second class room of the train and travel 24 hours.
Ever feel it, I don't tell you to repeat it, but do it one or two times.
In the evening, take your footwear, take volleyball or other sports stuff to a very poor settlement.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you'll see, you'll feel that you have never had the pleasure of playing this life before.
When there will be an opportunity to interact with the children living in the society, do you think that how big changes will come in the lives of those children
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several voluntary organizations are working for this service.
Sometimes, a number of summits are organised for Personality Development and many developments can be included in this.
If you are participating in the Samar camp, you are doing the course of personality development, you go to those people of the society who have been deprived of all these courses and teach them what you have learned.
How to do these things, you can teach.
We are inspiring that technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six households together, but the difference between them has increased so much that imagined.
Everyone has been busy somewhere through new technology.
To be together is a reform, unity is power.
Secondly, I want to tell you what you don't want to learn new things
I try to make good results, lose myself, I get filled with some coaching class in the weekend, I'm worried about the forecast.
Sometimes we're scared, our younger generations are not going to be robots.
A little bit of emphasis can be given on skill improvement.
You can try to spend some time with yourself, somebody can learn instruments like Tamil, Telegu, English, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages. If we see the differences in our country, somebody will find some friends in surrounding us.
If you don't want to swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, maybe it's not a good picture, but you can try to swim in the paper.
You want to learn to run a car, do you ever want to learn the auto-rickshaw
You will see this new experiment, its skills will also give you happiness and you will be able to get rid of the one-and-a-half-hour bonded life.
Get out of the past life, do something, guys.
This is the chance to live.
You think all the exams are over, I'll learn only when you go to a new career, but there's no chance.
Then you'll be in trouble, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn your magic, then at least learn the magic of it.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know what you don't know, you'll be beneficial.
Your inner human features will be awakened and there will be a lot of improvements.
I'm telling myself, we can't imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
However, whenever I go there, the practices of that place, and the feelings, understanding, discussions and asking the people, then the joy of seeing that new place increases.
Stay at the same place for four days.
Go to other places and stay for three days.
You can learn from it.
Where did you go
You should share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in Digital Currency.
But if you refresh someone else or someone else and that new person translates the money three times, you will be able to do this thing.
Your Account will get ten rupees from the government.
If you do 20 people a day, you'll get 200 rupees to be in the evening.
Businessmen may also get income, the supporters may also get income.
This will be your obligation to build a Digital India by October 14.
Now the red skull is gone, so nobody can say that the red skull in the heart is probably out.
I got an intersting phone call.
The phone also expresses fears, but this phone indicates that the common man did not like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Choubey.
I want to say something about the Red Backen Light Ban of the Government.
I don't have to bite the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for anybody.
I would like to thank you very much for this.
Grandfathers are getting cleaner thanks for this.
The Prime Minister said that logistics burning in the train is part of the government system.
But we have to try to overcome this idea.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that our history, our culture, our heritage must be remembered again and again.
We save energy from this, inspire.
This year, we are celebrating the auspicious year of Saint Ramanujacharya.
It is sufficient to celebrate centuries in many countries of the world, but India is such an ancient country that we have the opportunity to recall thousands of years or more old memories.
Thousands of years ago, he had taken the campaign to enter the temple and succeeded.
We are so lucky that some of the great men have been born in the country to break the faults of all ages.
We can inspire him to take a collective effort for social unity while celebrating the birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya.
The Government of India will release a postal stamp in the memory of Saints on May 15, 2019.
I remind the Saint Ramanujacharya with respect, I salute him.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow is another significance.
This day is celebrated in many places of the world as 'Service Day'.
And when the labour day comes to light, the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be remembered, it is natural.
Nearly a few people know that today we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the comfort that workers have received.
Babasahebs role in labour welfare is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramanujacharya, I also remember the great saint and socialist Jagatguru Vasaveshwar of Karnataka in the twentieth century.
In the twentieth century, he spoke about labour and labour in Kannada.
He spoke in Kannada: Kay Koy Koy Kailas.
This means that through labour, you can reach the Alaikailas of Shiva.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it is natural to remember Dattupant Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days later we will celebrate intellectuality.
All the Buddhists of the world celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha is a unique symbol in the life of Mahatma Ashoka.
It is especially used for our neighbouring countries.
May Indias neighbouring countries continue to collaborate and develop.
Several projects are being undertaken internationally.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The Satellite will facilitate greater economic and other developmental areas of South Asian countries.
This will help in the progress of our entire South Asian Satellite, including the mapping of natural resources, telemedicine, education and information technology connectivity and people-to-people relations.
In order to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia, an important step from India is an invaluable gift, an integral example of our responsibility towards South Asia.
I extend my best wishes to all those countries that are connected to the South Asian Satellite Scheme for their special efforts.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
There is some comfortable environment for those who have been tested and those families are still under pressure.
But at such a time, I will say that listen to the words that I had spoken to the opponents of Mann Ki Baat last time.
You must use those things at the time of the test.
Today, 26th March.
On 26th March, Bangladesh Independence Day.
Historical fight against injustice, unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh led by Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I extend my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh, brothers and sisters of Independence.
And I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend of Bangladesh and we will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Tagore, his memory, both of us are the heritage of our two countries.
The National Music of Bangladesh is also written by Gurudev Tagore.
A very interesting information about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first person to be awarded the award, but also to him by the British.
And when in 1919, when the British carried out terror in Jallianwala Bagh, Tagore was among those great men who had resisted and at this time when a child of twelve years had a deep impact on this incident.
The brutal murder of Jallian Wala Bagh brought a new face in the life of that boy who walked in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagwad is our beloved, inspired by all of us, the martyr Bhagat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh and his partner Sukhdev and Rajguru were buried by the British and we all know that on 23rd March, there was no satisfaction in the service of Bharat Mata on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were sacrificed for the freedom of Mother India.
And those three braves still inspire us.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The whole British administration was scared of these three youths.
They're imprisoned, okay, on the day of Fancy, but what can be done about them, the British inspired.
And that's why on March 24, where the fucking fucking funny was on 23rd.
It's hiding, it's not common.
And then their dead body was brought to Punjab today and the British were quietly burnt.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there, I felt the tremor of that land.
And I will surely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to go to Punjab, go to the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagt Singh and Batukeshwar Datta.
At this time, freedom movement, its rapidity, its insurgency increased.
On one hand, brave men like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth of the armed revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Satyagraha in Champaran.
This year, the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha is completed.
In Indias freedom struggle, Gandhijis thinking and Gandhis style were first seen in Champaran.
This was a transformation in the entire movement of independence, especially from the perspective of the congressional system.
This festival, Satyagraha of Champaran, Khada Satyagraha, Haratal of the factory workers in Ahmedabad, and all these were showing the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and functioning style.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917, he gave a new inspiration to the country by going to a small village in Bihar.
Today, we cannot valuate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a person who returned to India in 1915 had worked only for two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organizational strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the nerves of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the poverty against the British administration, the inspiring, inspiring and bringing in the field of war.
So we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, the Champaran Satyagraha's Gandhiji, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a deep study for a person who has recently entered the part of life.
We can learn from him how to work and how to work and how Gandhiji had done it.
And he was a time when Gandhiji sent everyone to the village, be it Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani, whom we heard.
On the one hand the prison is filled and on the other hand the construction work is done .
There was a wonderful balance between Gandhi's functioning.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be the meaning of uncomfort, what can be the meaning of unemployment in front of such a large empire - Gandhiji had shown a complete new idea through words, not only by words, but through a successful presentation.
Everybody's joy in the interests - by empowering this mantra, for the country and for the society, it is the endeavour to fulfil the dreams of those great people who have given their lives for the freedom of the country.
And in this 21st century there are Indians who don't want to change, who don't want to participate in the progress of the country.
This will give the seeds of a New India-New India to the progress of 125 crore Indians.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve patients.
Our country is the service of Ratna Garbha and Jansevai Lord, this is our birth.
If we look at this idea together, we can understand how powerful it is.
If we talk about India, it is very natural and inevitable that different opinions and visions will emerge.
But it is also true that if the entire country is committed to fulfilling it, then the dreams of a New India can be successful.
It's not necessary that the work is to be done at the budget or government costs.
If every citizen decides to follow the traffic rules, follow the rules of duty, keep the use of petrol and diesel in the week at least one day, then we will be able to make a new India through these small initiatives.
I will see the dreams of India being fulfilled, and I will say that everybody should accomplish their civilizationalism and commitments.
In this way, a New India can be launched.
The year 2022 will be the seventeenth year of Indias independence.
I urge you to follow your lives and commit yourself to this journey from Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I also want to express my gratitude to you.
The BHIM App was launched two and a half months ago, but almost 1. 5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine that this way you can become a big partner of the country's service and a brave soldier can propagate yourself against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
Nearly 125 lakh people have received certain awards for beneficiaries and seventeen thousand people have received certain awards for businessmen.
Let us join this effort to reduce the use of cash transactions and notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I want your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of opinion.
But I have pointed out that there is no lack of interest in sanitation.
I guess how important it is to explain to the common man.
I go through a river every day, where people throw a lot of waste and pollut the river.
This river comes through Rispna pool and our house flows beyond.
In order to keep this river clean, I went to Paradise and talked to the people, mixed, but didn't get much.
I would urge you to send a team here or publish this through the newspaper.
Brothers and sisters, You see how hard a daughter of Ekadash is suffering.
He's so angry to see the fucking fucking shit in the river.
I think it's a good signal.
I want 125 crore people to be angry with the embarrassment.
Once there is anger, when there is satisfaction, when there is anger, we can do something in the campaign against illiteracy.
It's a good thing that the singer has expressed his anger, suggested to me and at the same time told me that he tried a lot, but failed.
Since the Swachhta movement has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is connected to it in a positive way.
It took the form of a movement.
The hatred towards evil is increasing slowly.
Be it awakening, active participation, movement, it has its own significance.
This movement is possible in a holistic way.
It's hard, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness that has come in the youth of the country, in the youth, in the children, in the students, in the youth is indicating a good result.
Today, I would like to tell the people of those countries who are listening to the singers of Mann Ki Baat that the singer should speak to us.
I don't have half of my stomach, and I'm gonna leave it there.
Sometimes we've seen how much we waste our food.
Have you ever seen that if you don't waste, then how many poor people can fill the stomach.
There's nothing to understand about this.
Normally when mother presents food to small children in our house , she says that take as much as you can eat .
There are some efforts in this marm, but despite this, indifference in this regard is a social disorder.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if it is saved, the family will also get financial benefits.
The thinking is good for the society , but this thing is that family will also be benefitted by this .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youths who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youngsters of our country have worked like this.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much as we'll eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep a little empty stomach .
When the matter of health comes then I say , ' World Health Day ' on 7th April .
The United Nations has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage for All by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has focused on the depression on World Health Day on 7th April.
According to a hierarchy, more than thirty-two crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is a lot of our surroundings, but we don't understand it, and perhaps I feel confused to talk about it openly.
I want to tell my countrymen, there is no depression that cannot be freed from him.
He starts getting rid of a psychological campus.
The first thing is to express it without superstition.
With your friends, with his parents, with his brothers and sisters, tell the teacher that what is happening within you.
Did you ever think why the man is doing this
You must be sure, these are the first symptoms of depression.
If someone wants to keep himself away from the middle of everyone, keep in mind - don't let him be alone.
Or let him live with whom he likes to live.
Encouraging him to speak openly in funny words, find out what he's hiding in his heart.
In diseases like diabetes, such as physically weakening, depression reduces the consciousness of the people, bites courage, reduces the strength of fighting against life and destroys all our livelihoods.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start resolving the problems of the service.
If you can commemorate yourself with others, you can serve and if you can do it selflessly, see if your mind is lightened in the uneasiness.
Yoga habits, but the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective way of liberation from mental discomfort, liberation from compassion and joy.
International Yoga Day is celebrated on 21st June every year.
If you have to give some suggestions on the occasion of International Day of Yoga, send me all those ideas through my mobile app.
Keep writing as much poems, songs as you can with yoga so that there is an inspiration among the common people.
This time I will say something to my mothers and sisters, there is a lot of talk about health care.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
That is why the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
During pregnancy, during pregnancy, during pregnancy and post-public child reproduction, the maternity leaves were first 12 weeks.
In this context, only two-three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, the wealth of the country will be.
New Year Festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
The New Year is celebrated on the occasion of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi on New Year in Andhra-Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh in Ayodhya, Sanvastra Puja in Ayodhya, Jud Cold in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadh.
A large country is full of diversity in India.
My best wishes to all of you for the New Year.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The cry of birds brings a humorous joy.
Not only flowers but fruits also brighten in the branches of the trees.
The summer fruits are also seen in the spring.
Similarly, in the field of farming, yellow mustard is expected to be planted in the breeding field.
The red flower of Palass indicates the arrival of Holi.
This time, the climate change has been a very beautiful description.
He wrote: The forest is boiling, the mustard is boiling, the skull is boiling, the kuh-kuh.
When the colour of nature touches the brightness of the sage, people also enjoy that.
Festivals of spring-panchami, Mahashivratri and Holi make the lives of man colorful.
And that's why I say something about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji thanked you very much, you have recalled the example of India's pride.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting themselves from diseases, connecting the world, inspiring knowledge, technology and science have proved their role.
On 15th February, 2017, a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads over the world.
And we know that in a few years, ISRO has successfully completed some unprecedented projects.
ISRO has set up a world record for space missions recently after the success of the Mars Mission, Mangalyaan in Mangalgraha.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together to Maharashtra.
It is also heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
This is not just ISRO, but a historic achievement for the entire India.
The cost-sustainable space programme of ISRO has shown a miracle to the world and has appreciated the success of Indian scientists in opening the world.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, the new satellite Cartosat-2D will help us in this regard.
We've sent some pictures to our satellite room.
That's what you're doing.
Our young scientists, our women scientists, have been leading these campaigns.
This rare collaboration of youngsters and women is a glorious aspect of ISROs success.
I extend my greetings to the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common man, they have always kept the goal of using space science for the service of the nation and are creating new achievements every day.
The more we appreciate these scientists, their entire team, the less it will be.
Shobhaji had another question and it was about Indias security.
India has successfully tested the Ballisticinterceptor missiles for defence.
In the interception technology, the Specific Satellite has successfully driven about a hundred kilometres away from the ground during its experimental flight.
This is an important achievement in defence.
When I see new technologies, I see a new scientific success, we are happy.
And asking has played a big role in the development of human life.
And whosoever does not allow him to ask in the form of asking, he also transmits questions, finds new questions, creates new questions.
That's why I'm asking you to be the reason for a new discovery.
They're not quiet until the question is answered.
And if we look at the stream of development of human life for thousands of years, we can say that there is no flaw in this development of human life.
It's impossible to finish.
Continuous efforts are being made to know the principles of creation of the universe.
New science, new technologies are born from them.
And every technology, every new form of science gives a new generation.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about science, whenever we talk about the hard work of the scientists, I recall that in this Mann Ki Baat programme, I have said that younger generations should be attracted to science.
There are many scientists in the country.
Todays scientists will launch a sustainable transformation in the future generations.
In view of the requirements of the common man, when science researches and finds something, how it will be used for the people, science becomes a common man, then science becomes great.
Here I saw an innovation to use our daily poor fishermen.
All such innovations were found from this competition.
Technologies are also going to be intensified.
Technologies have become an integral part of life.
The rate of digital transactions in India is increasing.
In particular, the youth are removing digital payments from their mobile phones.
I think it's a good sign.
Laki Grahak Yojana and DG Dhan Abhiyan are getting a big boost.
It's almost two months since these two schemes, 15 thousand people are getting a prize of Rs. 1,000 per day.
A large number of people have been awarded one lakh rupees in this scheme.
More than four thousand businessmen have got fifty thousand rupees.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi App, Mr. Mahisur, is happy to note that he has received a prize of Rs.
And then I think you should share with Mr. Shreshriman satisfaction.
I am so happy to know that, satisfactory, your name and work have been very happy to all of us.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become the Ambassador of the Laki Grahak Yojana.
Travelers of the car are also motivated to be aware of the digital system and many more have started participating in the digital system.
A young friend from Maharashtra, Puja-Nemad, how is the use of Rupay card, e-wallet in a youngster's family, and how happy they are talking to their friends in this regard.
One lakh rupees are important for him and he is also encouraging others to take it to a mission.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Give me a reminder.
A few days ago, Babasaheb left the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
Remembering him, you also learn to upload at least 125 BHIM apps.
Teach me how to deal with it.
So I want to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had laid.
125 crore people will have to reach home and reach the BHIM App.
The movement that has been going on for the last two-three months has been achieved in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
Today I want to tell you a pleasure.
Our farmers brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the food grains.
This year most of the cereals have been produced due to the hard work of our farmers.
Everything indicates that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This year, the kind of crops in the fields seem to be celebrating Pongal or Vaishakhi festival every day.
This year more than seven crore tons of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
Eight percent more than the last records of our farmers were written.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I would like to thank the farmers of the country especially.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have heard about the poor and about two and a half lakh nineteen lakh hectares of pulses have been grown.
This is not just the production of pulses but also the biggest service to the poor of the country by the farmers.
They are grateful to me for the hard work done by the farmers brothers and sisters of our country, for making records of pulses.
My dear countrymen, some or the other programmes are going on in our country by the government, by the society, by various institutions, by the organisations, for cleanliness.
In some way or the other, there is a sense of awareness about cleanliness.
In the Warangal of Telangana, the importance of cleanliness was straightforwardly envisaged in the closed houses.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
The toilet pits of six houses have been cleaned and the officers have shown themselves how to open the twin pit toilets.
They also showed how complications are in the toilets, and there is no other complications or irregular mental obstacles to cleaning it from elimination.
We also work for small sanitation as we can clean the toilet holes.
For the family of six members, a Standard Twin Pittoilet is filled in about five-six years.
Our farmers are well aware of NPK.
Different government departments and different types of Swachhta philosophy.
On the first side of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second side of March, the Ministry of Innovation and the Ministry of Jalsampad, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will conduct Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a particular work, the entire country gets a new energy, the confidence increases.
We all welcomed the kind of achievements that our disabled players have made in the Reo Paralympics.
India lost Pakistan on the Blind T-20 World Cup Festival organised this month for the second time as a global champion, the pride of the country has grown.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the success of our disabled friends.
I have always thought that the Divyang brothers and sisters are accomplished, concerted, courageous and determined.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, our country's girls are not lagging behind in any field.
They have moved on foot and are proud of the country in their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons have won silver medals at the Asian Ragbisven's Corps.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao movement is going on at a rapid pace.
This is no longer a government project, it is now a social awareness and a public education campaign.
In the last two years, this project has also been linked to the common man.
The burning sensation that is being obtained from every corner of the country is compulsory to think of the common man and it has been changing the mindset of the people about the old traditions that have been going on for years.
When it is reported that the festival has emerged on the birth anniversary of the daughter-in-law, it is very happy.
This kind of negative thinking towards the daughter-in-law leads to social recognition.
I am aware that Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to shut down the girl marriage by running a special campaign.
More than 175 battalions have been closed so far.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened in the Sukna Samridhi Yojana.
Efforts are being made to educate the children in every village in every household of the country under the Har Ghar Dastak Yojana in Madhya Pradesh.
Your Children are driven to encouraging their writings by filling them back to school without finishing their education in Rajasthan through the 'Your Children' School.
New imaginations are also connected to it.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with it.
I know something from you.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poor people of the village are reaching me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors had decorated our seasonal, economic and social systems in such a way that there is no stagnation in society.
In the last few days, we celebrated many festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who has created innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival even after thousands of years.
He can still become an example of any problem, inspire.
Anyone who can find solutions to the present problem from Sri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, Sarathy can be persuaded to work on the ground.
Sometimes climb the mountains and sometimes stop eating... so you can feel innovation.
Today, when I am talking to you, my mind is moving towards both the fronts.
One Sudarshan Chakra holder Mohan, the other chakra holder Mohan.
Sudarshan Chakra Dharani Mohan left the shore of Yamuna and lived in Dwarka city on the shore of Gujarat and spent the last days of his life on the shore of Mohan Yamuna on the shore of the sea.
Hundreds of years ago, Sudarshan Chakra Mohan had used his own intellect, commitment, courage and wisdom to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On 2nd October, 1869, only one person was born in a small house called Kirti Mandir, which showed a new path to human history.
Mill labourers who were not paid the gains, he served them.
The poor, helpless, sick and hungry people were considered to be the duty of life.
He used to serve the leprosy victims in order to prove the misunderstandings of the common man about leprosy and inspired others.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to leave to help him.
He not only stressed on service but also knew the importance of self-sufficiency in service.
The word 'SEBA' will be comfortable only if it is done with joy, then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the real pleasure of 'Sant Sukha' is also inspired by this idea.
It is easier to understand if we study Gandhiji's life.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity were the only thoughts.
African Phoenix Farm - Whether it is Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he emphasized the importance of Community Building in social development in a fundamental thinking everywhere.
I am fortunate to have the opportunity to pay homage to all the works of Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji also emphasized the importance of service thinking as well as organizational energy.
We want to use these two ideas of social service and social integration, community service and community collaboration.
Will we come and go, can we accept it
There is no obstacle, whoever comes to mind, in a sense of dedication, in a sense of dedication, it will be a unique pleasure.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news on this occasion.
Haripura panels were specially attractive.
You recall that there was an edition of session in Haripura in Gujarat, where the events of the Presidential election of Subhash Chandra Bose were recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura session in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited Shri Nandlal Bose, the then President of Shantiniketan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and showcase this art work during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose architecture decorates our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
His artistic artistic discussions have immortalized Nandlal Bose along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose reviewed the villages surrounding Haripura and then made some participants regarding rural India.
This precious art was discussed in Venice.
Once again, with the congratulations of Gandhiji for a hundred and a half years, I urge every Indian to make some promises.
For the country, for the society, there is a need to do something for each other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true tribute to Bapu.
You must remember that for the last few years, we have launched Swachhata Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we have to focus on plastic.
All the people of the society are encouraging this campaign.
Many of my businessmen, brothers and sisters, have put a placard in the shop, where it is written that the buyer has come with his throne.
It can save money and also provide its partnership to protect the environment.
This time on 2nd October, when Babapur will run for a hundred and a half years, I will not only dedicate to the nation in open defecation free, but the foundation stone of a new movement against plastic will be laid.
I urge all the communities of the society, every village, every village, every village and every city to join hands pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated in a way to liberate our Mother India from plastic jungles.
Maybe on 2nd October as a special day.
It can be recycle-okay.
It can be used as a fuel.
There is no need to see here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspiring.
My dear countrymen, our culture is well-known, a journal of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch an important thing through a Sanskrit-scholarship, it is a long time ago, but even today it has a great significance.
The fools call the rock a jewel.
Our culture has a lot of respect for food.
Even we have transformed food sciences into sciences.
We all need sustainable and nutritious food, especially for women and newborns.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
Anganwadi servants used to gather a piece of money from all over the country on the day of crops.
The foodgrains were used for making hot food for children and women.
He who is donating this has become an aware citizen and a social worker.
After that, he dedicated himself to this objective and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was thought that the food processing programme should provide sufficient food to the child so that people are aware of this.
This is a very important initiative which can be taken everywhere.
In many states, people have celebrated the Theatre Food Mission.
If there is a birth day, a good day or a commemorative day, then the members of the family go to Anganwadi, school and the family members of their own children by making a tasty, nutritious food and share their joy in everyone.
In this way, a wonderful mix of service and joy can be achieved.
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected both the poor and the rich.
Poshan Abhiyan will be celebrated throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this campaign, collect information and add a new idea.
If you can save one person from malnutrition, then our country will also be able to save it from malnutrition.
This time, when I am thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I believe that there will be a lot of questions on this matter and that is why it has happened.
For the last few weeks, wherever I went and those with whom I have met, Man vis Wild has been relevant.
Through this episode, I have not only become India but also with the youth from all over the world, I have never thought that this place will be created in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought of how many strange things our country and the youth of the world are looking at.
I went to Bhutan last week.
That's what I felt.
Tiger, Lion, I am amazed about how many people can be encouraged.
My firm belief is that now people want to know about the steps taken in India on Climate Justice Oclean Environment.
Did this happen later
Look, there's no secret.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm unveiling this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi, but he used to listen to English, that's why the conversation would have become easier and that's the job of technology.
After this show, I have pointed out that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to natural and wildlife.
I said before, I'm saying again, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will grow.
On 15th August, I requested you all from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places of India, 15 places for 100 of tourism, see, discuss, take a family and spend some time there.
Your life, your thoughts will increase.
Last month, there was a chance to release the country's census.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was very hard.
Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
A resolution was taken here by expressing grief over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
The commitment was to double the number of tigers all over the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, where we have achieved the goal at a rapid pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
Not only in India, the number of tigers, but also the number of Protected Area and Community Reserves has increased.
I also remember the lions of the Gir forest in Gujarat when I was expressing the story of Tigersummer.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister in Gujarat, the lion's residence in the forests of Gir was shrinking.
Their numbers were declining.
We've done a lot in Gir.
In 2007, I decided to appoint women's guards.
Infrastructure facilitates improvement in tourism industry.
In the context of nature and wildlife, we focus only on conservation.
This time, we have to think about compassion or compassion on the threshold of conservation.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September 1893
This young Indian sensor was awakened by the brightest speech in the world.
While India was at the forefront of the world, the world is compulsory to find a new India in the words of the great Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
Come, let us build India the strength that Swami Vivekananda had seen in India.
On this occasion, we are going to launch the Fit India Movement across the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be an attractive drive for all the elderly and elderly.
But today I don't know about this in detail.
Wait for 29th August.
And on October 2 for Totally Dedicated Plastic.
With all our strengths, we will be involved in the movement of keeping the house and its surroundings clean.
I believe that this campaign will create a mass movement in the social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new enthusiasm, a new resolve and a new energy.
I waited for your message and advice.
May our path be highlighted in the mantra of joy and service of the heart.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, is a reform that makes the future generation aware of democracy, the responsibility of democracy, the reforms.
However, there is no discussion on the duty of citizens and the officers of citizens in our country, as deeply as it should be, as much as it should be conservative, as it should be widely discussed.
I hope that at every level, at every moment, at the same time, the more power is given on the right, the more important it is.
On both sides of the right and duties, the vehicles of India can be transformed.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, our pilgrimage will be celebrated.
On 30th January, at 11:00 in the morning, we celebrate two minutes of silence and pay homage to the martyrs of the country.
Integrated society, as a country, on 30th January and 11th January, we have to become a common habit to celebrate two minutes of reverence.
On the eve of the Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their family members who have been awarded various bravery indicators.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Saurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Servant Seva Medal.
I urge the youngsters, especially those who are very active in social media, can you do a job
This time, those who have been awarded this honor, ask for an internet and ask for their contacts and send them to your friends.
When we know in detail about their courage, bravery and valour, we are astonished, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when we were happy in the news of the festival and inspiration on 26th January, our soldiers in Kashmir, who are steadfast in the security of the country, who are gallantry due to the loss of basket.
I pay homage and respect to these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am constantly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March, April- This month is the month of examination in every family.
There are one and a half or two children in the world, but the whole family is under pressure from the test.
Families are worried, students are stressed, teachers are stressed - a very different psychological environment in every world.
And I have always been convinced that we should get out of this and that's why I want to talk to the young friends in detail in detail.
When I announced this, many academicians, parents, students sent me a message, sent questions, suggested, listened to pain, stressed and I would like to participate with you today.
I've delivered a telephone from the creation.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but the same question is definitely in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
It should be a festival of zeal and zeal that has been laboured throughout the year.
You have to decide that you think it's a pressure, no please.
And when the festival takes place, the best in us comes out.
During the festival, the society feels its own energy.
During the examination, there should be an atmosphere of festivity in the family and friends around the country.
The entire family should be able to successfully celebrate this festival as a team and see how soon it changes.
It is true that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal, only three-four months are tests and tests.
Every year the responsibility of ourselves is that this three-four months, in their own ways, according to the traditions of ourselves, understand the environment of their own family, make it a festival.
And so I'll tell you smile more score more.
And you have seen that when you're happy, you're comfortable, you're comfortable.
You remember all the views of what Teacher said in Classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems we can't see the experiment in the right way.
I think the test is a question of life and death.
The test means the valuation of what you've read all year.
J.
The brightest philosophy of Kalam.
He wanted to join the Air Force but was unforgettable.
Imagine that if he had been disappointed after this failure then would India have had such a big scientist
It has not only increased the competition among the students, but also increased stress.
I want to know about the present situation and future of educational system.
Your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and commitment are the things you realize in life.
Of course not, you think he's a good doctor, and you're gonna need him.
When you go to a nominee when you get a big case, are you looking for his marksheet
You see his experience, his words and achievements.
That's why sometimes the burden of this number is in the middle of our right path.
Analysis will show that whenever he runs for numbers, he finds the easiest way and concentrates on certain things, but you are getting unprecedented when you face any problem outside the cart.
And that is why sometimes it happens to be extremely successful in testing and we face failure in life.
Richa has produced one more thing, that's a competition.
It's a very big psychological area.
In this regard, we can give examples of Shakeen Tendulkar.
Friends, Whenever you are going to examine every field of life, take care of it, if you used to give two hours time for the testing, have you been able to do it for three hours
In the past, when I thought of getting up, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Shri S.
He helped me in this way.
My mother couldn't pass the tenth examination but if she didn't get her help, I wouldn't have passed the CBSE test.
Beautiful, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who asked me is more.
If you learn to acknowledge, there will be a lot of problems there.
If it doesn't accept it, the way to solve this problem is open.
Hope makes the road difficult.
If we acknowledge the current situation, there is an opportunity to open a new solution.
So acknowledge what you have.
Look, you'll be free.
We talk about the weight of school bags of small children, but sometimes I don't want parents more than the school bags of aspirational children.
Years ago, a familiar person was in the hospital due to heart attack.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about diseases.
Parents, I want to say that sometimes we live in such a way with children.
Did you ever imagine that in the days of the test, I give the child a smile.
You'll see the situation changes.
I got a very funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to say his name.
If you hear the phone details, you can understand why the person doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I did something on my television that I couldn't say my name.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood.
I have lost many times in thinking about what I want to do, what I want to do.
If I spent that time for reading, I could get the same number.
When I tried to duplicate myself, I was caught and I had a lot of friends around me.
I'm telling you the same thing.
So where will you reach
Remember, you're looking for your own way, creating economic obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and using the creative power to duplicate.
If I talk about playing during the examination, everyone will say, how is the Prime Minister
Because the common man thinks that the youngsters will be unaware of reading in sports.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should be active.
If you have a break for five minutes, you'll feel that you're reading too much.
I don't know if everyone likes this, but I'm talking about my trust.
Once a folk song came to see me.
He asked me how long you sleep
I wanted to move, brother, are you a doctor
He said, "No-No, you don't tell me, it's related to your throat to give this answer.
You'll get rest in your lunch card.
I didn't think of my sleep and my throat.
He gave me a simple tower.
Don't forget to do this, so your feelings will be unhappy with me.
Otherwise, on the day the marksheet comes, the parents will be able to see me instead of you.
Then it's gonna work if you slept, don't think that.
Sportspersons have a very funny role in keeping the body active.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, on 1st February this year, the Indian Coast Guard is completing forty years.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their commitment to the nation.
Our Coast Guard has secured its pride in the world's four best coast Guard forces in collaboration with 126 warriors and 62 airplanes built in our country.
Recalling the commitment of the Coast Guard, Ayam Rakshaam, our Coast Guard has always been committed to protecting the maritime boundaries of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard had planned to clean the beaches of our country along with their original funds and thousands of common people were also involved in this work.
Our women pilot officers are at Coast Guard, and they are also evident in handling the gems of the Hovercraft.
Spring Rishtiraj.
Sarasvati is worshipped on spring-punch.
For the organisation of education, they are obliged to worship.
Not only education but also the festival of bravery.
Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
My heartfelt congratulations to the countrymen on this spring-panchmi celebrations.
My dear countrymen, the Mann Ki Baat programme has been filled with a lot of detailed thinking.
Last month, after my Mann Ki Baat was addressed, Mann Ki Baat was heard in regional language.
This effort has achieved great success.
The countrymen have written a letter from far-off places.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to them for this self-inspired effort of Akashwani.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
I don't wish you all a lot of Christmas.
Today is the day to serve, sacrifice and compassion in your lives.
Rescue Christ said, We are not beneficial for the poor, we are recognised for them.
There's a lot of stories about this.
Lord Jesus once stood by a Temple Treasury.
A lot of wealthy people came and donated a lot.
Just after that, a poor widow came and gave two copper money.
On the one hand, both of them don't have any money as copper money.
The birth anniversary of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malaviya ji and the commitment and self-confidence of the people of India, Malaviya ji had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
I pay homage to him on his birth anniversary.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several developmental works in Malaviyaji's peninsula, Banaras.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mammahati Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Benaras Hindu University.
Cancer Centre is being set up for the entire region, not only for the east of Uttar Pradesh, but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, India's address is the birth anniversary of Prime Minister Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Our country's head has also grown up in the field of atomic energy under his leadership.
Atal ji has established an ideal in the role of party leaders, parliamentarians, ministers or Prime Ministers.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
There's a lot of memories in front of the eyes.
This morning, when I travelled, I shared an old video and how Atal ji's affection towards a small worker would be able to see that video.
As a big gift, all the countrymen are going to get the benefits of both the schemes.
Everybody wants to understand and learn each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is launching a programme for encouraging consumers and small businesses to transform e-payment into a habit to enhance the strength of mobile banking.
The scheme for incentives of consumers is the name of the Lacky Consumer Yojana and the name of the Business Yojana - DG-Dhan Abhiyan.
And on 25th December, as a gift to Christmas, one thousand rupees will be deposited in the accounts of 15,000 people through Drawing System.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
This award will be given to 15,000 people every day.
Crores of rupees will reach lakhs of households in 100 days but these gifts will be eligible for those who are mobile banking, e-banking, Rupay card, UPI.
Use the digital transactions, such as USSD, etc.
The DG Dhan Abhiyan is for businessmen.
As the businessmen will connect themselves with this scheme, they will also connect consumers to cashless business.
Businessmen will also be given different awards and the number of these awards will be thousands.
Those who can buy at a cost of more than Rs. 3,000 will not be able to avail the award.
The poor will be able to sell and supplement the money through Feature Phones and Common Phones through USSD and all will be able to get the awards of the scheme.
People from rural areas can win this award without selling through AEPS.
The ten or twelve-class kids in your family can teach you this way well.
It's a very simple task to send the What's App from the mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments and online payments.
In the last few days, cashless trade has increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage this process.
Businesses can easily guess how big this decision is.
Those businessmen who exchange digital transactions will enhance online payments rather than cash in their business, they will be exempted from income tax.
I am aware that the Government of Assam has announced 10 percent reduction in the delivery of Property Taxes and Trade License Fe Digitality.
The branches of the rural bank have decided that 75 of their consumers will be awarded Rs. 50,000 from their Government by reducing two digital transactions from January to March.
5 lakhs have been announced by the Government of Assam through the Uttam Panchayat for Digi-Transfer Scheme, if a village has 100 digital transactions by March 31, 2017.
The Government of Assam has decided to give Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers who will fully adopt digital methods for procurement of seeds and salt under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the states that have taken such initiatives.
The funny thing is that the sale of GNFC has increased by 27 over the previous year.
Brothers and sisters, Our economy has an important role in our daily life.
Most of these people are paid money, money for work or paid cash, and we know that the workers are also deprived.
In addition to 100 rupees, 80 rupees are paid, 50 rupees are paid and these workers are deprived of many other benefits including health insurance.
But when cashless payments are made, the money gets straight into the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should come forward in these areas.
Our youth have improved a lot through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity, our younger generations should take new ideas, with new technologies, with new technologies.
We have to join the country with full strength in the campaign to free the country from black money and economic corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people before every Mann Ki Baat programme, you have sent your suggestions and your opinions and this time thousands of opinions have been suggested in MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The writers of the second group, who have laid emphasis on this, have done so much good work, work for the country's good, such a sacred thing, but they have explained how new methods are being adopted against it.
Mr. Gurumani Keobal wrote in MyGov: This step is commendable for taking black money.
Our problems as citizens are right, but we are collaborating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in the war against corruption, black money etc.
This is the same idea from all parts of the country that Guru Mani has just written.
We all feel it.
In fact, these are the fulfilment of change of agent of change.
I would like to thank you all for one more reason, they have not only suffered the difficulties but also gave a strong answer to those who are trying to mislead the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened their skulls with their intellect, energy and creativity and have brought the truth forward.
I salute this strength of the people.
People are the blessings of God, the blessings of the people.
I thank the people of the country for taking part in this great enthusiasm against corruption and black money.
I wanted that there should be detailed discussions on political parties and political funding as the fight against corruption and black money is going on.
Those who are rolling out a lot of political parties are wrong to rotate.
This government is a government of public welfare.
On the other hand, I said on the first day-8, this is a wonderful fight.
The information that is coming from the government system is coming from the common people.
The success that we have achieved is mainly due to public awareness.
Can anybody imagine how much risk are the aware citizens of our country to open their mouths
If you get help, this fight will be very easy.
There's one third of those who send me letters, who're too many.
They say that Modiji doesn't stop, don't get tired, take as hard as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of tiredness.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very hard.
The law will play his role in the coming days.
It is our first duty that is worthless for the countrymen and the people.
In the last few years, India has established itself with pride in the global economy.
As per the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third place in the Top Prospective Host Economies 2016-18.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index-2016 has shown Indias progress in 19 phases.
Similarly, some other reports also indicate Indias rapid growth.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament has created an energy among the people of the country.
They have expressed their anger in various ways over the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their warmth in this regard.
But sometimes there's something good in these things, and the mind is filled with happiness.
There was a good work in the House of Parliament which did not come to the notice of the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am glad to say that a bill regarding the goals that the government is going on in front of the people with disabilities has been adopted in the Parliament.
Our government is responsible for the people with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have strengthened this effort when Para Olympics won four medals.
This win has not only increased the dignity of the country but its strength has surprised the people of the country.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, are an invaluable wealth and energy.
I am glad that the passage of this Act will provide more employment to the person with disabilities.
Reservation limit has been increased to four percent in government jobs.
The Act provides special provisions for education, convenience and complaints of disabilities.
The government has formulated this new law in line with the spirit of patriotism.
For the first time, a number of Divyangjans have been created so that they can get appropriate opportunities and justice.
Thalassemia, Perkinsons and Bamans have also been linked to this seminar.
My youngsters, in the last few weeks, there are reports from the field of sports that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket team won 4-0 in England.
The performance of some young players is very commendable.
The test was not only a great Kohli, but also a good leader.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
There's a good news in Hockey after 15 years.
I congratulate these youngsters for their success.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Party.
Last month, our women sportspersons have also achieved great success.
The Indian Women's Hockey team has won the Asian Employees and a few days ago, India's women's hockey team won the medal in 18 Asia Cups.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of Cricket and Hockey.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a year of new hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we all celebrated Deepawali.
Every year like this, during Deepawali, I went to China to make Diwali with the army.
I have celebrated Deepavali in the higher areas of the Himalayas with the youth of ITBP.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepavali is totally different.
They were full of emotions and I see a wonderful response to the congratulations sent by the people of the country, with their joy.
When I was watching these things, what's the best imagination, I am amazed.
But it's true that we don't think this time on the occasion of Deepavali.
On the contrary, it seems that with 125 crore Indians, I have joined the festival of Deepavali.
Dear countrymen, the intimacy, joy, love and joy that has been transmitted among the soldiers of our army, shouldn't it be bound in Holi Deepawali alone
I urge you to come, come, as a society, as a nation, as a part of the nature and nature, be it any festival or festival, we will remember the soldiers of our Army in some way during any joy.
When the nation becomes united with the army, the strength of the army will also increase by 125 crore.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
He had come here to attend the Panchayat Convention of Jammu and Kashmir.
Nearly 40-50 heads came from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
It's been a long-term conversation.
They came to know about some of the demands for the development and development of the villages, but the recent situation of the Kashmir Valley, law and order, the future of the children, had come up with these issues.
A few days ago, the board was examined in Kashmir and about 95 of the students were sitting in the examination.
I am sure that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to develop a bright future through education.
I thank not only their parents, parents, teachers and all the villagers for their commitments.
My dear brothers and sisters, When I have asked for a discussion on Mann Ki Baat this time, I acknowledge that everybody has made a proposal.
Everyone wanted me to tell you something in detail about a note of five hundred thousand rupees.
On 8th November, I had given a great mission to the nation for the right development of the country.
Whenever I took this decision and made that decision, it was clear that it was not a common decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of declaring the decision, I warn that the effect of this proposal is so broad that at least 50 days will be required to come out of it and then we will be able to move towards normal conditions.
It's not easy to recover from the diseases that have spread for seventy years.
125 crore Indians are confident that they are committed to the overall development of the country.
That is why we will succeed and whether the bank and post office workers are working in adversity.
And when humanity comes, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees were ears off, they immediately reached the house of a poor gentleman.
Not only that, he's arranged for treatment.
I am overwhelmed by this incident.
They're taking different ways to save their black money.
One request, don't play with the poor people to fulfil their injustice.
Your injustice is linked to the records of the poor, not after the investigation, these poor people will be relieved, they will suffer.
In order to undertake Benami Property, a very difficult norm has been made which is being implemented in all areas.
I am a common citizen of District Herda, Tahsil and village Tirali in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand notebooks are very commendable.
I urge you to take some initiatives through Mann Ki Baat where the common man has welcomed your efforts to improve the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you very much, you have said that everyday, but no one can think you can take such a big step.
By shutting down the notes of five hundred and thousands, you've taught the black guys suffering from corruption.
Every citizen of India has no longer a bigger day.
I once again thank you for this.
The Prime Minister said that when this kind of news is heard through media, common people and government sources, the enthusiasm to work increases.
People went there and ate it, and after two-four days, when they returned with the money, they finished the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where service supremacy and sacrifice are the main religions.
The news that I used to sit during the election spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world have also learnt the use of tea-speaking words.
But I didn't know that there might be a Cha-Batch in the future.
I got the news that one such marriage took place on November 17.
The wedding was organised only for the invitees, and there was no food and bread feeding programme, because they lacked cash during the closure of the note.
It is a matter of great gratitude for the people of the country to take part in the fight against corruption and black money in Surat and Bharat Maru and Skill tradition.
Whenever there is a crisis, people find new ways and once in a television, I see an incident in Dhekiyajuli village of Assam.
These tea workers are getting weekly wages from the village.
The neighbours bought four women together and paid two thousand rupees.
You know very well that even if the poor people were two days ago, they would gather at least.
Every Municipality tax is only fifty percent.
But after the announcement of the eight-day announcement, people's old note falls into the heroic of Jamdeva.
You will be surprised to know that during the last year, there was a collection of Rs. 3,500 crore in the form of tax.
We are getting such a variety of benefits that we are looking at.
Brothers and sisters, Village and Farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to especially congratulate the farmers of the country whenever we are adjusting every citizen, due to this change in the economy.
I was counting this year's seeds.
I am glad to see that pomegranates, pulses or oilseeds have increased the risk of paying this year as compared to last year.
In all the opponents, the peasants have taken new paths.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, where the tribals and villages are being given priority.
Our small businessmen also create employment opportunities and also participate in economic development.
For them, I had taken an important decision in the budget last year, so that small shopkeepers like big malls in the city will be able to do business for 24 hours and no law will stop them.
Adequate effort has been made to provide their loans through the Mudra Yojana.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to all these small businessmen through the Mudra Yojana, because innumerable people who are associated with this small business continue to carry out business transactions.
But this decision is natural for all these small businessmen to face difficulties.
You should also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Make arrangements for POS Machine for Credit Card and learn how to do business without any note.
You have seen that the big malls of technologies continue to do business.
Likewise, a small businessman can also make business transactions with the help of user friendly technology.
There's no possibility of any accident. There's a chance to extend.
I urge you to join in creating a cashless society.
You can take full banking facility on mobile phones for enhancing business and keep the business without cash note transactions.
These are technological methods that are safe, safe and fast.
I want you to not only help this campaign to succeed but also give your leadership and I believe you can lead this change.
I am confident that you will be able to fulfil all the business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to say to the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There's a wage written in the paper and what's being given in hand.
Sometimes it was found that there was a man standing outside, he had to be divided and the labour compulsory to consider this absorption as a part of life.
In the new system we want your accounts to be in the bank, your salary will be deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are paid.
You can get full money, nobody cuts.
Today, I want to talk especially to young friends.
We say that India is a country where 65 percent of the population is at the age of thirty-five years.
You, my country's youth and youngsters, I know my decisions have been disliked by you.
I also know that you have supported this decision.
I am also aware that you will also have a lot of contributions in taking this thing forward.
But guys, you're my real soldier, real friend.
My brave boys, can you help me
Just stay with me, don't work at all.
You have the idea of the world today, it's not an old generation.
It may be that the elder brothers in your family don't know so much that Aarma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, mother-in-law may not even know so much.
You know how App Kisnis, online banking, online ticket booking is done.
It's a common thing for you and you use it.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do is our dream is 'Kashles Society'.
It's right that a hundred percent of the casualties society is not possible.
But once we are able to pursue the Less-Kash Society, the goal of Cassless Society will not be incomplete.
And I am aware that you will never disappoint me because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of India.
You know, how many opportunities are there for Cassless Society, for digital banking or mobile banking.
Every bank provides online comfort.
Every bank in India has its own mobile app.
There's every banking wallet.
The whiteness of the wallet means E-Manibag.
There's a lot of cards.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have a y card that was used very little.
Since eight days, the poor people have been using their varieties and it has increased by about three hundred.
As pre-paid cards are available on mobile phones, cards are available for bankruptcy costs.
And this work is as simple as your What's Appearance.
The phones that are available with simple features can also be captured.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, newspapers, tea, pearl sellers, everyone can use it in a way.
And I have also tried to simplify this system.
All the banks are working together.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a generation who are unaware of these things.
And yourself, I know very well, you're active in this great work.
The kind of creative messages that you have given on the WhatsApp, I see everything, poetry, poetry, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter, and the creative strength of the younger generation in the face of challenges, it seems that the specialty of this India is that in some era of war, Gita was born.
Similarly, today, when we are going through such a big change, the fundamental creativity of yours is emerging.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I and I believe that you will do this thing for millions and millions of youth of the country.
Do one thing, from now on, promise that you will be a part of the 'Kashles Society' itself.
Use the technology of online manufacturing on your mobile phone.
Not only this, every half an hour, one hour, two hours and at least ten families will explain how to use this technology, how to download their bank apps, how to spend the money in their accounts and how to provide it to Dodokander.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You willingly enter this Cassless Society, by extracting the society from the cycle of this not. You will have to give the leadership of the great campaign, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from corruption and problems.
I invite you- Come, not just support, we are soldiers of this change and change.
We will take this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where the younger generation has changed the lifestyle of that country and it will be believed that the changes that bring about, the youth and the youth revolution.
M-PESA has set up a mobile system, has used technology, M-PESA and today Africa has taken the responsibility of changing the entire business in Kenya in this area.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, once again, I am keen to tell you that you should take this campaign forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NCC, NSS to work in a collective and personal manner.
You have seen that Amitabhav ji, the most popular writer of this time, is taking the Swachhta mission forward with a lot of hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through the Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts and your ideas are reaching the Narendra Modi App in MyGov and keeping me connected with you.
Now the Mann Ki Baat is being published at the time of 11:00, but only after the completion of this broadcast, it is going to be heard in the regional language.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiative that they have taken so that the people of the country will also get the opportunity to join the Hindi language.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, I don't wish you all a lot of Diwali.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is such a country where festivals are seen in some part of the country for 365 days.
With the end of many traditional festivals, we have easily adopted several changes in the festival according to the time and the interest of the society.
But now we are able to see this thing well that the entire journey of the festival in India, its depth, its depth and its impact on every person - all these things are linked to the same original mantra - to the group.
Increasing individuals and individuals, an endeavour continues to expand their limited thoughts from Periyasmaz to 1990.
And it's possible through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival of food festivals in India, but there is a feeling of thinking about what season and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are the farmers and how to connect the crops with the festival, what kind of reforms should be made in the field of disease free, all the thoughts of our ancestors have been associated with the festival in a scientific manner.
Today, the whole world is thinking about the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festivals strengthens nature and makes everybody more greetings from child to child.
And science has proved that what kind of change comes in the water of the ocean in the full moon and the moon, which affects the nature and affects the minds of the people.
So far, our vacations have become a tradition of composing sciences.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is educational, it brings the feeling of education.
The festival of Deepawali indicates that Tamsoma is a light from darkness.
The festival of social oppression is Deepawali to liberate the lamp from the shadow of personal oppression, to reach light from darkness.
One thing we all know is that every household of the country is going through any corner of India, at the time of Dhani-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari-Dhari.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of the world, the Parliament, the rulers and all of them become part of the Deepavali festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the pictures of the festival of Deepawali with great pride all over the world.
16 women members of Singapore Parliament, after the Indian saris, stood outside the Parliament and spread the pictures on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepavali is celebrated on every road in Singapore.
I mean to say that the festival of Deepawali inspires everyone from darkness to light.
During Deepavali, the news of accidents, fire brigades, immortality, is very worried.
And there is a problem that during Deepawali, many doctors went to Bari to celebrate Deepawali with all the families on Deepawali.
It is not empty one day, but govardhan Puja, Brotherhood, Benefit Panchami to Kartik Purnima for a long time.
This is a festival, which lasts for four days.
But there is a specialty that this festival gives a deep message to the society.
It is interesting that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the setting sun is worshipped.
There's a very big social message.
I talk about the festival of Deepawali. This is a matter of gratitude and appreciation for all of you, especially for the countrymen.
In the last few months, every soldiers of our armed forces sacrificed everything for our comfort.
In my mind, the sacrifice, meditation and labour of the soldiers of the Army-Security Force have made a special impact.
And that is why I think that this Deepawali is to be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the countrymen to participate in a campaign called Sandesh to Solidars.
But today I would like to say that there are no such people in India who do not have incredible love for the soldiers of the country, are not proud of the army and the defence forces.
The way people have published it will further strengthen the countrymen.
We can't imagine the soldiers of the defence forces, how much power you give to them.
Whether it is Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Navy, Personnel, Air Force or Coast Guard, I cannot tell you all.
When we are making Diwali, some are in the desert, some are protecting the summits of the Himalayas, some are protecting the airports, some are performing their obligations.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people.
The artist, whom he has communicated through the industry, has made pictures, alpnas, cartoons, whom Saraswati's gratitude is composed of poetry.
I can imagine how proud it is for my country's soldiers.
Sandesh to Solicitors, how many messages have come in this handloom.
Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has read a poem, I want to read it.
I observe the festival, compassionately, I tell you today that you're like this.
My dear countrymen, one sister, Shivani sent me a telephone message, whose father's house and mother-in-law-in-law worked in the army.
Come, listen to this soldier family, "Namskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am calling Shivani Mohan.
Our soldiers have been encouraged by the launch of the Sandesh to Solutions campaign in this Deepawali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and mother-in-law were the army officer.
This Sandesh has inspired all the army officers on the border and all the Army Circle.
I want to say that with the Army officers and soldiers, their wife and the entire family have to give up a lot.
My dear countrymen, it is true that not only the soldiers crossing the border but also their awareness in various fields of life.
Our brave soldiers are encouraging the patriotism in all walks of life, and in my view, a thing that I want to tell you.
This discussion indicates that some families are unable to build a household toilet due to lack of money.
Vikas Tagore has shown that 57 households have empowered the Swachhta Abhiyan by paying one thousand rupees from their pocket.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an Open Defecation Free State.
Nobody's easier there.
These youngsters took bricks, cements and other toilets on their shoulders and reached the forest all day long.
More than one and a half municipalities and corporations have been declared open defecation free in Gujarat.
Ten districts are also in this list.
My dear countrymen, the government has made a lot of plans and if there is a better plan after the first plan then the first one has to be removed.
But usually nobody looks at this.
There is no need for kerosene in the households that have gas connections in our country.
But who's looking for someone in the government
I heard that seven or eight districts have been freed from kerosene.
I think the entire state will be very quickly free of kerosene.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
What will the country do, how to do, all his ideals are still considered to be a testimony.
Whenever you plan, you will remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then you will think that what you are doing will benefit these people or not.
We have to take one step after another to get rid of the problem.
Whatever our old beliefs, the difference between boys and girls in society has to be overcome.
This is an example of the distinction between our daughters in Indian society.
The vaccination is done by the government, but even then lakhs of children get out of the vaccination programme and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is an expedition involving children who are left out, which empowers children to get rid of fatal diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
In order to liberate the villages from the blindness, the mission to deliver electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
I'm gonna have to work before the deadline.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore households from smoke and this campaign is also going on successfully.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk sellers, breeders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders, lenders and lenders.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, all these are a successful campaign to get rid of the beneficiaries.
The Aadhar Card is being directly accessed to the bank and direct financial benefits are being provided to the real buyers.
It's time to get rid of the lives of the common man.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, this country's glorious Indian unity was shown by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
On 31st October, on the one hand, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the leading dignitaries of the country's unity, and the auspicious date of Smt.
You know on October 31, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Sardar Patel is a person who has given his lifelong integrity and I think he has succeeded in this direction.
He has collected all of them, and we can say the fate of the country, or say that Gandhi was killed in those days.
And we all know what happened to the country after his murder.
Your Majesty, I want to say how can we shut down the consequences of such unfortunate events.
My dear countrymen, this sadness is not one.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, is a testimony to the integration of the history and the great task of uniting the country after Chanakya has been done by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
But it is also a sad thing that Sardar Saheb had sacrificed his lives for unity, fought and had been the main objective of unity of the country, so many had become a victim of dissatisfaction but he never left the unity.
But on the birth anniversary of that Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars have been put on the path of death after the assassination of Smt.
All the great men who spent their lives for unity, their birth anniversary, the atrocities of the Sardars on the day of their birth, this page of history gives us all trouble.
But even in this crisis, the mantra of unity must be taken forward.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, nutritives, food habits, but unity among these diversities is the strength of India, the specialty of India.
Every generation has the responsibility, every government has the responsibility to develop unity in every corner of the country and to develop the policy of unity of the country.
We should protect ourselves and our country from the tendencies of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us 'One India' and we all have the responsibility of creating a Best India.
The Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.
Sometimes we have heard the name of 'Amul'.
Today, people from all over India and India are also aware of each of the commodities of Mussoorie.
But few people knew that the visionary Sardar Saheb had imagined the creation of a co-operative manufacturer.
In 1942, Sardar Saheb was a living example of how Sardar Saheb had done it for the prosperity and prosperity of the farmers today.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, wherever we stay, I will remember Sardar Saheb, I will take a resolution of unity.
My dear countrymen, after this Deepavali, Kartik Purnima is also a part of the light festival.
Guru Nanak's teachings show the right direction for the entire humanity, for India and for the entire humanity.
Be it service, truth and everybody, this is the message of Guru Nanak.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his original mantra.
The campaign to liberate society from discrimination, blind faith and illiteracy was in every word of Guru Nanak.
I also salute Guru Nanak from the bottom of the heart on the occasion.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Deepavali dedicated to the soldiers of the country, on the occasion of this Deepavali, I am extremely grateful to you.
Your dream, your commitment is successful in all ways.
May your life be filled with comfort and peace, I extend my best wishes to all.
My dear countrymen, salute all of you.
A few days ago, we have lost eighteen brave children in the country in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute these brave soldiers and pay my respects.
And so I'm gonna tell my countrymen that day I said I'm gonna repeat the same thing that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, our forces are trusted.
We are proud of our armies.
I would like to talk to the people of Kashmir in a special way today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the forces of the country.
And those who understand the truth, Amani has separated himself from that power and started walking on the path of peace.
Every mother-in-law is faster and faster, all schools and colleges.
The farmers also want their fruits to reach all the markets of the country.
And, in the last few days, business has also started moving.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are also the path of solutions to all our problems, our progress is also the path of progress and our development.
We have to cross new heights of development for the future generations.
I believe that we will find solutions and solutions to all the problems sitting together and will also create a better way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Safety of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this administration.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to take some arrangements.
I would like to tell the lawmakers that we have the strength, the power, the law, the rules and regulations, to maintain the law and order, to give life of peace and prosperity to the people of Kashmir.
Sometimes people of different opinions from what we think.
Nowadays I have a chance to know a lot in social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to understand the feelings of every kind of people, and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, an eleven-class student, sent me a different kind of feeling.
He wrote, "I am amazed after the invasion of Uri.
I had a question about what I could do for the countrymen.
I'm sure I'll read three hours every day.
I will be the eligible citizen of the country.
"Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of anger and at such a young age, this is my pleasure.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to reach this spirit of the country to the world.
And he inspired the common man through the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jaikishan, and showed how to work for the country.
Red Bahadur Shastri ji had shown that there is another romantic exhibition in the voices of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the movement, whenever the movement was needed at a rapid pace, he used the rapidity of the movement to organize the construction work within the society in a very successful manner.
We all should take responsibility for the army, the people living in governance should take their duties and the people of the country should contribute to some or the other creative work on the environment of the country.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik wrote to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who had gone to Para Olympics have created history and their victory is the victory of Human Spirit.
You are not only the two but also the emotional attachment of every individual of the country towards the athletes participating in Para Olympics.
Perhaps Para-Olympics and the exhibition of our sportspersons, from the perspective of humanity, our perspective towards the Disabilities have completely changed.
And I'll never forget this thing of our winner Deepa owner.
When he got the medal, he said, I have lost the disability through this medal.
There is a lot of strength in this matter.
This time, three women from our country, including nineteen athletes, participated in the Para Olympics.
If we compare the game with the other games, the physical capabilities, the talent of the games, the power of will and determination is the greatest thing.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won four medals, including two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal.
The gold medal winner Devendra Jhazaria brought the gold medal for the second time after twelve years.
It's too old for twelve years, and once you get a gold, it's hungry.
But Devender showed that the condition of the body, the old age, never let his commitment be shorter, and he won the gold again after twelve years.
He wasn't disabled from birth.
Because of electric doubts, one of his hands is removed.
You must think that the person who won the first gold in the age of thirteen years and second gold in the age of thirty-five years has done a great job in his life.
Mariyappan won gold medals at Thangavelu High Jump.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't hinder his commitment.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't even come from a clean family.
In the life of 21st year, he fought with all the hardships, despite the physical complications, he gave medals to the country in the strength of commitment.
Athlete is connected to the owner's name.
Varun C.
He won brass medals at Voti Haizamp.
In our country, in our society and around us, these medals have done a bigger role in our transformation towards our disabled brothers and sisters.
Very few people are wondering how the people with disabilities have shown in this Para Olympics.
A few days ago, the Olympic competition was held at the same place.
Moreover, I was surprised when I knew that the fourth among those people who had not received any medal was running shorter than the gold medals of the common man, I once again congratulate all our players.
In the coming days, India is going to make a smooth plan for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, how surprising I have experienced in New Year last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Campaign for Divyangjans and many World Records Campaigns were held on that day.
There's a little girl with me from Gaurishadul, who doesn't see, came from the far-flung forest of Dang district.
The Government of India has set up a world record on the soil of Nubsari, which is very important.
Out of eight hours, six hundred Divyangs, who could not hear, were able to provide machines for them.
The incident took place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to set up three World Records by Disabilities one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness must be our nature and every citizen should have the duty to create an environment of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when two years are being completed, I can say with belief that awareness has increased in the hearts of 125 crore people.
I had said that one step ahead towards cleanliness and today we can say that every step has been made to move forward.
That is, the country has moved towards cleanliness of 125 crore.
That is why everybody can contribute to the cleanliness of the people, the rulers, the government departments or the roadsides, the bus stands or railway stations, the school-colleges, the hospitals, the poorest of the villages, the poor and the poor.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we have to move a long way.
To be healthy, for the honour of citizens, especially for the honour of mothers and sisters, the habit of open defecation has to be stopped.
And that is why a campaign of Open Defence Free (ODF) i. e.
I went to Gujarat recently, where the officers told me that the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi will reach Porbandar on October 2 this year.
Congratulations to those who have succeeded in this endeavour, not to those who are trying to achieve success.
My request to the countrymen - for the honour of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, this problem will free our country from the problem.
Come on, let's move forward with our commitment.
I would like to launch a new project for young friends who are now technologically used, especially for them.
The government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this number of 1969, you will not only be able to know the data of the construction of your city's toilets but also ask you to make a new toilet.
You, especially the youth.
The Government of India is also calling upon the corporate world to come forward and call upon such professional youth to sponsor for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Yojana.
And that is why we have to move towards the Wasteo Compost along with the Swachhta Mission.
The chemical sermons have been told to buy the compounds that have been created from Waste.
The farmers who are going to organic farming, give them the need for enjoyment.
Those who have improved the health of their land, those who have lost their lives due to the use of chemical fertilizers, if they need some such fertilizer then supply them.
Mr. Amitawah Bachan has joined the Brand Ambassador for this work.
I am supposed to have a new news about cleanliness.
Once, I have papered the news - students of Gujarat Technology University have gone to 107 villages and have launched an awareness campaign to build toilets.
The Government of India has also created a calendar of one year in its respective sectors.
Each department is focusing on cleanliness in 15 days.
I would like to urge the common citizens, if you are associated with the work done by these government departments, then you are also involved in this campaign.
This time about five hundred cities of one lakh population have gone.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we will do a good thing next time.
There is an environment of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all citizens will be able to join this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Two years of Swachh Bharat Mission are being completed.
I urge you to buy something prepared from Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali.
This time, I would urge every family to buy something from Khadi, so that the lamps of Deepavali are brightened in the houses of the poor.
On 2nd October, however, on Sunday, but as a citizen, can we take part in the Swachhta Abhiyan somewhere
You must work hard for at least two-four hours in the work of cleanliness and share a photograph on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, you can share it.
Our collaborative efforts will strengthen this mission, new pace.
Come, let us recall Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and resolve to do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating a recognised aspect of life, a wonderful pleasure.
In the last few days, I have also seen that when I had requested to quit the virtue on gas, the way the common man has stepped up is an inspirational event in our national life.
Some of our youngsters, small organisations, people from corporate world, students from school and some voluntary organisations will celebrate Joy of Giving Week from 2nd October to 8th October in many cities.
The objective of the campaign is to reach out to the people who are deprived of food items, dress and dress.
When I was in Gujarat, I have seen that our officers went near different families and collected the old toys in their houses and gave the children of all the organs in the poor settlements.
It's really good to see those poor kids getting these toys.
I believe that in the cities where the Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated, the enthusiastic youth will have to give inspiration and help.
This festival is a festive festival.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, on 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya's birth anniversary and his birth anniversary is being celebrated from today.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
Working in all hands and water in all the lands, both of these words demonstrated his economic thoughts.
Her birth centenary year will be celebrated in the form of a poor welfare year.
The society, the government and all others have to be careful about how the results of development will be achieved. Only then will we get rid of poverty.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, I started the Mann Ki Baat celebrations on Vijaya Dashmi.
The common man of the country is associated with me, which has always been published in Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way you have encouraged and blessed and blessed the celebrations of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to the aspirations that they have not only published the programme but have also made every effort to reach the audience in all languages.
I am also grateful to all those people who have written a letter in the Mann Ki Baat programme, suggested, published the fault of the government system, organised special events on all these papers and created a platform to solve the problems of the government employees.
Because of this, Mann Ki Baat has become a new medium of social change not only for a few and a half minutes.
What else can be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
Therefore, I thank all those associated with this institution for making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, Deepawali is being started in the next week.
New night or Durga Puja- This worship of strength must be worshipped by the unity of society.
There will be festivals to connect with each other.
That will be the means of real energy and then we will be able to celebrate the Vijay Festival together.
Come, worship the energy, move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, on August 29, the birth anniversary of Hockey's magicians.
This day is celebrated in the National Sports Day celebrations across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also recall his contribution to you all.
He played an important role in winning Gold in the Olympic Hockey in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We're all cricket lovers, we know the name of Broadman.
He had talked about meditation, He scores goals like runs.
Dhyanchand ji was a sportsperson and a living mosquito of the country.
Once at a match in Kolkata, the player of the opposite party hit the head with hockey sticks.
The match is over and only 10 minutes left.
Dhyanchand ji made three rounds in that 10 minutes and said, I replaced the injury.
My dear countrymen, whenever Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions on MyGov Portal or Narendra Modi App.
Shriman Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell us about their participation in the Mann Ki Baat-Mays education and sports because they have won the medals in the Reoplympics and honoured the country.
Shriman Sachin has written to you that this time you will definitely inscribe the Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Yojana on Mann Ki Baat.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from East India, and another from India.
It seems that the women from all over the country have taken the burden of brightening the name of India.
She wrote on MyGov Portal that we could have made better results in Olympics.
He says, Honourable Modi sir, first of all I thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But I want to attract your attention in this regard. What was the meaning of participating in our unprecedented competition
The answer is: No.
And nobody else can do better than you.
Similarly, Shri Mansitya Prakash Mehra wrote in the Narendra Modi App that in Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on additional educational programmes, particularly children and youngsters.
Thousands of people have expressed the same feeling.
It's not a way to discriminators that we haven't been able to show the hopeful results.
In some cases, it has also been said that our sportspersons have reached home, they cannot reach the level of sportspersons.
And we're just two medals in the rank.
But it is also true that even if we are not able to get the risk, then we will see that in many cases, the Indian players have shown extremely transparency for the first time.
Look, we have won the fourth place in the shooting and the medal for a very little bit.
Deepa Yojana in Gymnastics has also shown a very good sportsperson and empowered the fourth place and he won a very few medals.
But how would we forget that he was the first Indian woman in Gymnastics to eligible for Olympics and Olympics Festival.
Almost the same happened in Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana shoes.
This time we showed good results in the athletics.
After 32 years of humidity, Lalitababar won the talent of playing in the Track and Field Games.
Boxing-Ovikash Krishna Yadab reached the uarter Film but couldn't win the medal.
There are many players like Aditya Ashok, Dadu Bhoknal, Atanu Das and others who have shown great sports.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we're doing now, we might be silent again.
I've announced the formation of a committee.
We will deeply review the way the world is conducting sports.
We'll make a roadmap of how we can do better.
We have planned the results by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would also urge the State Governments to make such a committee and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also like to urge sports-related institutions to do brainstorming in a self-sustainable manner.
The State Governments should review and send their suggestions.
And I believe that we are 125 crore Indians and 65 percent of our youth will have to achieve the best results in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, Teachers' Day.
I spent some time with the students on Teachers Day for a few years and spent the same time as a student.
I've learned a lot from these little boys.
I have the same day as the Teacher's Day on 5th September.
But now I have to go to the G20 Summit, so I want to express this feeling of my mind in Mann Ki Baat today.
The place of mother in life, the place of teacher.
These days, after the Reo Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichas is being discussed.
He's a sportsperson right, but he's got the best testimony.
I see Gopichand as an excellent trainer than a player today.
And on Teachers Day, I respect Pullela Gopichand, his meditation, his contribution to play and his disciplinary success in his own way.
We always feel the role of teachers in all of us.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering on 5th September, 2018.
On the birth anniversary of all-party Radhakrishnan ji, the country celebrates this day as a Teacher Day.
Wherever he couldn't reach, he always tried to spend his day as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say, "Good teachers are the ones within whom students never lose.
Even after being President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has shown a wonderful life to be a teacher, to keep his students alive.
I sometimes think I remember a lot of my teachers because he was our ideal in our small village.
Today, I am happy to say that a teacher who is often nineteen years old is still writing in his own hands every month.
If you have to fight with your teachers, if there is a good incident with your teachers, if you have any message sent to your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, the exchange of teachers in the country is very valuable from the perspective of the students.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, the Ganesh Festival will be celebrated.
Lord Ganesha removes all the obstacles and we all want our country, society, family, all persons and their lives to be uninterrupted.
Whenever we talk about Ganesh Festival, it is very interesting to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh Festival a public form.
Through the Sarvajan Ganesh Festival, he made this religious festival a festival of national awareness, a festival of social reforms.
Everything that affects the society through the Ganesh Festival should be discussed in order to make the society new and new.
However, the mantra that Lokmanya Tilak had envisaged - Swaraj is our birthright - it is the centre of all the discussions.
Nowadays Ganesh Festival is celebrated not only in Maharashtra but all over the country.
In particular, youngsters have started preparations to celebrate this festival with enthusiasm.
Some people are still trying to follow the ideas that Lokmanya Tilak had started this festival.
Discussions, creation competitions, short-term competitions are organized on various issues.
All those things that affect our society are beautifully depicted in the graveyard of the statue.
The public Ganesh Festival was organised by a massive public education campaign.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra of our birth rights.
But now we live in free India.
We will now say on this public Ganesh Festival, Suraj is our right.
We will go through the Suraj, the Suraj will be our original demand.
Can't we move forward with this mantra
Come on, I'm calling you.
Our life is impossible without the festival, but according to the time, it has to change.
This time many people have written a lot about Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
They're particularly worried about the environment.
An individual named Shankar Narayan Pacific told me, "Modi ji, what do you know through the Bath programme that they use the statue of Ganesh built by the Plaster of Paris, without using the statue of Ganesh built by the puppet of the village"
The conservation of the environment, the protection of rivers and vegetation and the protection of the smaller organisms living in the water from pollution is a transformation of the service of God.
Lord Ganesh - Vignahari.
That's why we don't create such statues.
I don't know how you're gonna take these things to me, but I'm not just talking alone, many more are saying.
Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival - this is also a social service.
Durga Puja is still left for some time.
Now we have to ensure that those old families who used to build statues, if they make statues of the flower or the mud brought from the river then they will get the opportunity to produce.
And after the festival, they will be dedicated again and save the environment.
I convey my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chatti.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be dedicated to Sant on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had lived her lifetime in the service of the poor people of India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of this Madar Teresa Saint.
A delegation from our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of a hundred and fifty-five Indians and the Government of India to participate in the 4th September event.
We can always learn from the saints, sages, sages and princes.
I hope we'll do something new, learn and do something good.
John Shakti is considered as a God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the five State Governments in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan for Swachh Ganga.
The Prime Ministers of the villages present in Allahabad have sworn in as a witness to the mother Ganga and they will stop the habit of open defecation in the villages themselves.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of five States who have taken an important step in connecting the people with the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
The seventeen to seventeen-year-old girls have worked.
This letter has an emotional effect that whenever the students came to school the next day they had written a letter to the teachers of the school, they would make the toilets in the house within a specific time.
A sixteen-year-old girl is sitting in Satyagraha against her family in Koppal district of Karnataka.
Whenever the village chief Mohammad Shafi can embrace that Mallamma is satisfying for toilets, he made a toilet in a week by paying Rs. 18,000.
The village heads like Jewels and Mohammad Shafi, like Mallamma, are indeed important.
The way to solve the problem, it's the people's strength.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge to someone.
And some Indians have chosen this as their goal.
The Government of India is contemplating to make a film with Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this short film to the Government of India.
Details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and the winner will be awarded on 2nd October on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti.
I'm also telling TV channels that you're doing such a film.
My dear countrymen, India is always trying to deepen our relationship with our neighbours, be it easier and alive.
A few days ago, an important incident took place, our President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, greeted the Akashbani Maithi channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe many people will think that the President will launch a radio channel
But it's not a simple radio channel, it's a very big step.
We're in Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still taking forward the same cultural tradition.
Therefore, on the one hand Akashwani Maitri and on the other hand Akashwani Betara will exchange various events and people from both sides of Bengal will enjoy astronomy.
Akashwani has contributed a major role in human connectivity.
The President inaugurated it.
I would like to thank Bangladesh who have been associated with it.
I convey my best wishes to the friends of Akashwani and they are also playing their role in foreign policy.
Such incidents give new energy, inspire, and this is the source of inspiration for the people of the country.
A few days ago, I got a letter that shook my mind.
Almost a mom, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
If not, he never refused to publish his name in the letter, I'd like to tell all of you Ornam.
In the letter, he wrote, When you requested to disperse the gas, I left the gas allowance and then I forgot it.
My dear countrymen, you know, I tried to send a letter to those who left the gas bill, and some of my delegates were present on their own.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
The blessings of the millions of mothers and sisters like him and his mothers are helpful in creating the future of our country, empowering and relieving.
My dear countrymen, we were very worried about the end of last year, but in the month of August, we have been suffering from continuous floods.
There have been floods in some places of the country.
State Governments, Central Governments, local administrative institutions, social institutions and citizens have made it possible.
But there's some news in the floods that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by pushing these small boys, they must have to responsibilities to these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, this country is great and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that in the coming days, there will be an atmosphere of enthusiasm for every young man to spread across the country.
We all are going to organise the largest sports Mahakumbh in the world in a few days.
Rio will be repeated in our ears.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a massive and beautiful race called Run for Rio, Khelo and Save, Khelo and Prospected Ho.
Wherever I live in the coming days, I will do something to encourage our players.
I will be with you to enhance the enthusiasm of all our people as a citizen like 125 crore Indians.
Come, let us all honour each player in the coming days, and reward them as much as possible.
Today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem composed by Surajprakash Upadhyaya, a poem composer of Panjab Central University.
Perhaps there are many more poets who write many poems, perhaps somebody writes poems and somebody will do it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poem that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, reminded me of the birth anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
Last week, on the death anniversary of Adul Kalam ji, the country and the world have paid homage.
Whenever Abdelkalam ji was named, the pictures of science, technology and satellites of a powerful India of the future are in front of us.
And that's why it is written that what is your government doing for the supporters of Abdul Kalam ji's dream
If we drag the old technologies out of research and discovery, we will continue to be out of the changing age of the world.
And that is why the government has taken several initiatives for the development of technology, research and research.
So I say, Let us innovate is aimed at further research.
And when I call 'Let us aim to innovate' then AIM means Atal I
If we have to make our next generation entrepreneurs, we have to connect with this work.
And that is why the Government of India has taken initiatives to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we want to have a strong and excellent laboratory, there is a framework for research, for innovation, to work, to reach him to a certain goal.
As a new research house is required, it is also necessary to make the old research house better.
The technological solutions have to be found in everyday life.
We have called upon the youth of today to look at Atal Grand Challenges, if there is a problem in your eyes, find out the technology, research, find out and tell us.
If the Government of India is able to explore these new technologies to solve our problems, then it is encouraging innovators to be particularly rewarded.
I am glad that people are very interested in this matter.
When we talked about Tinkering Labs, more than thirteen thousand schools were asked and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand educational and other institutions were asked.
The state government and the central government are working shoulder to shoulder with the help of the affected people.
Even though there are some problems for rains, the minds of everybody in the year are filled by rains and cultivation, because we are at the centre of the entire financial pictures.
Sometimes there are diseases that we have to demonstrate our lives.
But if we're aware, be careful, we're trying to tackle diseases, then it's easier to save the throat.
Try to be careful about cleanliness, be careful, try to be safe.
Take special care of the kids and don't have a mistake that dengue is just a poor settlement, but it is not right.
Enjoying, the dengue first spreads to the rich.
You must have seen a television, yet sometimes we are eager to use it.
Dear countrymen, I want to attract your vision for another matter.
Life is so comfortable, there's a race in it, so it's never going to worry for yourself.
I'm sick, I think I'm sick, so I'm in any antibiotics.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating anti-biotics can lead to serious problems.
You might have relaxed for a while, but we should stop eating anti-biotics in consultation with doctors.
The bacteria that cause tuberculosis and malaria are transforming themselves at a rapid pace so that the efficiency of medicines is lost.
It is called anti-biotic registration.
Anti-biotic should be used as a regulation.
You must pay attention to it.
When there is a healthy talk, I want to join another thing.
Sometimes the lives of the pregnant mothers in our country are very worried.
Nearly three crore women are pregnant every year in our country, but some mothers die during delivery, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that in the last one decade, the maternal mortality rate has decreased, but still many pregnant mothers are not possible to save their lives.
During pregnancy, lack of blood, infections during delivery, high blood pressure, unknowing convulsions of different types will destroy his life.
In this context, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Abhiyan.
As per the programme, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost at Government Health Centres on 9th of every month.
It will be possible to save the lives of both mothers and children, and I would like to tell the physicians that you cannot treat the poor mothers free of cost on the day of the month, on 9th.
Is my doctor brothers and sisters unable to enjoy the poor for twelve days in a year
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is particularly worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
During the war of Kurukshetra, Lord Srikrishna spoke of trees in the battlefield and how important it is to think of trees in the field of war, we can imagine it.
In the Geetha, Lord Krishna says, 'Ashwath: Sarva Vrikshnang' means that I am universal among all trees.
There is no tree that has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates passes through the trees like that of the children.
That's why those parents who are talking about their welfare should plant a good tree and refresh like a child.
Whether it is our scriptures, Geethas, rituals, or Mahabharata's administrator festival, there are some of the present generations who have shown this philosophy of the scripture in their work.
A few days ago, I remember a daughter of Pune, Golden, who touched my heart.
The Mahabharata administered the philosophy of the Mahabharata that the trees also fulfil the duty of the child and the golden works to meet the needs of the society besides their parents.
The farmers of Narayanpur village of Pune-Junnar-Taluk of Maharashtra have married their grandson Gold in Maruti Mahatra.
Other temples can also start the tradition of planting trees instead of prasad in this year.
Currently, in order to build houses in India, crores of rupees have to be imported from abroad.
If we plant trees on the edge of our food, which will be used to build houses, then you can also sell them by taking government permission after 15-20 years.
This can be a new source of your income and will save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have taken several initiatives for the convenience of rainy season, the Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act, through this i. e.
Rajasthan has celebrated such a forest festival in a desert state and has taken a pledge to plant 15 lakh plants.
It's not a small thing that plants 15 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the soil of Rajasthan will know how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh aims to increase the greenery of the state by 50 by 2029.
Railways are greenery through the Green India Mission which is being launched by the Union Government.
There is also a bright sustainability of the forest festival in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has celebrated several projects called 'Amban, Ektaban, Shahid Van' as forest festivals and has launched crores of crores of rupees.
I can't mention all the kingdoms, but I am really commendable.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa a few days ago.
And whenever I travel abroad, we talk about code policy, commerce and commerce, security, sometimes mu are signed, all these things have to happen.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is considered, it is impossible to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandella.
Whenever there are words like arrogance, love, forgiveness, their faces emerge before our eyes.
I visited the Phoenix Settlement during my visit to South Africa, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to travel to that train from Petermarisburg station on which Mahatma Gandhi visited the train to convert Janik Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi, but this time I had the opportunity to meet the great people who had sacrificed their lives for equality and equality of everyone.
Even after doing so much penance, they didn't seem to have anything to do with their faces.
I would like to see the duties that have been spoken in Geetha.
That meeting will be remembered on my day.
It cannot be a big mantra for any society or any government to have equal and equal opportunities.
This is the path that takes us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, children want a better future - everybody needs different.
Priority can be different, but the path is one, and that path is development, equality, equal opportunities, equal thoughts and everybody's own thoughts.
Come, let us feel proud of those Indians who have lived in South Africa as well as the vision of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma, he gave me an incident.
Prime Minister, I am calling a artist from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I was in a record of newspapers that a gentleman had committed suicide by losing one and a half lakhs of rupees in an abusive manner.
I have a lot of condolences for my family as a woman.
I want to know what you are thinking about this inciting and loud e-mail.
"Some people lose their money.
This is a new way of survival through technology, which is spreading all over the world.
On the one hand, technology has played a big role in economic development, and people who use it have also come down to the ground.
You've ever forgotten, because they're so beautiful as if they're real.
Your credit cards, debit cards, and your bank accounts are empty through technology, by making a fake Letter Pad.
This is a new kind of cheating, digital cheating.
We have to stay away from this kind of mood, beware, and we have to share it with friends and friends of Message Alenizz.
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, show me, talk to me, they also spoke of their problems.
But recently I have a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh were with me.
He's drawing magnificent pictures at the station.
Not only this, we have built a virtual garden by planting the soil and planting the soil in finding out how much plastic bottles or oil cannons were found in the village.
In this way, they made the railway station completely new.
You must see the station when you go to Aligarh.
There's a sense of innovation.
This is the example of a change in the participation of the people.
Thanks to all those who are doing this kind of work in the country, especially to my colleagues from Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the climate of festivals starts in our country as soon as the rains come.
Festivals will be organised at different places in the coming days.
In the temple, the festival will be celebrated at the shrine and you will also be celebrated at home and outside.
Rakshabandhan is an important festival for us.
Have you not been able to confer the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or lifelong insurance scheme to the mothers and sisters of the country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan last year
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
On 8th August, the Bharatchado movement was launched, this year it is 75 years and it is going to be 70 years of independence on 15th August.
We are enjoying freedom and feeling proud of being an independent citizen. This is a matter of remembrance for those who brought freedom.
75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can inspire us, inspire us, and it is time to take a pledge to do good for the country.
I hope you will do something or the other inspiring self-reliance.
And nowadays technology has become so easier that whatever you can give to me, let me invite you and recall the lives of freedom fighters.
Everybody plans at the holidays.
And this holiday is my season, so I think I enjoy eating.
Sometimes I think it's very good if there's some time in the afternoon.
But this time the horrible heat surrounds all of you.
It's natural for the countrymen to be worried.
And there is a decrease in the storage of water conservation due to consistent completion.
This is the reason why people are very sensitive to water and some or the other thing about water conservation.
A few days ago, somebody was telling me that Hebrew Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers of that village have given great importance to the needs of water.
They have decided to leave the cultivation of all those crops in which water is required.
It's not as easy as it looks like.
Everyone has made a big pledge.
If a factory uses water and we talk of shutting down the factory, because if water is being used more then you know what will be the result.
It's true that I'm talking about a small village in Hebrew market, but there are many other villages like this.
I congratulate all these villagers for their good work.
The people have told me that the Gorba Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to make agricultural reservoirs in their efforts.
They made about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This led to an increase in ground water level, water rises very high.
I'm gonna say they're more than the railways.
The nature of the human beings is, however dangerous it is, if there's any harmony, it seems that the danger has been cut.
Since the possibility of 110 rains in place of 106, it seems as if there was a message of great peace.
It's too late for rains, but the news of good rains has created a new inspiration.
The farmers need the soil, the crops in the fields.
Can't we take the soil from the pond of the village and take it to the field
It will also improve the area and increase its water harvesting capacity.
Can the water be stored in the cement basket, sometimes in the empty basket of the serpent and on the way to the ground filled with water
The water level will grow, the water will come to our well.
So the water must be stored as far as possible.
The rain water will remain in the village and if we do something in this direction, it will be possible to integrate it.
So today the water congestion is good, it's going on, but we have time for the next month.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked in MyGov - Will Ganga Safai Mission be possible in our lives
How many governments have come and how many projects have been constructed.
And that is why it is natural to raise this question in the minds of millions of people of the country like brother Kumar Krishna.
The Ganga envisages our routine and the Ganga empowers us to save ourselves.
As the Ganges flows, the economy of the country also provides a new transit.
One Bhagirath brought us Ganga, but to save it, millions of Bhagiraths needed.
This will never be possible without the help of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several projects are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations together.
Several initiatives have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factory.
Every day, a large number of drains and drains come in the Ganges.
Trash skimmers keep cleaning the jewellery at various places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. for cleaning the jewellery.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularize the cleaning work.
Earlier, I was told that wherever efforts are done, every day 3 to 11 tons of jewellery is possible.
So it's right that we're able to clean a large number of jewellery.
There's a plan to install a trash skimmer at some other places in the coming days.
And its use will soon be understood by the people of the banks of Ganga and Yamuna, an effective plan has been prepared to control the pollution of pulp and papper, distillery and sugar industry.
The discharge of waste from Pulp and Paper Industries Bablack Leekur factory is almost completely closed.
These things prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also providing financial assistance to the cleanliness of the Ganga, which is doing well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated in India as the Panchayeti Raj Diwas.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system has started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system across the country is working successfully as an important unit of our democracy.
On 14th April, we have celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, and today on 24th April, I celebrate the Panchayeti Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful occasion, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He inspired this important task to connect the village with the Constitution.
The Bharatodaya Abhiyan was launched from Bapi Gramodaya on 24th April, 2014 for his birth anniversary.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, when Baba Saheb Ambedkar had his birth anniversary, I had the opportunity to salute him at the holy place.
Today, on 24th December, I will celebrate the Panchayeti Raj Diwas in Jharkhand, where the most tribal brothers and sisters are.
At three o'clock in the morning, I will talk to all the Panchayats in the country.
This campaign has worked as a funny awareness.
At the same time, in all the villages of India, these events have been going on for ten days, it is very rare.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Chiefs of the village.
You have used this opportunity to strengthen the development and prosperity of the village in a very basic and new manner.
And that's why we're all focusing on the village abdomen, so we'll get the fruits of Egypt.
Shermila, from Mumbai, has called her lips and spoken of her thinking.
-Pradhan Mantri Ji Namaskar
I'm talking to Sharmila from Mumbai.
You have questions about my school and school education.
For example, there is a need to amend the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if parents have the same dream in every family then it is the education of the child.
I'm gonna get back to the house.
This idea of teaching children in a country like India, the idea of teaching them a lot is a very big strength.
I want to further enhance this idea of better education to the child, and there is a need to be more awareness about this.
Therefore, I would urge all parents and parents to discuss the school programmes with children in a lot of time.
And if you feel something, go to school yourself and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing our educational levels.
And this will definitely be possible in all partnerships.
Every government in our country has given importance to education and they have tried their own way.
And it is also true that for a long time, we had a focus on building educational institutions, expanding education systems, building schools and colleges, recruitment of teachers, many children coming to school etc.
We have done a big job in promoting education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
This should be the main objective of a better education through a sensitivity campaign.
So far, infrastructure was required to be assessed.
Now it is necessary to calculate the success of education.
So far, how many students have come to school.
Enterprised, filled, filled this mantra forever.
But now the children who have come to school, we have to focus on providing better and eligible education.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on good education.
It's okay, there's a lot of ways left.
If we decide about 125 crore Indians, then we can also cross this path.
Shermila ji, however, is a matter of fact that we are desirable to bring about a change in our thinking.
You must have seen that this time some work has been done outside the traditional ideas in the budget.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten non-governmental universities were asked to be freed from government bonds and they were asked to know what is the challenge before them to become the best university.
Universities of India can compete with other universities of the world and also have to compete with this kind of competition.
It is also important to learn as well as skills.
This is why technology will play a big role in education.
Technologies of far-reaching will make our education easier.
And I believe I can understand the consequences of the far-reaching future.
Hon'ble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm calling Meena Karnwal from Visionor.
Youth play an important role in sports as well as writing today.
They need to have a concerted mindset of working and a good leadership so that they can develop.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters and I want the government to encourage the NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides as much as possible.
You have sent me so much suggestion that I would like to talk to NCC, NSS, India Scotts and Guides before talking to you.
I have repeatedly organised a meeting with the leaders of NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Youth Centre, in order to request you.
When I asked them when they met before, they told me that after the independence of the country, they were present in such a meeting for the first time.
This time I've put some such things before them.
I told them why our youngsters will not participate in water conservation during this summer
Something like this has happened to them.
I see it as a matter of conflict between us.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that there has been a lot of discussions in the last few elections - how many party will give gas cylinders
The economists also spoke of reducing gas subsidies.
Some committees have also proposed to reduce gas subsidy.
It's all the experience.
I said this, but today I want to say, I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore households have voluntarily left gas subsidy.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see that some of those who have left the subsidy are retiring teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers, such families of middle class or lower middle class.
However, it has been observed that more than 80 percent of those families who have left gas subsidy have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidies by writing on the line.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government leaves a little on tax, the government's appreciation on TV and newspapers will be heard throughout the week.
In our country, CBCD is considered to be a right.
But one crore families left the subsidies.
First of all, I salute one crore families because they have forced political leaders to think newly.
The economy of the world, whoever does this, demonstrates this kind of economic demographic dividend, is out of their minds.
Sometimes I think we declare that there will be no ticket examiner on this route today.
We can do a lot of such tests.
The hopeful results can be achieved if we believe in the people of the country.
Anyway, it's your own opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not being created by any political leader, so many families of the country have created this environment.
All breaking news is bad news.
Is there nothing good about us in this country of 125 crore people
Please change this situation.
He used to talk again and again.
A few days ago, on behalf of a newspaper, he wrote a letter to me that on Monday, they wouldn't print any ruthless news.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that if a well-known person speaks good words, chooses good words, exhibits it properly, the effects that can be seen more than that.
Good news inspires to do good.
It's okay, it's gonna reduce your place of badness.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be removed, it will happen
Perhaps you know that this is the reason why a website has been opened by the government - Transforming India - this website has been published.
This is not only the government but also the common man. You can also send good news to this portal.
You can also join it.
Raviji, you gave a good advice, but please don't be angry at me.
Together, we will try to work constructively, we will try to talk about constructive things, we will try to reach the structural goal.
The specialty of our country is Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be the centre of attraction for tourists.
Very few people in the world know that for such a long time, millions of people come to the bank of the river.
In a quiet mind, this fair takes place in a calm environment.
In an institutional perspective, the events indicate a very big significance in the perspective of common mans participation.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading pictures of lions.
I want the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government to organise a competition of these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a good photo.
He said that we have stressed on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only be stuck in this campus but also people from Kumbh will take a message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can also make it a social merger.
I can build a cultural field too.
Truth is, it can be an opportunity to reach the village.
My dear countrymen, on this great day of Panchayat Raj, I will surely meet you once again. I am grateful to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I have always waited for Mann Ki Baat and for you.
This time also I have seen that a large number of letters, comments, phone calls have come in which I have received many stories, suggestions and inspirations.
I think you're testing me.
Even so, I would like to share your words with you once again in the series of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had talked about a book of love lover stories and we decided that if someone reads a book then we will share some of the books with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen a large number of people shared information about different types of books.
I am glad that people have discussed many topics such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and life.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But one thing I have to acknowledge is that I can't read too much books now.
But I think we should take this experience forward for the last one month.
I want this book to become an active platform for corners, readers and writers.
Friends, I think that the Mann Ki Baat had touched this thing earlier, but today I am feeling that this water conservation was just like touching the hearts of the common man.
I am feeling that recently this water has attracted the hearts of your countrymen.
A lot of efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People are distributing information about different traditions.
A lot of innovations have been initiated on medical conservation.
This not only prevents the destruction of land and the destruction of crops but also provides water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful State of the North-East, the first State of the country, which has a water policy or water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs in this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of society come to the fair.
We will be able to conduct exhibitions here and play a very excellent role and the water conservation system will also be there.
This is the reason why I want to listen to you people today.
These are Nidhi Baipatu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdarkar, Ananth Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharv Deshmukh, Arnatesh Ganguly and Harik Alla-Manda.
Whatever I say about these will be proud of you and one of you will also be transmitted.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is afraid.
It looks like death is in the rocks.
But these ten children have not only defeated the fatal diseases like cancer in the war of life, but have brightened the name of India all over the world in their achievements.
In the field of sports, we often see that a sportsperson has won or won medals, but this is a rare experience where he has become a sportsperson before participating.
This month, the World Children's Winners Games was organized in Moscow.
The event is being organised in the field of shooting, playing, swimming, running, footwear and table tennising.
This ten volunteers of our country have won the medal in this field.
Some of them won medals in many games again.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you have been proud of the achievements of India in the far-flung space, Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
A number of people like Arvind Rao have written this in Narendra Modi App and MyGov from all over the country and expressed their interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, from the point of view of space research, the year 2019 is very good for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and then this Chandrayaan-2.
It is not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-Sat at that time.
The A-Sat missile was capable of hitting a satellite of 300 kms in just 3 minutes.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve success in this specific field.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has witnessed how Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota to the sky.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 has filled the countrymen with pride, energy and happiness.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special mission.
We should trust our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
It's Indian in life.
This is a complete indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-2 in a record time, the day-night and all the technological problems.
We have also faced the obstacles in this kind of temple satback economy in our lives.
But always remember that we have the ability to cross this hurdle.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan-2 movement will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the final truth that science is the path of development.
We are now awaiting the month of September when two landers will be transmitted to the moon land.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell the students of my country and my young friends about a thrilling competition and invite the youth of the country in a quiz competition.
Asked how to launch a rocket, how to send a satellite to the room or what we know from this satellite or satellite, A-Satki.
I would urge my young friends to take part in this quiz competition and remind them of it.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those winners, but for that you have to take part in this uiz Competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will have to keep in mind that our Mann Ki Baat has made the Swachhta Abhiyan at various times.
The efforts that are going on for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the journey that started five years ago has set new standards of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not been able to achieve ideal conditions in the field of cleanliness, but the way Swachhta Abhiyan has been successful in public places from the open space defecation campaign is the result of the will power of 130 crore Indians.
But we don't stop at all.
This movement has turned from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who has left Americas job to serve Bharat Mata.
A few days ago, he took the responsibility of making Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started beauty with his team from Lodhi Garden's storehouse.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are decorated with beautiful pictures.
When he made the overbridge and school walls beautiful, many more started coming forward and this way they started working.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I knew that Yogesh Saini and his team also played a very big role in this work.
There is no word in colour and line, but the impact of the Ramdhanu that emerges from them is more than thousands of words.
In the Swachhta Abhiyan, we continue to observe this beauty.
It is very important to make efforts to create wealth from waste to health in our lives.
I mean, we have to move towards making gold from the waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read an attractive comment on MyGov portal.
He was a resident of Sopian district of Jammu Kashmir, and a resident of Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat is very good to hear the event.
I am happy to note that I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I think this event should be organised every three months.
The event should also be organised online monitoring.
I think this is the first such event in which people could talk directly to the government.
Brothers and sisters, After reading the message that I have sent, I am keen to know about the BACK to Village scheme, so I read in detail about this and then I realized that it needs to be told to the entire country.
This scheme shows how much the people of Kashmir are interested in connecting with the root cause of development of the country.
They also knew whether the villagers are getting government services.
How can they increase their income
In order to make the programme more attractive, some more things were added.
The Sports Competition of Children was organised under Khelo India Scheme.
The event was distributed by sports equipment, Manrega project power cards and categories of Scheduled Tribes and Tribes.
Financial review camps were opened and stalls were provided by Government Departments such as agriculture and horticulture.
In this way, this event became a development festival.
It was also a festival of public participation, a festival of public awareness.
The common man of Kashmir was silent on the occasion of this development.
Any officer was so impressed by the warm greetings given by the villagers that they left in the village for two days.
It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for the participation of a large number of people in the rural areas and for their development.
This is a miraculous result of the new evolution and the new resolution.
Such programmes and human partnerships prove that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the strength of progress is ever more than the strength of the bombers.
Those who want to spread hatred on the path of development and stop progress, they will never succeed in their hatred.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra, who was honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, describing the form of a poem of Shravanmas in his poem, said, "Agyalganga in Madiga, Adrag Bhoomi Magna, that is, the bonds of rain and Baridhara are unbounded.
Whenever we look around in this season, it seems as if the brethren were singing green sheets.
This time, the festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated as Rakshabandhan.
You will be happy to know that this time, the maximum number of pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the pilgrims who participated in this 60-day journey in 2015, more than 28 days.
I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who have come back to the journey have brought the people of that state with a warm remembrance of their respect and hospitality.
This will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham in the last one and a half months since the start of the 4 Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year.
After a huge natural calamity in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims reached there for the first time.
I urge all of you, you must go to those areas where the beauty of the country is excellent in the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of our people, tourism and pilgrimage, it seems that no teacher can be a bigger teacher than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and live months of pride should transmit new energy, new hopes and new zeal among all of you.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we see TV, on one side rains, water thy, traffic jam.
You have to come out with the family to see the other pictures of the year where our farmers, birds and waterfalls flow and the sandals in the green sheet.
I wish that this rain brings together both freshness and happiness and freshness.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stay is a difficult task, but in the end a limit of time.
I'll come back a month after waiting.
I extend my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you're all busy examining.
Some guys may have passed the test.
And some people are getting twisted because on one side, the T-20 cricket World Cup.
Even today, you may be waiting for matches between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia, I extend my best wishes to both team players.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we are constantly getting the lowest place, we are losing, we're going back and following.
Now, in 1990, our place has descended so low that we can't dare to talk.
Over this year, we can create a footwear-footed environment.
In school, college, in every corner of the country, our youth, our school children sweat.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of them go somewhere in their own state for 5-7 days.
Some people go out of the kingdom.
I told you earlier that you should upload the phone from wherever you go.
We have to take this task forward.
You should do the same in the same way, but now write something with him - not just phones.
And it is said - A traveler with abservation is a bird with out wing.
If you want to see good things, you have to take care of it.
And I'm lucky, I've got a lot of chance to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a little older than you, I was roaming around a lot.
Perhaps there is no district in India where I had no chance to go.
Tourism has a big role to play in creating life.
And now the youngsters of India are going on tourism with courage and courage to tackle curiosity.
I believe it's a very good example.
Our younger generations should be brave to reach where no one has left their feet.
I would like to thank Kol India specially.
Then stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think what to get there.
And that's why people go away from the mines.
But that coal is built as a tourist destination
And I am happy that so far more than 10,000 people have seen the environment friendly mine tourism centers in Saun village near Nagpur.
This place itself gives a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on vacations, you can do some work on cleanliness.
Maybe there's no scientific work, but it's happening.
Cannot you also give importance to the cleanliness of the tourism center as a tourist
My firm belief, our young friends must help this thing.
Therefore, there is a lot of employment in tourism.
India is far behind tourism in comparison to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that we have to strengthen tourism, then we can definitely attract the world.
We can take a large part of the world tourism in this way.
And then it will be possible to make our country's millions of new youth jobs.
Whether it is government, organisations, society or citizens, all of them have to work together.
Come on, we do something for that.
My young friends, the vacations come and go, I don't like it.
You should also think about this.
Would you like to leave your vacations, important years of life, these important times like this
How many things I'm talking about, you can see.
Can't you take a pledge to add more quality to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know how to swim on holidays.
If you don't want to run a cycle, please learn to run a cycle during the holidays.
For the development of your personality during the holidays, do something to increase your capabilities, skills.
Not only the areas I have spoken, but there is a greater opportunity to work outside.
This will see your personality, your self-confidence, how much will increase.
Friends will talk about this.
There are some suggestions on MyGov portal for Mann Ki Baat.
Like: My name is Chaurvedi.
I am glad to have done this thing and I have become friends with many birds on this occasion.
I urge you to repeat this in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank this boy on the name of Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
He told me, he's been working all year and many birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Burma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds.
In his poem, he wrote, "Don't let you go away, get up, fill the pot, fill the pot with sweet cold water.
Come, let us make this thing useful for Mahadevi ji.
I congratulate him, and thank you, and you have reminded me of very important things.
Industries from Mahisur have made Kuke a very sensitive thing for all of us.
He said, 'Breastfeeding, newspapers, Postman comes near our house.
Sometimes the swords, the dresses sellers go on the way.
Have we ever called to drink their water during summer, have they ever given water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot of digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of young people in the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone, many information related to agriculture and climate will come to you.
What is the market situation, what is the situation of the pickery market, how good crops are being added at this time, what is suitable medicines etc.
And if you put a question before them, they'll answer him and tell you.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers before the start of farming.
Can't we find those old places again, clean it so that more water can be stored
This time you might have seen that efforts have been made to make 5 lakh ponds and land ponds.
Under the Manrega scheme, emphasis has been laid on creating resources through water conservation.
How to save water in the villages, how to save every drop of rain in the coming years, how to start this awareness campaign in the villages.
You should be involved in various government schemes that will create a mass movement for the importance of water and conservation.
There are many villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers and there are many aware citizens who are doing this work.
But we have to move ahead.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell you one more thing, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a big agricultural fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have come and how many changes have been made in agriculture.
But these technologies have to reach the field of farmers.
And now the farmers are saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I congratulate this way.
The most use of chemical serpent has made our earth sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantities, do you like to eat it
Whatever best sir, the use of these serpents can be a cause of loss.
Everything needs to be used.
This reduces the cost, saves the money.
I am hopeful that this work can be done with full focus on the necessary tasks for water conservation.
The amount of water that will save the farmers will benefit and lives will be the same.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
This year, the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that calls all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, many sick guests enter their homes, in the body.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 1. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of deaths are diabetes.
Diabetes is two types - Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary, parents, there is a chance of children.
And Type-2 is the reason for deafness, age and excessive weight.
The theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
There's a little hard work.
There's no name and sweat.
I'm not walking.
We're playing online.
Nothing happens in offline.
If you are interested in yoga, then practice yoga.
Otherwise, at least run away.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are near the hands, it becomes very easy.
You must think about it.
On 24th March, Tuberculosis Day was celebrated on the earth.
When I was young, I was scared to hear the tuberculosis.
But when tuberculosis was the cause of death, we were scared.
But now we don't avoid tuberculosis.
The number of tuberculosis patients in our country is much higher than the entire world.
If we have to get rid of tuberculosis, we need proper treatment and certified treatment.
If you leave the medication, there's a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also advise to check up.
This means it's a disease that needs to be tested quickly.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
More than 13,500 Microscopy Centres have more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Treat properly and continue treatment until the disease is cured.
I would urge you to defeat tuberculosis or diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But it's not just the government, the doctor, the medicine until you come forward.
And that's why I urge the countrymen to come and defeat diabetes and get rid of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, many important days are coming in April, especially on April 14, on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
Her 125th birth anniversary has fled all over the country with foolishness.
An 'Mahu' of Panchatirth is his birthplace.
His study in London, Dhiksha in Nagpur.
I am fortunate that this year on 14th April, the birthplace of the revered Babasaheb Ambedkar will be at Mahu.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become a responsible citizen of the country.
We can pay homage to him as a responsible citizen of the country by following that path.
The festival is celebrated in different states.
Somebody calls it 'Nav Samvatsar', some are 'Gudi-Parva', some are 'Year Prince' and some are 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had said last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme can be heard on your mobile phones at around 20 languages.
You just have to call a missed call.
This facility is just a month, and I am happy that about 35 lakh people have benefitted from it.
You should also write the number 81908 81908.
I'm saying again, 81908 81908.
I'm happy to join you.
I want to be your partner in this regard.
I'm so worried about your children's tests.
But if we change our ideas and ideas about the tests, we might be uncomfortable.
I have said in my previous Mann Ki Baat that you must send your advice through the Narendra Modi App.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to have a special interaction with parents, students and teachers.
I want to talk about what I heard, what I've read, what I've been told.
I know the test is going to start in a few days.
How many percent of the tests will be found
I want to say that you set some goals for yourself.
Don't pressurize anyone else's hope.
You must labour, but a realised and possible goal (which can be achieved) should be set for yourself and try to achieve this goal.
When I used to play cricket, I also had a lot of people's desires.
As the time has passed, people's hopes have increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought I would expect myself and set myself for myself.
And if I set myself and fulfil that goal then I can do something good for the country.
And I've always tried to achieve this goal.
My goal was to say and that is why that goal has been fulfilled gradually.
And I believe God will surely give you good results.
Good luck
Don't fall on hope.
You have to make your future.
Your goal is to determine yourself.
Why would I finish my time to compete with others
Why wouldn't I try to break all my records
Friends, don't think of the number game.
Life should always be driven by a great goal, a dream should be taken - a promise should be made.
Whether we are walking on the right path, or not, this test is his sign.
If there's some defect in fulfilling the desires, then don't be disappointed.
Make a spirit of labour and efforts.
Thousands of people have written a number of small phones on my app.
Shrey Gupta said that the healthy body is healthy mind.
Students, you must pay attention to your reading and health so that you can examine it properly.
However, 365 days of our daily routine should be adapted to our dreams and commitments.
I agree with Shri Pravakar Reddie, who asked him to sleep at the right time and take a revision in the morning.
The Prime Minister said that admit cards and other papers should be accessed to testing centres.
Maybe I couldn't say this, because I'm a little eager to sleep.
And when I'm talking about sleep, don't think I'm talking about sleeping for tests.
Don't understand, I'm asking you to sleep to be stress-free to examine.
You mustn't do that.
I believe you're not gonna do that.
It is very important to strengthen the foundation stone of success.
The strong foundation of life is made from the sermons.
The fools and disorders, who work in the morning at noon, feel that the work has been done.
That's why you don't think anything's small.
Do it properly, look at it.
Friends, I've seen sometimes two testators.
One, those who have learned, they're thinking about what was made good.
Secondly, there are other examiners who don't know what questions will come, cannot solve.
I have seen these two testimonies, such as the question papers will not be difficult.
A lot of tests with Daba play.
When you're playing, you don't know what rice you don't know, you don't know what questions will come in the same way.
If you're quiet, eat and sleep, you'll see that your brain can remember the right answer to the right question.
I don't want to look at it as a challenge, can I remember what I have learned for the whole year, can I answer these questions
So calm down, sleep well at night, don't be more self-sufficient, but don't be negative.
I've seen that you're afraid of the test, you're better than that.
So, be self-confidence and best wishes for you.
The Prime Minister said, "Worldnathan Anand has really spoken very important.
His eyes don't move around.
We've heard of the incident of Arjun's life... that bird's eye.
In the same way, I have seen Viswanathan joy, while playing his full attention is towards the goal and it is the peace of his world.
You will not talk to friends - you will be alone, you will be mindful, you will reverse the leaves of many books for the last moment.
That's why laugh and laugh with friends, see that your mind will be quiet.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
I think - No, if I take some rest, I would like it, so I have made a way myself.
Deep breathing - keep breathing deep.
I'm gonna breathe three to five times.
Sometimes it's 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind gets quiet, something's fit to understand.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we see, through the test, we keep hijacking, what's right and what's wrong
If parents are educated at home, they are teachers, then ask them to write what I have written in the entire account.
We're stuck in it.
Friends, don't do that.
What happened at the time of the test has happened.
Speak to the family about other things, remember what laughter is coming out of the day.
If you go somewhere with your parents, remember that scene.
Leave the test for at least half an hour.
In the present context, he is trying to reach out to the world on the importance of traditional Manas.
Popular Murari Bapu gave many important suggestions to the students.
And whatever the situation is, accept it.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy if we follow the situation.
If you don't have any stress, you'll have to be successful in examining your heart.
And if you don't succeed, you're not sorry for failure.
We are grateful for the preachings that Muraribapu gave us to all.
Friends, I want to say another thing today.
My mobile app, Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But friends, if I say that if you start yoga from tomorrow morning, then it will be wrongful to you.
But those who do yoga don't do that today, they don't do that.
If you do yoga then you must do it.
If you don't exercise before the test, you know the yoga exercise near you, you should contact a person who can do some yoga exercise within two to five minutes.
Why do you hurry for this
Make your entire day time specifications so that the traffic jams can be checked on time.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety in the mind.
And one thing, the guidance on the question paper seems to be wasting time to read.
I have seen that sometimes it cannot be understood properly after getting the question papers, but if the guidelines are properly read, we can adhere to it and fix it.
It's important to understand questions.
Rao stressed on patience and in a very short while, he suggested to all the candidates.
That's what I say to my young friends.
Remember, there are many opportunities in our country.
What you need is the capability to be jead, self-sufficient and capable.
If you have all these qualities, you'll be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb, that he has encouraged the children of the country, that is self-reliance, concentration and labour.
Look, guys, wait.
If you're looking for it, you'll be afraid.
A bright future is waiting for you to do good.
My app, Ruchika Dubbs shared her test experiences.
We all know about Electric Bulb's discoverer Thomas Alva Edison, we've read about him in our celebrities.
However, today the light of that bulb is illuminating the lives of the people. That is why the seeds of success are incurred in failure.
He had no legitimate education in Mathematics, no special training.
Harry Potter's famous worldwide today.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
How many problems he had to face, how failed.
Today, not only students but all families, schools and teachers are also involved in this examination.
However, the situation of students is not conducive without the collaboration of parents and teachers.
A team of teachers, parents, even senior students will be formed and it will be easier to examine that they are integrated with integrity.
My App, Shri Keshav Vaishno, wrote that he complained that parents should not have much pressure on students to get more numbers.
I need to encourage you to be ready.
They have to think that they're uncomfortable.
Vijay Jindal writes, don't press your hopes on children.
Enjoy their courage as far as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure about one thing that I want to say, especially my young friends, our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our old generation.
We want to move with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am saying this because today National Science Day.
Every year on 18th February, we celebrate the National Science Day.
In February 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery 'Raman Effect'.
That's why he got the award.
This is the reason why on 18th February, the day is celebrated as National Science Day.
Scientific gentlemen.
Scientific thinking, attraction towards science creates innovation and on the other hand, there is no new inspiration from science and technology.
"I'm C.
I salute Raman and urge you all to increase the interest of science.
Friends, Sometimes it is too late to achieve success and when success comes, the vision of seeing the world changes.
Perhaps I would like to remind the people of the country that you might have heard that there was a very important discovery in the world in science.
Our scientists have identified their capabilities a gravitational wave.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will try to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, we have taken an important decision in the past.
There are only two places in the world.
India is third.
I once again thank all the scientists.
My dear countrymen, one number is saying that you will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving a missed call in this number.
You can hear your mother tongue too.
The number of missed calls is 81908 81908, I say again - 81908 81908.
Friends, your examination is going on.
I have to examine tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will test me.
February 29 - It's Lip Yer.
But yes, you must have seen me understanding how healthy, how self-confidence I am.
I'm going to be tested tomorrow.
If we all succeed, the whole country will be successful.
Thank you very much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat event in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
A few days ago, we have taken Christmas, and now the preparations are going on to welcome the new year.
India is a diverse country.
There are different festivities here.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is connected with the festival.
Festival is a way of employment for the poorest of the society.
I also extend my best wishes to all the citizens of Christmas and my best wishes to the British in the New Year 2016.
2016 I'll be happy for all of you.
New joy, new hope and new resolves can reach the height of a new height.
Be it terrorism, global warming, natural disasters, human beings and other constraints, be it free from all things.
You know, I use the technology completely, so I know a lot.
Many go out to spend Christmas vacations.
All other facilities in the field of tourism are being taken care of, but he has attracted a special look, where tourists visit and live, we must be keen to keep the tourist spots clean.
The cleaner our tourist centres, the more India's pictures will be bright at the doorsteps of the world.
I welcome the thoughts of Shri Sauleshvarkar and give him his words to the countrymen.
He did a new job that has been published in newspapers.
So I think I'll get it to you.
Dilip Singh Malaviya, a resident of a small village, had decided that if someone from the village joins the components of making toilets, then he will make a toilet without a hard worker.
Believing that this is a sacred task, he has built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village so far.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malaviya.
Sometimes we can hear about our country.
As a result of all the efforts of the people, our country is moving faster.
125 crore Indians are moving together and taking the country forward.
We have been able to do all this by providing better education, new technologies and new opportunities for livelihood, providing banking opportunities to the citizens under the protection of insurance, a new reform in the era of international trade and infrastructure development of new business.
I have made smooth lending services through the Mudra Yojana for those people of the common family who could not reach the bank.
When every Indian knew that the whole world was attracted to yoga exercises and when all the countries of the world were united through the International Day of Yoga, we believed that this is our country, the great India.
When this kind of feeling is created in our minds, there is a surprising picture in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness rubber is heard every household.
The participation of the people is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach these villages and bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit is that those government workers who are associated with this scheme will be encouraged to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach this good news to the farmers, the poor, the youth and the women
No government has worked, no government has worked, there is no need to reach the news that they cannot be deprived of what they can get.
They must be informed about their own rights.
Our efforts should be made to reach out to the people in larger numbers, the right and good messages of the common man.
It's a kind of service.
I've tried a little to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should also be involved in this endeavour like you.
I want to reach 125 crore Indians, it is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all come together and encourage the common man to reach out to the common language and the right to reach out to him.
My dear young friends, from the Red Fort on 15th August, I have started up India, stand up.
Since then, it spreads in every department of the government whether India can become a start-up captain.
It is imperative to have new ideas, new tricks, because the world cannot move ahead without new innovation.
Every corner of India has talented young friends, they need only opportunities.
We will urge all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On 16th January, I will meet you in detail and wait for your advice.
There are millions of people in this country who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
On 12th January, 1996, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year, the festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January at Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions about this youth festival
I urge the youngsters to send your advice directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your mind.
It will be reflected in the National Youth Festival, and I will give proper advice and information to my government.
Friends, I have been waiting for your opinion on the Youth Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Deep Chauhan, a blind teacher from Ahmedabad and Gujarat, celebrated the Accessible in India Day in his school.
I am very encouraging from the students and inspired them to help the physically handicapped in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
You're working on this.
You are well aware of their problems and you must have faced many problems yourself.
When there is a chance to meet such people in the society, I have a lot of ideas.
We demonstrate our vision for their problems as per our thinking.
Some people are accidentally victims of loss of lives.
Some people are born to be victims of physical disability.
A lot of words are used for the maintenance of these people and there is a lot of concern about such words.
But all the time, this kind of word is not right for these people, not respectable.
It's true that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Since I was about to be present at that event, I was doing some thoughts about this.
During this time, I think God has given some incompleteness to his body or whose two organs don't work properly, we call it disabled, we know it as disabled.
But sometimes whenever I meet them, I can understand that this person has some incompleteness in our sight, but God has given him some extra power.
These are those who have one or the other organs, which have divine power, which are not in the body of common man like us.
I love this word.
My request to the countrymen, can we propagate the word 'Divang' instead of the word 'Divyang'
On that day, we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Physical and virtual: I will try to facilitate the people with disabilities by developing these two types of infrastructure.
We need many things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, slope roads or rimps at railway stations, easy parking and lifting systems, Braille scripts etc.
Prices are given to gas cylinders in our country.
The government has made some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan Account, Aadhaar Card etc., through the world's largest 'Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme', direct payments to the beneficiaries' bank accounts.
I am proud to tell the countrymen that the biggest Direct Benefit Scheme was successfully launched in the Genes Book of World Records.
This project, known as 'Pahal', has been successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LP-G was benefitted through the Pahal Yojana.
Nowadays, through the MNREGA scheme, employment of rural people is ensured.
There were many complaints about the amount of the scheme.
Now, in most places, this money is directly reaching the bank account of the worker.
There was a lot of trouble with the scalarships of the students, many complaints were coming.
This system has also been started for them and it will be carried forward gradually.
The beneficiaries of various schemes have reached nearly Rs. 40,000 crore directly in bank accounts.
As per a general estimate, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, Republic Day.
It is heartening to note that this year, the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, as the Constitution.
It is a very good experience that a two-day session of Parliament was set up to discuss the Constitution in particular.
The Constitution also emphasizes the duties.
There's a lot of obligations while voting, but why don't you have the obligations in everyday life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, cannot we organise a competition of poetry, debate and poetry in the form of our primary duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and various social organizations on 26th January
I have a new feeling, before 26th January, you can write a poem in your mother tongue or in English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thinking.
You can send it to my MyGov portal.
I am very keen to know about the duties of our youth.
I want to make a small proposal.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, cannot the citizens and school-college students of the country make arrangements for cleaning and decorating the idols of the great personalities established in our cities and maintaining cleanliness in the surrounding areas of replication
I'm not talking about the government system.
As a common citizen, we are eager to take care of the encouraging and encouraging images of these great personalities.
For the society, cannot we make it our natural habit for the country
On 26th January, let us all be aware of the cleanliness of all these idols built in honor of the great men.
For this, people and citizens have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Business and employment will also start with a new zeal.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas must have begun.
Festival has a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new spirit.
But sometimes whenever there is a crisis during the festival, it becomes very painful.
The news of natural trauma is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural trauma that have never heard or thought.
My condolences and condolences to all these families during these disasters.
The State Government uses all power in rescue and rescue operations.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
Today, a team of Indian government rescuers have gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that in spite of this danger, Tamil Nadu will move forward at a rapid pace in a new pace and he will play the role in taking the country forward.
When these risks are happening around, the need to prevent it is increasing.
Now he's changed.
In every field, its capacity buildings are essential to increase excellence.
The government, the middle class, the people, and all the smaller organisations have to work in a very scientific manner.
I am glad that this initiative has been launched through a table-to-skill exercise and a best programme interaction and workshop in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of the farmers not only that they are harvesting in biotechnology but also the problems of the farmers.
It is our nature and generations that are doing so to burn the roots of crops.
First, there was no idea of the damage caused by it, so we are doing it.
Secondly, there was no training for any other way.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall on the city, people started to move against it.
The sadness you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to provide proper training to our farmers brothers and sisters.
If the roots of the crops are burnt then the time will be saved, the labour will be saved, the field will be ready for the next crop but it is not right.
Fruit roots are very precious.
It's a biological serpent itself.
We're burning the food and destroying it.
It's not finished, if these roots are cut off, it can also be animals.
The upper layer of agriculture is burning to burn this root.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which leads to the death of our brave land.
And that's why we have to play a useful role.
Mix the roots of this crop into the ground, it'll be cured.
If this biological fertilizer is used on that land, there are double profits.
I had the opportunity to talk to the artists once.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Whenever they used to cultivate bananas, they had to spend Rs. 5000 per hectare to clean the roots of bananas.
If you didn't get a tracker to clean it, the roots would have been lying like that.
Some farmers then put these roots into the ground by pieces of six or eight inches of measurement.
Because there is so much water in the root of that banana that if there is a tree, a tree or a horse then there is no need to separate water for three months.
The water on the roots of the bananas, so it saves the crops.
The roots that had to spend their money before cleaning are now coming from it.
Our farmer brothers are not less than a scientist.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Disabilities.
I discussed the donation of organs in Mann Ki Baat last year.
I also spoke of the helpline of Noto for organ donation.
The National Organ Day has been celebrated on 27th November.
The portrait was attended by a number of eminent personalities from the society, including filmmaker Rabina Tandon.
Organ donation can save many precious lives.
It can bring immortality in a way.
When any part of the body is transplanted from one body to another, it gets a new life and that man also gets a new life.
What can be more important than this
A National Level Competition was organised through MyGov in Portal to create a series of research on Notor Logo, Donor Cards.
Physical and mentally handicapped people have unlimited courage and ability.
But if we change our vision, change our minds towards them, we can become an inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying even when we're in small problems.
That's why they are the source of our inspiration.
I thank the immense efforts of their lives, their energy, their fighting with life and their complications to the power.
I want to talk to Javed Ahm.
He had to explore some parts of kidneys, small intestines and stomachs in the terrorists.
The spinal cord was also severely injured.
The ability to stand on your own legs ended like him, but Javed Ahmad didn't accept it.
The terrorists couldn't defeat him.
Without any reason, an innocent person suffered such losses and suffered from life-style crisis, but without any anger or grief, Javed Ahmed had to face these dangers with sensitivity.
This is his biggest psychological commitment, and he has served his life in the service of society.
He's always in power, but for the last twenty years he has been working to teach children.
Today, he has done MA in social education and is making a silent revolution as a messenger of disabilities as a social worker and aware citizen.
Can people from every corner of India be inspired by the life of discrimination
I will remember Javed Ahmad's life, penance and human service on 3rd December.
I am not only talking about discrimination but I know that the lamps of inspiration that shine in every corner of India give light to life, new paths.
On December 3, remember all those inspiring people.
Our country is a big country.
There are so many things that people depend on the government.
The government and the government have regular linkages with middle class, lower middle class, poor, marginalised, suffering, exploited and underprivileged.
We have a network of hope workers across the country.
They have done many social work in India.
There's a lot of outbreak of malaria.
Yamuna Manisingh, a hopeful worker of this village, has decided that no one in his own village will die of malaria.
Somebody in the village had a small fever and immediately reached the house.
He starts treatment on the basis of the primary treatment he was taught.
Emphasizing on the use of pesticides in every household.
Just as your child needs to sleep and take care of it, this hope worker, Yamuna Mansingh, dedicated himself to protecting the entire village from mosquitoes and made all villages to prevent malaria.
How many such things are:
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to see them in the eyes of their honor.
They can become a great power of the country.
We have always been a partner of happiness and sorrow.
I convey my honour to all the hopeful people through Yamuna Mansing.
First, on the occasion of Swachh Bharat, the second, the Adarsh Gram Parliament, and the third, on health.
I urge you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might be able to read these things.
You must send it to MyGov portal.
There are many things that don't look at us, but there is real strength for society.
The right philosophy is our biggest strength.
I urge you to come and join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
World warming, climate change is now the most illuminating and worrying thing and it is being recognized as an indicator before every work.
The temperature of the world should not increase, it should be the responsibility of all.
Energy conservation is the first way to prevent temperature rise.
I once told you that at the full moonlit night, the lights of the road should be closed and the lights should be bathed for hours.
That moon's rays should be felt.
Any friend sent me a sight link like this, and he had a chance to see me.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV, has done a lot of studies that perhaps nobody thought.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar energy from the sunlight.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take the swords in the evening, go back in the morning to charge.
Nearly three to four rupees a day, but there's enough light in the house.
The Nurjahan recharged these locks through this solar power throughout the day in the factory.
See, the big people of the world are doing a lot of things for climate change, but one thing seems to be inspiring all of them.
The name of Nurjahan is to illuminate the world.
He's spreading the light in this way.
I would like to congratulate the Honble Prime Minister that he has started a scheme with the Mudra Bank.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is Fund the Unfunded.
Well, the speed I want to move, the speed remains.
Most of these help beneficiaries are vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable and vulnerable.
Absolutely spoke of his zeal.
There's a lot of news coming to me.
One told me now, there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He received loans of Rs. 8. 5 lakh from the bank through the Mudra Yojana.
And he's starting the process of supplying money.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that this campaign will create a new entrepreneur.
And Shailesh Bhosle showed it.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this plan to be more propagated.
All our banks may be more sensitive and help small businessmen.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
People engaged in small jobs are the real strength of the economy of the country.
We want to focus on this.
Good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I spoke of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society.
The International Visits in the Price of Liberty (Rashtriyaam, Jagrium, Expenditure) will be an Internal Security Prize.
To maintain the unity of the country, the Internal Safety River has to be deserted.
I would like to give it the form of a plan for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat and on the portal I had also agreed on this.
I've been told that many suggestions have come.
I am told that those who participate in this will be given certificates.
Big prizes have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season is going on.
It's a very good time to eat and wear nutritious things.
But I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour, all the families should work together, see how awareness will increase and how fresh it will take throughout the day.
Be good in the weather.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, salute all of you
It's the twelveth festival of Mann Ki Baat and it's over a year to see this.
For the first time on 3rd October last year, I was fortunate to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great glory in democracy.
I have a fundamental thought in my life and that's why I have a deep faith in the strength of my people.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I know, what I feel, I can tell you that the strength of the people is much more than what we think.
Our ancestors said that they were part of God.
The feeling that I feel from Mann Ki Baat can say that our ancestors have great strength in thinking, there is a great truth because I have felt this.
I have asked everyone for Mann Ki Baat but perhaps I have been able to see or understand two or four suggestions every time.
But millions of people are actively suggesting me.
It's a funny power.
And likewise, Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing its own thinking of society.
I once spoke about selfie with Dugter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear.
However, lakhs of selfies have come from all over the world and daughters have become proud of this.
And when they gave their selfies with dugters, they have not only proud of their daughters but also awakened a resolution within themselves.
And when all these selfies are seen by others, everybody remembers that they have to give up indifference to their daughters.
People from every corner of India have sent lakhs of such pictures.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that there are such invaluable resources in our country.
Even if we're slightly small, we're gonna buy sweets.
Today, I am happy to say that the sale of Khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it's not for any government advertisement.
Crores of rupees have not been spent.
This was a belief of the people's power, a feeling.
I urge the economically rich people to extend the benefits you have for gas cylinders.
I saw on a TV channel, a widow, she's on the lines of extradition of retiring teachers, gas cylinders.
The middle class, the lower middle class families, who are very difficult to give up the wages, have also left the benefits of wages.
Isn't this a silent revolution
The more the government works with the people, the better it can work as an indicator for the development of the society.
The people of my country are trying to make themselves self-reliant in the welfare of the country by focusing on every small thing.
On the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I have thought of taking a new initiative.
Be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumari from Kashmir, there is no place in India from where people did not call.
It's my own pleasure.
People of all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work as per your advice.
They gave a positive suggestion.
Look at the work that the common man of the country has a positive attitude and this is a huge wealth for the country.
Maybe there were some serious complaints on a two percent phone.
And we have seen a lot of phones from the disabled persons, especially the blind.
One of the reasons for this is that because they don't have a chance to see TV, they must hear the radio.
From this, I understand how important the radio is for the blind.
I got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important to make the government even more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people of all over the country should understand it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this advice will spread in the corner of India through the winds.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
I have spent time with the soldiers of the Air Force, Air Force and Navy, who have protected the water, places and airways.
What wasn't there - the whole history has been envisaged.
The glorious moments during the war, we have been able to achieve this exhibition that we have heard of the bravery and sacrifices of our army, because we did not get any pictures there and videography was not possible.
The battle of Haji Peer or the battle in the north of the country, the battle of Chaminda or Haji Peer Pass, whatever you see, is a thrilling experience and our army is proud of the soldiers.
This exhibition will last for a while.
I urge you people who are around Delhi to see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a young boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but the younger boy has forgotten to call his name quickly.
Cleanliness should be a habit and affordable arrangements should be made.
I have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji spoke of a big deal about cleanliness, but what's going on at last
On the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament and on the other hand, both children of the country are talking about cleanliness and what is the greatest fortune for the country
The movement that has been created on cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards poverty, the awareness that has come towards cleanliness will also compulsory this government to work towards creating a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Institutions - Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Pur Nigams, Mahanagar Parivar Nigams or States or Centres - have to work in this regard.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi by 2019, we will be on the right path to fulfill the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi had once said that if I have to like one of these twos, then I would like cleanliness first, after independence.
Gandhiji had more importance than independence.
Come, let us all follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfill his wishes.
He wanted to know about Deendayal ji's birth centenary.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of life of the great men is a source of inspiration.
Sometimes, historically, somebody is associated with the name of a great prince.
In the coming days, we will remember these great men, their lives will reach every household and we will try to learn something or the other.
I would especially like to mention on 2nd October that day, on the birth anniversary of revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different fashions, different types of fabrics, many other things, but Khadi products should have a special place.
And that is why on this Deepawali, we will surely give a place to our houses, we will wear dresses.
And look, last time the sale of dresses has doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot afford by advertising lakhs of rupees has become possible by your small help.
And that is why I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my mind with joy.
I want you to be a part of this pleasure.
I went to Kolkata in May and some of the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
There was a chance to spend some time with the family members of Subhash Babu.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Maybe they are coming together to the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
But it is a matter of great pleasure for me that there is no opportunity to host such guests in the residence of the Prime Minister in the month of October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu who live in different countries are coming.
I think he's going to be a leader or a leader, listening to his words.
He said, "My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make your youth aware of the registration of the voter, which will increase the contribution of the youth in the coming days and make significant contribution to the formation and management of the government.
Thanks to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on the issue of nomination and voting.
Every voter in democracy is fortunate and this awareness is increasing gradually.
Even a few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission was just conducting the election process, but in the last few years, there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an election agent but an assistant, a voter-friendly, and all their ideas, all the schemes are the centres of the voter.
But only the Election Commission will work, it's not going on.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names in the voter list, they will definitely register and vote.
I'm open on the day of the election to vote, then drink.
It's a sacred duty, all should be done.
Yesterday, I came back to Kashi.
I have met many people, there have been many events, many have met, but I want to tell you about two boys.
But at such a young age, he's amazed at studying physics.
I think he's a lot of reading, surfing internet, knowing about the new use of science.
He was talking about how to get rid of the railway accidents, how to reduce the cost of energy, how the feelings of the robot etc.
It's like a small sandball named Sonampatel.
Sonam's nine years old.
I am surprised that the whole Geetha was at home, but the most important thing is that when I asked him, he was insisting on writing as a volume, explaining the volume, analyzing in Hindi.
I told her to ask her father, she's been doing this since the age of five.
I asked him about his reading, don't he just read Gita and do anything else
The gentleman said, "No, if Sonam is once in the evening, all the messages are over, and if history falls, it's in the evening.
They're astonished about the girl, in the family, she can only do all this.
I really amazed.
Sometimes there's a hobby of celebrity among children, and there was nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given him some special power.
Sandeep ji, what else do you do with me
I have to make a lot of efforts to make this event once a month.
Sometimes half an hour in the morning, we have to wait for an hour.
One year of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
You know how much Subhas Babu used radio
From Germany, he started broadcasting his radio and through radio he used to repeat the movement of freedom to the people of India.
He launched Azad Hind Radio by a weekly News Bulletin.
The radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry and English.
Listening to you, I consider your suggestions and that is why my thoughts open, which reaches you through the astronomy.
I say, but it's yours, and it's my satisfaction.
Once again, I got the opportunity to join you at the Mann Ki Baat event.
The people of far southern India are now celebrating the ONAM Festival and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy Rakshabandhan Festival.
The Government of India has launched several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am glad that many people have come under this scheme in a short span of time.
I had requested a small one to give our sisters such a security scheme on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have a lot of information from which it is understood that since the launch of the scheme, 11 crore families have been associated with it.
I have also been told that about half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken.
A lot of questions were raised, what wasn't done in sixty years would it be so short
This has also helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Campaigns have been opened for the integration of banking sector, economy and low-level people.
This belief has been made that the poor people who can get money from the bank.
Once again I thank all those associated with it and I urge the poor brothers and sisters who have opened accounts in the bank, you will not let this relationship break with the bank.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now you have the responsibility to hold it.
We all have to keep the accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you'll keep it.
A few days ago, the violent events in Gujarat surprised the entire country.
And it is natural that if something like this happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country is sad.
But in a very short span of time, the disciplined citizens of Gujarat - my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation and have taken the path of peace again in Gujarat.
This is the right path of peace, unity and brotherhood and we have to move shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to improve.
Prosperity is the solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the widows of Sufi stream.
I'm really telling you that this experience of listening to them has brought me a music feeling.
The words of those pundits, the tradition of peaceful generosity in Sufi streams have reached me like a musical fountain.
I'm very happy.
Perhaps this true form of Islam has now become the most necessity to reach the copper world.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide, which will benefit the entire humanity and Islam.
I tell others, even though we are different communities, we need to understand the spirit of Sufi.
I am going to have another chance in the coming days and I am fortunate to get this invitation.
Pundits of Buddhist religions from all over the world are coming to India in Buddhism, they will discuss various issues related to humanity all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pt. Nehru visited Buddha Gaya.
This moment is going to be a moment of joy for me to meet all these scholars of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you in particular.
I have already spoken about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You have heard that in Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am telling everybody that the government's minds are open about the issues related to the Land Acquisition Act.
I have been telling you several times that I have agreed to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today, I want to say that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the State.
But I saw that there was a lot of misconception about this, the farmers were scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never be misunderstanding and fear will never come.
I don't want anybody to misunderstand or fear.
I need every demand of the country, but the farmers' demands are most important.
I'm okay, let's finish this period.
I mean, the position that was before my government was formed came back.
But one of them was incomplete.
There were 13 things that were about to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought them in order, but the issue was incomplete due to this dispute.
The welfare of the poor and the farmers in the village is our guidance.
Therefore, on 15th August, I had said that not only the agriculture sector but also the agricultural and farmers welfare department will also be formed.
We are trying to change this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for error anymore, there is no doubt.
If someone tries to scare you, you won't be afraid.
I have to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the 150 years of the 1997 war were completed.
Whenever the war of 1957 comes, it's very natural to remember the Red Fort Scientist.
It is natural to remember the Ministry of Jai Jawan Jai Kishan.
It is natural to remember the sacrifices of those who have sacrificed their lives for maintaining the pride and dignity of the Tricolor National Flag.
I salute all those associated with India's victory of 65, and salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us regularly.
I am very happy that India is working very well in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing well.
I have seen whether young scientists are talking with encouraging, I have seen a new dream in their eyes.
In the Mann Ki Baat event last time, I had said that our students should move towards science.
After this discussion with the scientists, I realized that there are many opportunities in this sector.
I am glad that in just fifteen days, the government has started working in this regard in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it is expected that interview systems will be distributed in small jobs.
Editings have come from many countries of the world.
To reduce health, especially mother and child mortality, 24 countries of the world together agreed on the Cal to Action Plan of India.
This is the first time in any country outside the US.
It is true that even today, about fifty thousand mothers and about one lakh children die every year during or after delivery.
It's too worrying and fearful.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India has been appreciated internationally, yet this number is not less.
As we got rid of polio, we got rid of death due to mother and child tetanus.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays there is a lot of news of dengue.
It's really dangerous, but it's easier to get rid of dengue.
It is directly associated with the Swachh Bharat that I talk about.
We see advertising on TV with dengue, newspapers are printed, but we don't pay attention to it.
Keeping the small things in the house clean, the rules to keep the water clean.
People have started learning at a large scale but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes it seems that we live in a very clean house, a very good system, but I am inviting dengue in the water accumulated in my house.
I urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very precious.
It's not right that the irritation of the surrounding dirty water will be the cause of death.
Around 514 centres across the country have access to free dengue tests.
It's very important to check deaths in time.
Your cooperation in this regard is comfortable.
Cleanliness has to be very important.
Now there will be many festivals across the country from Rakshabandhan to Deepawali.
You will see, this method of cleanliness will be your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to hear a happy news.
I often say that there is no fortune to give life to our country but there is a chance to live for the country.
Two youngsters of my country, two brothers from Nashik, Maharashtra, Dr.
Jitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There's a cycle race in America, "Race Acress America", which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am very happy that these two brothers have successfully successfully achieved the goal of Team India Vision for Tribals for the development of tribals.
See how everybody is trying to take the country forward.
When you hear these things, the heart swells.
Sometimes, we have done injustice to new generations, because of old meditation.
The idea of older generations is that new generations do not know anything, this meditation has been going on for centuries.
I have met a number of youngsters who have lived their lives on the occasion.
Some people said, I celebrate the Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environment.
And I love to think of the young man.
Now in many cities of our country there are cycles and there are people who encourage cycling.
This is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two youngsters of my country have flagged off the national flag in America, I am glad to mention the path of thinking and thinking of the youth of India.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra on this occasion.
The construction of Babasaheb Ambedkar's memorial was stuck for a long time in the land of Indo Mill in Mumbai.
With this, we bought the house of King Henry Road in London where Dr. Babasaheb lived.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for those Indians who roam around the world.
I express my gratitude to the Government of Maharashtra for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud to congratulate them.
It's good to start this year.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will be helpful in enhanced operations.
And I'm glad to remember a happy news.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
I want the poor pulses, and I want a little oil to make square for meals.
I am happy to note that this time the crops have increased by about 50 percent and the oilseeds have increased by about 33 percent.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in our history.
The closer the boundaries of the farmers and the youth of our country are the same.
The war of Kargil was not only in the borders of the country, but in every city of India, in every village, with this war.
This war is also fought by those mothers and sisters whose young boys or brothers were fighting against the enemies in Kargil.
Today, India is capable of speaking at a height of the world for their sacrifices.
I am very happy to see about two crore people visiting the MyGov portal after a year.
Why cannot the persons with disabilities be preserved while booking train tickets through RCTC website
Now it's very small, but it has never been thought of by the government or has not been discussed.
But brother Akhilesh Vajpayee's belief is that the government has taken a lot of consideration and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
The portal of MyGov is ensuring that the logo is being constructed today, the tag line is being constructed, the plans are being formulated.
There is a feeling of a new clean environment in the governance system.
I feel a new consciousness.
There are several suggestions on MyGov portal on what I should say on 15th August.
Film Raghavchari has sent a lot of opinion from Chennai.
You can send a letter to MyGov portal, write a letter on the astronomy and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I mean, it's a good thing to get advice from the public on 15th August for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after an accident, a scooter driver was snatching for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when we look at the statistics, the mind gets hurt.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
For accidents, one dies every 4 minutes for road accidents.
And the biggest concern is that one-third of these dead people are young people from 15 to 25 years of age, and one death can destroy the whole family.
They will do the work of governance, but I would urge my parents that your child should be the driver of two-howlers or for-howlers, all efforts should be made by the family.
Sometimes I see, it's written behind the auto rickshaw, 'Papa Come home hurry back home' - how miraculous it is.
And that is why I am telling you that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education for road safety, technology for road safety, administrative system or in the case of emergency treatment of those injured after accidents, we are bringing road transport and safety bills.
I am contemplating to take some important steps for the use of National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan in the coming days.
I have taken up another scheme that will enhance connectivity of all the roads from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondier highways.
I am contemplating that for the first five and a half hours of the accident, whether the injured person has money, who will not pay, who will not give it, except the wounded person will be able to get better health care and first aid.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033 to report the accident all over the country and have arranged for ambulances, but all these steps have been taken after the accident.
Sometimes I say that the workers are working.
I want to tell you something that happened to me in the last few days, which I liked.
Vijay Viswal showed how his own interests, his arts and his capabilities can be linked to his work.
Discussions about Vijay Vishal's pictures in the coming days can definitely be exchanged.
I remember another thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started working in the entire district which has touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken responsibility in the Rakshabandhan Festival so that all the brothers give their sisters toilets and no mothers and sisters in the entire district have to go to the open defecation.
I knew this kind of news that I want to share with you.
There is a small village named Kesla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets for the last few months.
Now no one in this village has to do open defecation.
The people of the entire village have celebrated a big festival on the occasion after completion of the toilet construction.
This is an excellent example of how the values of society are changing, how the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
In the context of North-East India, Guwahati's Bhavesh Deca wrote to me that however, the work of the people of North-Eastern India is very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
Today, I want to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate Ministry called Development of North-East Region (D-O-N-E-R) was formed.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department takes an important decision that the development of North-East is not possible in Delhi.
Everyone decides that a team of officers of the Government of India will go to Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and will be camping for seven days.
It is necessary to move ahead from Delhi to the east which I call Act East Policy.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of Merce Mission and we are proud.
In the past, we have successfully launched five satellites of Indias PSLV C28 Kingdom.
All these things come for a while, then go.
We don't remember these things.
But sometimes, when we talk to the youth and know what they want to happen in the future, one-and-a-half of the students who say, I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Skill Research Mission under the aegis of new talent.
Now you have to go to other villages if you're doing a mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
But we have to work more for the poor.
We'll complete this.
I have started it, I will also finish it and today I want to talk about different things.
On the one hand, the month of August-September is celebrated in our country.
There's a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your advice on August 15.
Your beliefs will help me a lot.
Thank you so much
When I told you, I didn't think I'd be able to accomplish this.
Millions of people have posted photographs on Twitter, Festival, Instagram.
I have seen one photograph after another, how many diversitys are in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers and seas
I believe that the Indian government has not been able to think about tourism. You have done that big thing.
I like some other pictures so much that I've travelled myself again.
I think if we don't post the photographs of the Belum Cave in Andhra Pradesh, we might not have known the places that are hidden in our country.
But on 21st June, the sight that we have seen is very strange, I think there was no country where the sunlight reached, where Yoga did not welcome the sun.
I can point out that the sun does not set in the world of yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the people of the world have honoured and rehearsed Yoga.
I'm very happy.
He was happy to see the Sin River and the Ifall Tower for the people of France, and they have also given equal respect to Yoga for that place.
People have practiced yoga at Times Square in New York.
If you talk about Australian Sydney, the picture of the Opera House appears in front of the eyes.
The people of Australia have practiced Yoga at the Opera House and have given Yoga the same respect as the Opera House.
Whether North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Duomo Cathedral, Yoga has honoured us all over the world.
I am glad that when 21 June, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, performed Yoga as the Chief of the United Nations.
Similarly, members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force showcased very beautiful yoga practices.
Our soldiers have joined India's Siachen on white ice sheets, wherever our naval ships were, they participated in the programme of Yoga.
Yoga in Delhi has been ranked in the Ginesbook of World Records.
It feels like a new question from everywhere in the world - a new joy and a new enthusiasm - a new integrity is emerging.
A few days ago, when I travelled in a tour to a young family in Vietnam, the photograph was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, childhood, village-urban, better or developing countries have all connected with Yoga.
Yoga really binds the whole world in one thread.
I don't know how scholars and giants will see this incident, but I am feeling one thing that every Indian can be proud that the whole world is keen to know India.
Everybody's interest in knowing India has increased.
The world wants to know the values, traditions and heritage of India.
The responsibility of all of us is to disintegrate this heritage and disintegrate it into everyone.
If we are proud of our heritage, we can do this.
Sometimes we know something so much that we don't see any innovation like our family values, we don't know that our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why don't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be surprised and I will be surprised to believe that there are many such excellent things that the ancestors have given us.
The achievements of the International Day of Yoga have brought a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
We are responsible for providing good Yoga to the world.
I believe you can create a database on where to learn Yoga and where to get Yoga teachers.
I am also looking at the events of the past, the government is working, the government is very active and we have seen the consequences of the fact that if the goal is fixed.
When we were hungry around us, as we heard a year ago, nothing will happen - nothing will happen.
AYUSH is a department of the government.
Nobody has given any importance to this
But on the day of Yoga Day, this small department has led and has organized such a big event all over the world.
If the goal is fixed, the smaller departments can do well, it's his sample.
A few days ago, the world has seen how our people protected the people who were in danger from Yemen.
Within a few hours, Indians have moved ahead to help Nepal.
If the government is active then all the bank employees come forward to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank and within a few days, millions of Indians are connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools to make toilets in the Red Fort and said that we have to complete this work by 15th August.
It was a brave task to fulfil the work that could not be done in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government worker, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, I started three public safety projects from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been associated with the Jan Suraksha Yojana, though we have to take this project forward.
Raksha Bandhan Festival coming in the next month.
We cannot facilitate the safety of our mothers and sisters by creating a strong mass movement before this festival in collaboration with all the countrymen
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, it can be a big gift for the sister on rent.
When I came to the Mann Ki Baat program, many people sent advice to me.
Many people have advised me to talk about rain.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan Mahashay from Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni Mahashay and Divyanshu Gupta Mahashay told me to talk about the rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season gives a lot of pleasure to the mind.
Any old man wants to enjoy the first rain water.
You are also enjoying hot tea with hot cotton, fresh and bread in this year.
As the sun rays give us energy, the rain gives us energy.
The window water is very precious.
As a citizen, we have to create a habit of saving water as a people of the society.
The water of the village, the water of the city, it should be our commitment.
Rainwater Harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Whatever the cheque dam, watershed development, small ponds, small ponds in the field, we have to save water.
This port is on the coast, so the rain water was collected in the house for sweet water.
At that time, all these efforts were made to conserve rain water.
We can do this too.
And I advise you to get from my direct and successful experience.
It's a whole rural technology.
When you plant a tree, put an old soil on the tree and fill it with water.
I'm gonna be filled with water once or twice a month.
See, this tree will grow very soon and will be very strong.
I will also tell the farmers that you don't wander around your fields and plant trees.
And we also know that in the rainy season the disease spreads more through water.
Bacteria are active to increase humidity in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is very important this time.
You should drink pure drinking water at this time.
It's right, as much as we're careful, the disease will be far away.
I want water, I want rain, but I want to avoid diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently launched three new projects, especially for the people of the city.
There are five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house for electricity, drinking water, toilets and school for girls.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give our homes to every countrymen.
I'm connected to all of you through social media.
I am getting advice from you and I am very happy about the work of the government.
But when this government scheme becomes a person, a society or a village's own project, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village of Haryana, Sh. Sunil Jaglan Mahasay has started a very funny effort.
And this creates such an environment that every father puts selfie with his daughter to post on social media.
The number of sands in Haryana is very less than the boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there are such conditions which are very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that's why I urge you to participate in Selfie with your daughters.
Along with this, write a tagline to strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write a beautiful tagline, in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I'll re-touch your selfie with your daughter.
We all can make this project a mass movement in a way, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
Make our country a hawk.
I'm telling you from my experience, you're taking this effort forward.
Make it part of your life.
And one thing - Incredible India - You must send the pictures wherever you go.
Our country- Will all such worlds know how much diversity is in our country
I think the pictures you are sending are very less in handicrafts.
You can also post the handicrafts of your area in Incredible India.
There are several things in your city - the poor people also produce various things.
And we have a simple medium to reach.
My dear countrymen, this is all today.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I have announced the government's big schemes but not that.
I'm working day and night.
I'm talking to you slightly smoothly through this event, Bass is my pleasure
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine what's going on in the middle.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say, sounds, sounds and throats were mine, but the words were yours, men were yours and yours.
But this Sunday waited for me a lot.
Well, the last chance has come.
In a household environment, the word Mann Ki Baat, which can change in society and life, its sustainability is the birthplace of a new inspiration and thus strengthening the spirit of a New India.
My close exchange with you was a part of this spiritual journey.
Several people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in those busy polls.
You have the right and I can understand this talent.
I think I'll ever tell you about the situation at that time.
But today I feel that if I talk about that then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Polling exists only when I was out.
Most of them found political meanings.
But it was for me to meet myself.
You can say I went to meet me.
I don't know when to say... but I must say, because you have the right to me.
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I always feel a positive energy in your efforts.
Sometimes some of your words make my thoughts even less.
People spoke of the challenges faced by the nation and the society, and also spoke of the solutions.
I have noted that there is a detailed description of the problem in the letter, but it has a specialty that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
He expressed his distress over the dirty waste and welcomed this effort towards cleanliness.
When someone talked about the environment, he also spoke of his own efforts while feeling sad about pollution.
He recalled the way he is taking, and reiterated the imagination that he had kept in mind to prevent environmental pollution.
That is, a glimpse of how I can solve the problem with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a vision for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of internal energy, capability and talent among the people of the country.
Just need to guide the energy and talent to the right path, to give him the opportunity, to use it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that the progress of the country has to connect the energy and activity of 130 crore people.
I would like to say one more thing that I have a lot of letters in Mann Ki Baat, there are innumerable phones, many messages, but there are very few complaints.
You can imagine that somebody is writing a letter to the Prime Minister of the country but doesn't want anything for yourself
This is an example of the higher thinking of millions of people in the country.
My mind is happy today.
And that is why I finally announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will come back to you.
Let us take this idea forward the sustainability of Mann Ki Baat.
The movement against him was not limited to political circles and political leaders.
I don't feel hungry when we eat from time to time.
Just like this, the importance of the rights of the Republic of India in everyday life is felt only when that right is lost.
And this is not because the Indian Constitution has taken some steps that will lead to the growth of democracy.
There is a need for constitution and legislation to facilitate the system of society.
And that is why the country dedicated to a whole nation, not for itself, but for protecting democracy.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the largest election process was completed in our country, where wealth from the poor, everyone was ready to take part in this campaign and decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we can't achieve its importance
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Sixty one crore
The number may seem to be normal, but if I look at the whole world, I will say, without a sign, more than any country's population has voted in India.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
These are the enormous and widespread indicators of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections 2019 are still the largest democratic elections in history.
You can imagine what a great event and human resource are required to fulfil this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and workers.
In order to achieve this great sacrifice of democracy, on the one hand, almost three lakh defence personnel have performed their obligations and twenty-two lakh police personnel of different states have worked tirelessly.
As a result of their hard work, this time, more than the previous elections have been voted.
In this election process, about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being arranged.
To ensure that nobody refuses to use his vote.
Polling stations are set up for only one female electorate at a remote location in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two days to reach that place.
This is the real honor of democracy.
This is also the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
There's another information about which we can feel proud.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female electors in this election is almost equivalent.
One more inspiring information is that there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament, which is a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and all those associated with the voting process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to me many times, not Book, Book.
I wanted to use the habitants if they could be booked instead of breaking the flowers
Another story, which drives my heart deeply, is Eidgah.
The story is a boy's sympathy, a pure love for his grandmother.
When Hamid takes a spoon from the fair for his grandmother, it really feels that human love, compassion can be unprecedented and incomplete.
The last line of this story is that we think, it is an unprecedented truth of life, "The child has played the role of Hamid, the old Hamid," the old man, I, and the girl changed into me.
A very heartbreaking story is Puss Ki Night.
This story shows the obstacles in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after the loss of their crops, the farmers are happy, because they don't have to sleep in the fields in the winter.
Though these stories are often centuries old, its relevance still feels the same.
After reading the story, I feel a different kind.
When the book is about to be read, in a media, I was reading about the library in Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that that library is located in a village in the deep forest of Idukki.
A primary school teacher, P.
V. Chinnathampi worked extraordinaryly for this library.
There was a time when the books were brought here on the back filled in the bush.
Today, this library shows a new direction to all the tribal children.
Gujarat, Wangche Gujarat, a successful initiative.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Gugal Guru, I would also urge you to take some time and give some place in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and you will definitely write about the books that you can read on Narendra Modi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things that are not only present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov.
Belgavir Pawan Gowdai, Sithangshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar and Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many other water related problems.
Water has a great impact on our culture.
It has been said about the water in Suktam: Your High Mao Bhubaneswar: Dharatan in No Energy, Yo Bah: Shivatmo Ras: Tasya Bhajayateh N. Ushtiriva Matar.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are being damaged every year.
You will be surprised to know that in a year only 8 percent of the water received from rains is preserved in our country.
Just 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that like other problems, we will find solutions to this crisis through public participation, with the strength of the people, with the support, cooperation and commitment of 130 crore people.
A new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country keeping in mind the importance of water.
This will facilitate quick decisions on water related matters.
A few days ago, I tried to make some innovations.
I wrote a letter to all the villagers of the country.
I had written to the villagers to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to communicate with the villagers.
I am glad that they have shown full enthusiasm in this regard and on the 22nd of this month thousands of crores of people have worked in Panchayats.
People in the village have decided to save one drop of water.
Today, at the Mann Ki Baat event, I want to listen to a village panchayat.
Listen to what the Panchayat chief of Lupung village of Katkamshandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us a message: "My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I don't wish all the villagers, all the Panchayats and their activeness.
There are many Panchayat leaders across the country who have been engaged in water conservation.
What I said, it is possible for everyone to get a big positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is to save water, water conservation.
Reforms of water drains are underway in Punjab.
This provides relief from water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir in Thimaipalli, Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the village.
The construction of small ponds built in the field of poetry in Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was talking about a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, there were 20,000 women at one place to revive the river.
I was also reading about the women of Garhwal who are working very beautifully to keep rain water together.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I urge three people of the country.
My first request is: Let us launch a mass movement for water conservation as the countrymen gave a mass movement to cleanliness.
Together, we all resolve to save every drop of water, I believe that water is a prasad, water from Parameswar.
I initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Whether it is the world of cinema, sports, media friends, people belonging to social organisations, people belonging to cultural organisations, artists, everybody should lead this movement through their own methods.
Awaken the society, connect everyone and tied it.
You see, we'll see changes in front of your eyes.
Come, let us create a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to save water.
You can share your content using the Hashtag Janshakti4Jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I thank you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
On 21st June, once again, on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-three or four generations of one family, full of enthusiasm, have celebrated Yoga Day together.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for the health care.
If a Yoga lover welcomes the sun in every corner of the world, then his entire journey ends with the sunset.
Presidents, Prime Ministers from all over the world, eminent personalities and common people have shown me how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a large family filled with happiness.
We all know that Yoga is the need of a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive person.
Therefore, Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, the Prime Minister's Awards were announced for its unique contribution to the promotion and development of Yoga, which must be a good conversation to me.
The awards have been given to the organizations of the world who have played a vital role in promoting and promoting Yoga.
Like Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan has a number of institutions and training courses.
And where can Indians stay behind in Yoga
The Yoga Schools of Munger, Bihar, which have been demonstrated for the past few decades, have been honored.
Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University were also honoured by Swami Rajarshi Munic.
The commemorative celebrations of Yoga and honouring those who have delivered the message of Yoga at home, both of them have added differently to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey has started with new ideas, new feelings, new resolves and new energy, I have been waiting for your thoughts.
You can connect yourself with your thoughts, it is important for me to have Mann Ki Baat.
Keep your blessings with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Come, let us all sit together and fulfil all the duties of life to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The Mann Ki Baat will be interacting with you again in the next month.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, my mind is going to start Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Bharat Mata lost her brave saints.
To tackle the challenges faced by the country, all of us have to forget caste, traditionalism, regionalism and all the rest of us so that we can take stronger, stronger and more effective steps against terrorism.
Our armed forces are indicative of indomitable courage.
You have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The soldiers have committed to the destruction of terrorists and their abusers.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, there was an inspirational message of their families through the media, which inspired the people of all over the country.
Ratan Tagore's father, Ramninjanji, in Bhagalpur, Bihar, has inspired all of us with a strong commitment in this hour of grief.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight the enemy of the country and if needed, he will be present in the battlefield.
The entire country is convincing the bravery of Meenaji, the wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He promised his only son to join the CRPF.
When the martyr Vijay Soren's dead body covered with the National Flag reaches Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son says that he will also join the army.
With the zeal of this sufficient child, this firm commitment and thought today reflects the feelings of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, the Ware Memorial waiting for all of us in such a long time since independence is going to be completed.
It is natural for the countrymen to have a lot of questions and receptions in this regard.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has expressed his happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial in Udupi, Karnataka.
I was surprised and distressed that there was no National War Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarjibhai was born on February 29.
You all know that this special day comes once in four years.
In the easiest, peaceful personality, Morarjivai was one of the most loyal leaders in this country.
In our independent India, the record of getting the most budget in Parliament is named after Morarji Bhai Desh.
During that difficult time, Morarji gave the right leadership to India when the democracy of the country was in a terrible position.
Morarjibhai patriotized himself in the movement against the needy situation, to protect this democracy.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of money.
The day's government arrested him and put him in prison.
But in 1977, when Janta Party won the elections, he became our Prime Minister.
The 44th Constitution was amended during his Prime Ministers tenure.
The event is very important because the 42nd Amendment to the Essential Status is proposed where there were some more proposals to exclude the power of the Supreme Court so that our democratic values would be finished.
As a result of the 44th Amendment Proposal, all the functions of Parliament and Assembly were made available in newspapers.
Besides, some of the powers of the Supreme Court have been revised and the amendment proposes that the fundamental rights of the citizens should not be deducted in accordance with the provisions of 20 and 21 of the Constitution.
Once again, I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, every year, there was a lot of joy in the minds of the people about the Padma awards.
I want to talk to you about some people like this today.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion.
He has done an excellent job to bring this rare art to a new generation.
"Tree of Life" made by Abdel Gaffur, I presented to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the Padma awardees, everyone knows Sabby of Marathwada as a servant of Gomata.
The way he served Goddess Goddess, he is amazing.
Madurai is Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who tried to strengthen and self-sufficient the damaged and the exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has been training Yoga exercises all over the world at the age of one hundred and has made 1500 Yoga teachers so far.
He did not only save 50 hectares of forests, but also sent ten thousand women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work, today the people of the village do 18 at the time of birth of every child and plant 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl.
He also dedicated himself to the pilgrimage of self-reliance of blind children by creating an Institution called 'Chuchu Mahila Sevakunj'.
It is a matter of fact that he has also done the work of technological education with agriculture, my dear countrymen, this is probably the first time that 12 of those who have been awarded the Padma Awards this year are farmers.
Normally, very few people belonging to agricultural sector and very few of them are in the list of Padma Shri.
And this is the changing picture of India.
My dear countrymen, today I am talking to you all about a heart-breaking experience, I have achieved this thing myself for the past few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PM-JYA) and PM Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about twelve lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how many changes have come in the lives of the poor.
If you know any poor person who cannot be treated due to lack of money, you have told them about this scheme.
The scheme has been launched for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters, the school is going to start testing.
The educational boards across the country will initiate preparations for the examination of Parliament and 12th grade boards.
My heartfelt congratulations to the test takers, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a large number of Town Forums were organized at the Pariksha Pe Charcha in Delhi.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their teachers, their parents, YouTube, and to all those involved in the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, India will talk and it will not be a matter of worship.
Perhaps there is no day when there is no festival or festival in our country or there is no special significance because we have thousands of years old heritage.
And in a few days, the Mahashivratri comes and this time the Shivaratri falls on Mondays and the Shivaratris, our minds are filled with sacred feelings and devotion.
I am extremely impressed by the power of this disability.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat program.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes you have to read your letters, talk to you, or listen to your suggestions, you have made me one of your families.
It's a pleasure to me.
Friends, Electoral Republic is the biggest festival.
For the next two months, we will be busy with the election.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
The life of the people, shelters, education and spiritualism has been demonstrated.
The Siddhganga Math is organised by the concerted cattle.
I conveyed my heartfelt gratitude to such great men.
But today I want to tell you something about this.
Just imagine, for a single vendor.
If you don't want to get rid of any reason, then you must have a psychological distress.
I would like to urge all the dignitaries of the country to enroll and enroll the televisions of the Ourselves.
I am confident that a large number of youngsters will register their names and strengthen our democracy in the partnership of the people.
Here the British rulers were the teachers of Bharat Mayevir Santan Colonel Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurubax Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz.
When I was in the Karanti Mandir of Lal Kilas, the members of Netaji's family used to use me a very dramatic pattern.
He used to use this.
I have organised the museum to inspire people to watch the museum and inspire people.
The bravery of the heroes of our country, the story of our countrymen is an integral part of our new generations.
In this month, on 30th December, I celebrated the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
But it was the 75-year-old House of Azad Hinds.
"Delhichlo", "You're my son, I am your freedom", has dedicated this kind of reception to the whole of India.
A few years ago, there was a decree that would be publicized by Netaji.
I enjoyed this.
I believe that the day when Netaji had visited the residence of the Prime Minister.
I am told that the radio stations are also published in the week-long programmes like English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Puducherry, Urdui etc.
Business was a highly magnificent land.
The museum is a historic exhibition and the Observing Art Works of the three generations are being preserved.
Here, the best artisans for Amritashergil, Rajarabirma, Avanindranath Takur, Gagan Nath Takur, Nandlal Bose, Jiminirai and Shailjamukharji have been depicted.
He's made a lot of paintings.
He has also asked the cattle birds to enhance their natural beauty and enhance their beauty through artisans.
And it is surprising that Gurudev Rabindranath Taku didn't belong to this artistic artist.
He said that even though the paintings of audience should be considered by the journalists, they should be shown by the artisans.
Orpenting has also been shown in Russia and the United States in Europe.
I'm sure you're going to visit the Kranti Mandir painting.
My dear countrymen, the land of Indian saints.
Our saints have enjoyed the spirit of harmony and social empowerment through exchange.
It's like that - Terrorism.

In this context, the geo-taggery of three crore projects under Manrega has been carried out.
Our satellites are a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
It is our contribution to the world's relations.
The South Asian Satellites have enhanced our neighbourhood through an unprecedented effort.
They're on the trails of the family.
Normally, I don't want to enthusiastically enthusiastically.
ASEANSOLNI residents of 1000 years of Abhinavshakhelo India Youthgames have the highest gold medal.
Akshata Baswani has won the Gold in Kamtivarottalans in Karnataka's Ektik Krishak family.
When I am talking about the creation of a New India, this is a Tsensitive New India.
The components of the sportsperson will not be the doorsteps of the people of Maharashtra, but have been exchanged in small towns, forgiveness, village to accommodation, youth and youth.
My little guys, it's coming up on the day of the test.
In Himachal Pradesh, I will have to tell you about these tests and tests by the warriors.
Bhagulji, thank you for this context.
Yeah, some family is preferring this test season.
Academics, their Baba-Ma and Academic-trainers are the most profound ones in the field of testing.
I convey my best wishes to every student, their parents and teachers.
Today's Mann Ki Baat celebrations will communicate with me, but you will be happy to be present on this occasion.
There will be a lot of legends in the context of testing, especially with the unprecedented testing of the States Free Exam.
In this regard, I had tried to concentrate on this matter, and it is a matter of great pleasure that people are talking about this.
Wherever we are, there are 2 minutes to pay homage to the martyrs.
We will recall the dreams of reminding the revered Bapu, the creation of a New India, the responsibility of the citizens.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We're going to enter 2019.

All this has been possible in the unprecedented efforts of 130 crore people.
My dear countrymen, in December, we lost some excellent countrymen.
The loss of lives of Dr. Jaya Chandran in Chennai on 19th December.
Narasamma was a mother-in-law who helped in delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
He was awarded Padma Shri in the beginning of this year.
Dr. Jaya Chandran and Sulagitti Narsamma have many visionary personalities who have sacrificed their lives for the betterment of society.
When I talk about healthcare, I want to mention the social efforts of the doctors in the business of Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of my party leaders tell me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor for free by camping.
Now every month hundreds of poor people are benefitting from this camp.
The encouragement of these doctors and friends in service is commendable.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful mission due to our integrated efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people have joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
This Mahayojana of Swachhta is a part of the zealous participation of the city, voluntary organizations, school-college students and the common people of Jabalpur.
Here I can know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever time comes, I try to know about this kind of inspiring thing by going to the Better India Dot Come website.
I am happy that these days there are many websites that introduce us to the lifestyle of inspirational people.
You can easily learn the language of Sanskrit by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati dot in.
I believe that many people will know about these heroes who brought about change in society.
It is very easy to spread negativity, but there is a lot of good work in our society and it is possible that 130 crore Indians are working together.
Every society has a different significance of sports.
Whenever there is a game, the audience also gets a swing of brightness.
I want to tell you about Hanoya Nisar, a girl from Kashmir, who won gold in Caret in Korea.
Twenty-fourth year old Hanoya lives in the infinite state of Kashmir.
I wish him a bright future from all over the country.
Rail conveys his best wishes and blessings.
There are many discussions in the media about another daughter, sixteenth Rajini.
You must have fallen.
The royal girls won the Gold Medal in the Jubilee Boxing Corps.
He commemorates his father, Jasme Singh, who sold Lassi at a waterway shop.
Rajni told her that she had to acknowledge her father's excuses and sufferings to reach this place.
James Singh went to work every day before Rajni and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajini wishes to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to enhance his spirit, to achieve his dreams.
The royal boxing practices started with old glosses, because the financial condition of his family wasn't good.
Despite all the opponents, Rajni didn't lose courage and continued to teach boxing.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate his father-in-law Jasm Singh ji and Ushrani for staying close to Rajni and encouraging him.
This month, the twenty-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni cycle of Pune has achieved the pride of being the fastest Asian in the world.
He ran about 300 kilometres per day for 159 days.
You imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His incentive towards driving the cycle is really commendable.
Resistance never stops.
When we listen to other such examples, we also get inspiration in every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, in January there are many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttaran, Magh Bihu, Maghhi etc.
In all these festivals, the color of traditional dance will be seen all over the country, then it will be burnt with the joy of harvesting fruits, there will be blooming colors in the sky.
The sports event will be organised somewhere, then it will be sweet to feed each other with sweet sweets.
These festivals are somehow associated with agriculture and livelihood.
During this time the sun is renowned and the sun enters the magnificent race.
Since then, the day gradually grows and the winter crops begin to grow.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to our foodgrains farmer brothers and sisters.
Oneness in diversity is one India, Shreshtha Bharat.
We can see how closely connected these festivals with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature cannot be seen separately, here people and groups are one.
Another beautiful example of our intimation with nature is the Festival based calendar.
These calendars also contain details of the planets along with the festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with the events related to natural and physics.
The moon-source calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun is composed of the festivals and festivals.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are held in many places on the locations of the planet.
The festivals like Gujarati-Padwa, Cheti-Chand, Ugadi are celebrated according to Chandra Calendar, as well as Tamil Puthandu and Vishakha, Vaishakhi, Pilla Vaishak, Bihu etc.
We have a special objective of protecting rivers and water in many mountains.
Six Parvati rivers and reservoirs are connected to sun worship.
Millions of people bathe in the holy rivers on Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, these festivals teach and inspire each other to create brotherhood with each other in a very easier life.
I convey my best wishes and wishes to all of you for 2019. You must enjoy these festivals.
Sharing the photographs taken on this occasion with all of you to see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can feel proud and we can make the whole world supreme and that is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
In many films, the traditions and grandeur of the fairs have been depicted and they are true and the greater the heritage of the Kumbh is as important as it is.
People from all over the country and the world come to participate in Kumbh.
In this Kumbh, the people of faith and devotion have come to the fore.
Millions of people from all over the country are coming together.
The tradition of Kumbh is enriched and enriched by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and Mahatmas have started reaching Kumbh Mela from now on.
Last year, the UNESCO Kumbh Mela was registered in the Intellectual Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries have seen the preparations for Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of several countries together.
The Kumbh Mela to be organised in Prayagraj is likely to come to more than one and a half countries.
This can be a very big learning experiment for the youth, especially for the youth.
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for Kumbh are underway.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in Kumbh.
This Akshayvat was shut in the fortress for thousands of years, so that the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the doors of the Akshay Bat have been opened for everyone.
Whenever you go to Kumbh, you must share different features and pictures in social media so that more people are inspired to go to Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality should be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh of faith should be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national harmony.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the celebrations of the Republic Day are very satisfying to the people of the country and on that day we recall those great people who presented our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
Honourable for us, the President of South Africa, Shri Siril Ramafosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day.
Popular Bapu and South Africa have an unprecedented bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan has become Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had started the first Satyagraha and stood in a hurdle against the brilliance.
He set up Finnics and Tolstoy Farms from where the sound of peace and compassion was raised all over the world.
He had the power to spend so many years in prison and inspiration from revered Bapu.
Mandela said, Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he used himself on the path of truth.
There is a comprehensive discussion on how to strengthen the security of the country and the country.
In this conference, I have announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity and this award will be given to those who have contributed somehow to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He has worked for the entire life to keep India integrity intact.
He said that the diversity of the country contains unity.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel by this award of unity to him.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patan.
He left his last breath at Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India got his blessings.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, the biggest service is to remove the sufferings of the people.
He was full of bravery, bravery, sacrifice and religion.
His extraordinary knowledge was in weapons and sciences.
On one hand, he was a Tirandaj, a Gurumukhi, a Braj language, a Sanskrit, a Persian, Hindi and English.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good events in the country that are not being discussed.
Several events are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Efforts are being made to create safe and healthy food habits.
The Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organised across the country as part of the Eat Right India Mission.
The expedition will take place from 27th January.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
For good health, nutritious diet is first needed.
Whether individual life or national life or social life is a source of inspiration.
Let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovation, innovative resolve, innovative goals and innovative heights.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
The 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat is being completed today.
It's called Golden Jubilee Episode.
This is the 50th edition of all the letters and phones received this time.
Through the MyGov App, Vikas Yadav from Bhagukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna and Manika Jain of Delhi, Government from West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur, etc.
 This question is very natural.
Why did Modi bring back the radio when people were often forgetting radio in today's era
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to this radio.
I heard in the radio, there's talk of breaking the bomb.
The shopkeeper said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had listened to the radio on the occasion of breaking the bomb, testing atomic bombs.
The shopkeeper's gladness, dancing, I was wondering that the people were listening to the radio throughout the day in this area, in the ice covered hills, in the forests.
I am thinking of Radio Communication Research and its far-reaching impact.
After that, when I am the Prime Minister, it is natural to take the help of the strongest connectivity.
Since May 2014, when I started assuming the charge of the Chief Secretaries, I thought that our country's unity, our glorious history, bravery, diversity, cultural diversity, the work of mankind, its men, emotion, sacrifice and penance should be expanded to all the people of the country.
I have reached 50th episode every month to read lakhs of letters, to listen to the phone calls, to know about various apps and to communicate with them, to talk about my own light joy.
The outcome of the survey is very encouraging.
It is reported from the survey that seventy percent of the listeners are listening to Mann Ki Baat and every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most of the people think that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced optimistic thinking among all sections of the society.
Peoples movement through Mann Ki Baat has been widespread.
There have been several discussions on the issue of Haas Tag India positive.
This is a smooth change in which people are coming forward for social service.
Modi will come and go, but our country will last forever, our culture will remain intact.
These small towns of 130 crore Indians will always survive.
The new inspiration filled with zeal and zeal will bring the country to a higher height.
I read letters and feel such a feeling and work in my mind.
I have achieved both things myself and share them and share with you all.
But who knows when these things will reach home again.
Sometimes there will be such a power of any government that the schemes like selfie with dugter will start from a small village in Haryana, not only in the country but in the whole world.
Every section of the society, even the celebrities, are associated with this thing, and the thinking of the society has been depicted in a modern dialect in which modern generations are shown.
Sometimes it has been funny about Mann Ki Baat, but in my mind, 130 crore Indians are always sitting.
Their minds are my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government talk, it is a society.
There are many aspects of social life, including politics.
If politics becomes the original thing, it cannot be reflected in a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that other talents of society are neglected.
It is our common responsibility to keep in mind the talent of mankind and other things of society for a bright future of the country like India and a small and immense effort to move forward in this direction of Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the Prime Minister but asking a close friend of yours.
There's also a toll free number - 1  7800, calling there, people record their messages in their lips.
I try to read the letters and comments as far as possible before the Mann Ki Baat.
I heard a lot of phones.
This time, as much as the Mann Ki Baat episode is coming forward, I keep on paying attention to your views and ideas while visiting different places.
That letter is not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have lived the lives of a devotee about 40-45 years and went to most of the districts of the country and I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
And that's why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place.
After that, I will notify some information such as the name of the village, the name of the person.
In fact, in Mann Ki Baat, it is myself, but for example, emotion and life force are my countrymen and I would like to thank all those who contribute to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to take the name Mann Ki Baat till date, but they keep sending their letters and their words without disappointment.
I am confident that your message will come to me more than ever before and will make the Mann Ki Baat more attractive, effective and useful.
It is also tried that all the letters that are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be taken into account by the concerned departments.
I would like to thank all the media, television, other TV channels, social media friends.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the most people in their hard work.
In this way, they became Narendra Modi for thirty-three minutes.
I would like to congratulate them for their talent and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your regional language.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the media friends who are regularly campaigning for Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
No political person is satisfied with the media, as if he is covered very little, or a negative coverage, but the media has taken a lot of issues published in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Nidhi ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secret.
What I'm doing is perhaps in all families.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like that of those youngsters, keeping myself in that situation and keeping myself balanced with their opinion, I try to make a length.
We have some old bagges in our lives, if they don't have to come forward, it's easier to understand anyone.
I don't understand any of the two, sometimes one has acknowledged his thinking and has made his own.
The present young men have a good quality, they don't do what they don't believe, and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind.
Often people talk about the communication gap between the elders of the family and the teenagers.
But most of the households have a limited discussion with the teenagers.
Often there's talk of reading or habits, life style, don't do it.
It's also a matter of concern that the conversations are slowly decreasing in the family without advertising any conditions.
If we take revenge and don't talk, any media is important.
I am communicating with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I have always learned from the thoughts and thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are innovative, innovative and incredible.
Someone said that young students want to do different things together.
I say, what's wrong with it
They're transparent in Multi-Tasking, so they do it.
If we look around, we will see that there are social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other sector, the youth bring a big change in the society.
Those youngsters who have dared to question and dream.
If we can give up the ability to take decisions on the youth and if they openly express their thoughts then they can bring about the creative changes in the country and they are doing this.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MyGov website, Binita ji has written that this time we need to say something about the Convention Day on November 26, in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of the constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for your advice.
Yeah, tomorrow's Convention Day.
Let those great personalities remember those who have formed our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26 November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic task of constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great talented people gave us such a broad and broad constitution.
The extraordinary pace of constitution that they have built is a unique example of time management and productivity.
Inspired by this, we are also able to finish our jobs in record time.
The Convention was a gathering of the greatest talented people of the country, which was responsible for providing a Constitution to every country to empower the people of India and the poorest of the poor.
The basic feature of our Constitution is the detailed description of rights and duties.
The balance of these two things will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens of the country.
If we respect each other's rights then your rights will also be safeguarded and if we take our responsibility in the Constitution then we will also be able to protect our rights.
I remember that in 2010, in Gujarat, in 60 years of India's democracy, we had taken a decoration journey by putting a Constitution on elephant back.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware of the Constitution and to make them interested in various sections of the Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we are going to complete 70 years and we will complete 75 years of our independence by 2022.
Come, let us all respect the value of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On 6th December, his Mahaparinirvana Day.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Babasaheb, who gave the right to save millions of Indians from respect.
The Republic was under the contemplation of Babasaheb and he used to say that Indias democratic ideals are not external.
The representatives of the Republic or the parliamentary system were nothing new for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he argued that we have achieved this freedom after a lot of freedom and that is why we have to protect it with the last point of blood.
He further said that no matter how much Indians have grown in different environments, the idea of the welfare of the country is always a priority.
Once again, I pay my respects to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev and will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev has always wished the welfare of humanity.
He has always shown the path of truth, work, service, compassion and goodwill to the society.
Our country will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in the next year, which will spread the country and spread all over the world.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this day with smoothness.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
A train will also be run in all the sacred places connected to Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara when I was talking about this.
The Gurudwara was severely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, but the way the state government revived the Gurudwara with the local people, it is commendable.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the passengers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat. I believe that I had the idea of Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
Our journey will continue.
This journey will be deeper and more satisfactory than I can get your support.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of people, what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that one thing has touched my heart in the footback of Mann Ki Baat, most of the people have said that when they listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme in the family, they feel that the lords of the family are sharing with them.
When I am glad to know that I am one of you, one of you, and you have made me big, I am very happy that I will come again and again through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your best wishes, my best wishes.
Come on, let's take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I want you all to participate in this race in a large number of unity.
About six and a half months before independence, the pictures of Sardar Patel were printed in the circumnavigation of the famous International Journal Time Magazine on 27 January, 1947.
The Time Service had given a design to India at his lead storey.
There were more than 550 territories.
Though the British intended to burst India, they wanted to dissolve this country.
The Time magazine has written that the dangers like separation, violence, food marketing, value addition and empowerment are in India, but if someone has the ability to bind the country in line with unity, then he was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so dangerous that you can solve it only.
Sardar Patel really took the path of solutions to a single problem and made it impossible to bind the entire country into unity.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Trivankur or Rajasthan's native states, Sardar Patel is the only person who has been able to see Akhand Bharat today in the skills of intellect and strategy.
This nation, tied to unity, is a reminder of the reverence of our Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is even more important because as a true tribute to him, we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation.
The statue on the banks of the river Narmada in Gujarat is double the height of the Statue of Liberty of America.
This will be the world's highest glittering architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the world's highest statue is now in India.
I believe that this special architecture will be known as a favorite vision across the country.
This is the day when the Indian Army personnel landed on Kashmir and protected the valley from the intruders.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great Indian soldier, Sam Manekesh.
Field Marshal Manekesh spoke at the time when he was a Colonel.
At that time, a military campaign started in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshal Manekesh said that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was in trouble at a meeting to delay sending troops to Kashmir and looked at Sardar Patel's habit and said that there will be no delay in the military operation in Kashmir and as soon as possible, the problem will be solved.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt.
I pay homage to the king.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc.
All these qualities are the measurement of the success of any player.
On the other hand, these four times are important for nation building.
These qualities among the youth of any country will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but will also hoist the flag of victory in the field of sports.
Recently, I had two meetings to remember.
First, I got the opportunity to meet Para Athletes participating in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
India has made a new record for 72 medals in this game and has increased the dignity of the country.
We won three more medals in Mix Event, in addition to 13 medals.
You must have remembered that this time the Asian Archives were also very good to show India.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best, the best word.
He's eight years old.
He spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
He cleaned DTC buses and worked on the roadside streams to run livestock after unemployment.
This narayan has won gold for India at the International event today.
Not only this, there is an extension of sports sector in India that such events like Judo, where India has not won any Olympic medal at the Universe or Senior Level, Tababi Devi Youth Olympics has made innovative history in Judo.
A sixteen-year-old girl lives in a village in Tawabi Devi Manipur.
His father sold a daylong and a mother's fish.
Sometimes there was a situation that they didn't have the meaning of buying food.
This kind of situation has also led to the inspiration of Tawabi Devi.
He created history for medals for the country.
There are many more such people, their lives are inspiring.
Every young player, their enthusiasm is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember, we have successfully organised FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has also been appreciated in the world's most successful editions.
FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPERCERD has broken the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh spectators have seen footwear in different stadiums of the country and have encouraged young players.
This time, India has achieved the opportunity of World Cup Hockey Organization in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves sports has a different place in his mind.
India has a golden history in the hockey game.
In the past, India won gold several times and once won the awards.
India has also presented many world class players in the hockey game.
Whenever there is talk of hockey in any place in the world, it remains incomplete.
Hockey's magician Maj Dhyanchad is recognized all over the world.
Besides, Balbir Singh Sinior, Leslie Cladies, Mohammad Saheed, Udham Singh and Dhanraj Pillai have brightened the name of India in the world.
Even today, the hockey players of Team India are making efforts and devotion for the success of the new generation.
Sports enthusiasts have a wonderful experience to sportspersons sitting in the stadium.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, not only the Indian team, but also all the countries will be encouraged.
The people of Orissa have a rich and cultural heritage of excellence and have to recall the spirit of inspiration.
Orissa is also a beautiful opportunity for sports lovers.
I convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are coming forward in the work of social service, they are doing volunteering, it is becoming an inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has also promised to learn Wheelchair basketball to play a basketball in Wheelchair.
Here's the mindset, that's self-confidence... that's the mission mode reaction.
There are no Indians who will not be proud to hear these things.
I am not ours, this idea will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was looking at your proposals on Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a very thrilling expression of Mr. Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov, Please talk about how India's tribe and its traditions become the best example of being united with nature.
How will we empower their heritage for sustainable development, there is a need to learn from them.
I express my gratitude to you for keeping such a thing in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter that I inspire us to look back to our glorious past and culture, today, the world, especially the western countries, are discussing the environmental conservation and looking for a new way for its balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far from this problem, but we have to undertake self-reliance to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship trees like Bat and Arjun with respect.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi society has shown us the way to protect the environment.
They're ready to give up their lives to preserve trees, but they're not ready to accept the loss of a tree.
The Mishmis of Arunachal enjoy their relationship with the tiger.
They call him their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is also seen as a protector of the forest.
The people of the Varli community of Maharashtra mean the tiger as a guest, and they have the prosperity of the tiger.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their fate is connected to the tiger and if the tiger does not have food, then the villagers will have to remain untouched.
The Gonda tribe of Middle India stops fishing at some places in the fertility season.
They say these places are the habitations of fishes, and they have abundance of fresh fish.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural materials, which are strong and environmentally friendly.
In South India, there is a small population in the remote areas of the Nilgiri Mountain, which is based on traditions, from locally available things.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that tribal communities believe in being peaceful and together, but whenever they harm their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, tribal communities were also.
Who can forget Lord Veersa Munda, who fought hard against the British rule to protect their forests.
There are many examples of the tribal community who teach us how to live with nature and for the forest wealth that is around us, our country is lending to the tribal community.
Come on, we pay homage to them.
My dear countrymen, at the Mann Ki Baat event, we talk about the problems of those people and those who are doing some good work for the society.
The work that seems to be normal, but it has a far-reaching impact on changing our mindset and determining the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was studying about Gurubachan Singh ji of Panjab.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to a common and labourer.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told Kan's parents that they would do this marriage.
Then he suddenly said he had a curse.
Nowadays, when she's supposed to be in marriage, she's going to talk about a big pun, so that the family of Kan's family will fall into difficulty.
But you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white-skirt farmer, he told Kann's father that it is the real strength of the society.
Guruvachan Singh ji said that you should talk to me, from now on, you will not be able to penetrate the residue that you will be after harvesting the crops in the field of agriculture.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden.
Gurubachan Singh ji feels very extraordinary, but by expressing this, his personality and we have seen that there are many families in our society who have converted personal things into good work in the society.
The family of Shri Guruvachan Singh ji had established a philosophy.
I read about another village in Punjab, Kallar, which is located near the navy.
Kaller Majra was in the clutches because the people there didn't burn the pulses of cereals and mixed it with the soil, and the technologies needed for it themselves.
I convey my best wishes to brother Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of those places who are trying their best to free the environment from pollution.
You all are taking the right path to a healthy lifestyle available in the Indian heritage.
Like the drops of water produced by the sea, such small awareness and emotional work always helps in creating a positive environment.
India has a special significance this year on November 11, as the first war ended a hundred years ago in November 11.
I mean, it will be a hundred years after the end of the terrible destruction and destruction.
The first war for India is an important event.
In fact, we had no connection with this great war.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country have fought with Bahaduri in this war, have played a big role and have made the highest sacrifices.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery in difficult conditions.
The only objective of this was to restore peace.
In the first war, the whole world looked at destruction.
It is estimated that about one crore soldiers and so many civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the whole world realized the importance of peace.
In the last 100 years, peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, the North-East has a specialty.
The natural beauty here is immense and the people here are also talented.
Our North-East is now known for the best and great work.
It's a place where bio farming has improved.
A few days ago, the honourable Future Policy Gold Award has won Sikkim for promoting sustainable food systems for long term food systems.
The award was awarded by the FAO Economic Food and Agricultural Organization, a United Nations Organisation.
You will be glad to know that the awards given for making the best policy in this specific sector are like Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won the awards by losing one and a half nominations in the country.
I thank the people of Sikkim for that.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is going to be over.
Monsoon changes are understanding.
The winter has come and with the change of weather, the season of the festival has also come, Dhanteras, Deepawali, Brotherhood and Chhat Puja can be said to be the month of November.
I convey my best wishes to every country for all the festivals.
I would like to urge you to take care of yourself during the festival, look at your health and look at the well-being of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The way you move, the country will move.
