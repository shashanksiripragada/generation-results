Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that only Indian society is participating in this.
Now many countries, the citizens and social movements of the country celebrate Deepawali with full joy and zeal.
It is also said that in a way India can be created there.
Friends, Festival tourism has become an attraction in the world.
There are immense potential for festival tourism.
Whatever our efforts are to be, we must celebrate Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu.
Various kinds of events are being organised in every state and every part of our country, in which people from other countries take more country.
Therefore, the participation of overseas Indians is very important in expanding the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different on this Deepavali or not.
We all had to celebrate this Deepawali on the occasion of this Deepawali, that is, we would respect the women of India and its achievements.
Within a few days, innumerable inspiring stories have come in the social media.
Millionaires of welcomed Ramesh ji said that his mother is his strength in the Namoop App.
In the 1990s, my father accepted the pledge to maintain five children at the time of time.
Today, we are sitting in good work with five brothers.
Ramesh ji, bow to your mother.
The next time, Geetika Swami, who is very enthusiastic in the Twitter, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the brothers of India.
In terms of poet Dwadi ji, his daughter is the daughter of India and he gives him strength.
The mother is very proud of her daughter's paintings.
He has also received good values in the entrance election of CLAT.
People are sharing such information.
You must read, see, inspire, and share something around you like those who are present in it. I salute all these women of India on this occasion.
We see that he had laid the foundation stone of this thing in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November this year, Sri Guru Nanak Dev jis 550th birth anniversary will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev ji is spread not only in India but all over the world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are living in many countries of the world, they are fully dedicated to Guru Nanak Dev ji's high objectives.
I have never forgotten that I went to the Gurudwaras in Venkuwar and Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has to share a lot of things about them, but many parts of the Mann Ki Baat will be fully needed.
Nanak Dev ji was considered to be the best of all.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the service of selflessness was invaluable.
He made a strong voice against social evils such as Dindami.
The news of Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji spread all over the world.
He was one of those who traveled a lot during his time.
He will travel to many places, wherever he goes, through his simplicity and work, he will win the minds of all.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had visited several important religious places which are called Udasi.
He took the message of harmony and equality from north to south, from east to west, from all directions to people from all over the country, to sovereign and sacred.
It is believed that Shankardev ji, a well-known pilgrim of Assam, had also been inspired by him.
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara, a pilgrimage of Kashi.
He has also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya related to Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water conservation there during his visit to Karnataka's fears.
It reminds us of the dedication of a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bihar.
Guru Nanak ji travelled in the north, Kashmir and its neighbourhood.
This led to a strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet and people from there accepted him as Guru.
He also salutes Uzbekistan for his pilgrimage.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited largely Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took place in the minds of millions of people, they followed his teachings with full fervour and followed him even today.
Just a few days ago, government ambassadors from around 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Arunachal Pradesh.
They visited the Golden Jubilee and all this happened on the occasion of Guru Nanak Dev ji's 550th birth anniversary.
This day, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was the iron man of India and he was the supreme leader of the country.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful capability to integrate the people, while there was a power to enhance compliance with those who had differences.
He's really equal to seeing Man of Detail, the skull.
Besides, there are expertise in organisational activities.
The art of making plans and making strategies is his handicraft.
When we read about Sardar ji's work, we know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of delegates were coming from all over the country to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements of the conference were imposed on Sardar ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the water network of the city.
He ensured that nobody should have water conservation.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to make Khadrab bags.
At the same time, a significant increase in cash sales was also ensured.
Our country would have been grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He was of great significance to determine fundamental rights, which has no place for any upheaval on the basis of caste and religion.
Friends, as the first interior minister of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji succeeded in integrating the slopes, rolling the gold in the slopes of a large, history.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we only talk about his contribution to certain areas of integration of the country.
Just as Sardar Patel reached them, he did not delay for a second, but immediately descended into a serious action.
According to his order, three hundred rupees were immediately flew, while watching, the opponent's evil desire to capture the Lakshadweep was poured down.
After this incident, Sardar Patel ji asked brothers to ensure that all the assistance required for the development of Lakshadweep is provided.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the statue of unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to mark the memorial of Sardar Veda.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a two-page statue of freedom goddess in the United States.
Every Indian is proud of being the highest statue in the world.
Every Indian's head is proud.
I am very happy that in one year, more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity.
As such, 8500 people have visited the glory of the idol of unity every day.
It seems that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has expressed his faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Sapta Gardens, Bamboo Gardens, Wildlife Sanctuary, Child Nutrition Parks, Unity Nursery, which have led to the development of the economy of the region and provide new employment opportunities to the people.
Friends, For all the states, for tourism, this unity statue can be a testimony.
We are all witnesses to how one place can become a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There are people from our country and those from abroad.
Several such organizations are developing one by another, transport, housing, guides and environment friendly organizations.
And I urge you too, to distribute your precious time, and to see the statue of unity
But at the same time, every Indian who travels, visits at least 15 places in India with his family, stay there at night, I urge you to reiterate my request.
Friends, You must be aware that from 2014 to October 31, we are celebrating the country's unity day.
On this day, we have the message of saving our country's unity, integrity and security.
On 31st October, as per the year, a mode of unity is being organised.
In this, all sections of society and all sections of society will be present.
In this way, this movement is being carried out not only for the body but also for the inner and friendly, but also for the unity of India and for India to reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel ji had linked the country to unity.
This mantra of unity is like a magnificence in our lives, in a diversified country like India, we must continue to consolidate this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very positive and aware to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we surround us, many examples of those engaged in sustainable operations to promote mutual harmony will be seen.
But perhaps, the efforts of the society, its contribution, disappears from the memorial at a rapid pace.
Friends, I remember that in the month of September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ramjan Bhumi.
But as soon as the decision was taken, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions, sages and ancestors expressed very peaceful and intermediate views.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
On that day, those moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of the solidarity that gives strength to the nation.
Even Gods who have experienced the benefits, 125 crore Indians are themselves.
But there is a pleasant experience and interesting experience.
I heard, why shouldn't I share with you
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature was 50-60 degrees below the pooja.
Life in the air is only in some name.
In such a opposite situation, living in the middle of such challenges is no less than a superficial act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries but also conducting a Swachh Siachen movement.
I express my gratitude and appreciation to the people of the country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to die in the severe cold there.
In such a situation, all the important tasks are to distribute huts and organise it.
If there is an environment here, it is the life of rare animals like ice glacier, here are rare animals like iPex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, celebrations are not time to create a new awareness in all of us.
Moreover, on Deepawali, especially for buying something new and bringing something from the market is happening in every family.
I had once said that we should try to buy local goods.
What is the need to go to the regional level if we get the right thing in our village
What is the need to go to the district level if one thing is available at the regional level
The more we are trying to buy the locally available products, Gandhi himself will grow to a great opportunity.
I reiterate my request to buy something in the dressed clothes of our neighbours, and in the manufacturers of our neighbours.
Deepawali also conveys its best wishes and I urge you to turn ourselves into people who want to buy more local goods.
Through this, we must show how important we can contribute to fulfilling the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you all for this Deepavali.
On the day of Deepavali, we slaughter a variety of bats.
However, sometimes our attention gets burnt due to lack of attention.
It's wounded.
Therefore keep yourselves safe, while I urge you to celebrate festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
Our soldiers are always ready to express their happiness and express their support.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the victory celebrations of Parakram Parva.
We remembered the precise attack in 2016, and our soldiers responded strongly to the hiding war that had been demanded in the radical war on our country.
Our soldiers had organised exhibitions at various places in the country to indicate what our strength is for the citizens of the country, especially the youth.
See how talent we are, how our soldiers are protecting our country by paying their lives.
One day like Parakram Parva reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our soldiers.
It also encourages us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a brave event in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is now decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development environment of our country, our soldiers will give them a strong answer.
India has always given its commitment to maintain peace and has been dedicated to the spirit of dedication.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their biggest sacrifice for peace, even in those wars we have no connection.
This is also a mighty act of understanding by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmets for years and have played an important role in sustaining peace in the world.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
In this way, it is no wonder that the Indian Air Force is attracting the attention of every Indian by expressing its power in the sky.
They have given us a security feeling.
On the occasion of the Freedom Day celebrations, one of the hopes of the people with keen desire and willingness towards the mobilisation, in which our Air Force will demonstrate their strengths with the acts of depression.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
In the year 1932, our Air Force, which started a small scale with 6 aircrafts and 19 aircrafts, today has become one of the most brave and powerful Air Forces of the 21st century.
I extend my warm greetings to all the Air Force personnel and their families who have served for the country.
In the year 1947, when Pakistanis attacked unnecessaryly, our Air Force decided to save Sri City from attackers, landing the arms and warfields of Indian soldiers at the right time.
The Air Force responded strongly to the opponents in 1965.
Who will be unaware of the 1971 freedom struggle
In Tiger Hill, all the opponents were hiding in the area of Tiger Hill and rained in the night and cast their soil.
The country is grateful to the Air Force for the memorable activities of our Air Force personnel, be it relief and relief operations or disaster arrangements.
Their feelings are unparalleled to tackle all disasters ranging from the wind, sunlight to floods and forest lakes and help the nation.
The Air Force has taken a step in creating gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of every department for women.
Now I have made an announcement on 15th August this year from the Red Fort that women will be able to join the Air Force and sustainable work with short-term work.
Honourable Bong can tell us that the contribution of women's power is increasing not only to the soldiers of the Indian Army but also to the same extent.
Women are empowered, but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, Abilash Tommy, a naval officer in the past, had faced a struggle to die.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to travel on a small boat without any modern technology help and travel to the world.
For the past 80 days, he was moving ahead without reducing his speed in the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.
He was a magnificent example of courage, desperation and magnificence, a few days ago, when he brought the aspiration out of the sea, I spoke to him on the telephone.
I have already met Tommy.
I pray for Abhilash Tommy's excellent health, his bravery, his integrity, his motivation, his fighting power will surely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country will be aware of the importance of our country on 2nd October.
There is another significance this year on 2nd October.
This year, we are organizing several events all over the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Gandhiji's ideas have inspired the whole world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important act of bowing with the people of the country.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
He then prepared a copies of those ideas when the freedom struggle was intensified in 1945.
He expressed his views on various issues such as safety, cleanliness and extension of education, the rights of bowels, farmers, villages and workers.
It is also called Gandhi charter.
Everyone has experienced this in the most special form of his personality.
He gave everybody the feeling of being very important and unnecessary for the country.
This has been transformed into a widespread people's struggle, which is his biggest contribution in the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, Gandhiji's chariots and all sections of the society brought themselves forward and engaged themselves.
Ask your mind that whenever I give you a safeguard, whenever you feel embarrassed, accept this measure - whoever is very poor and weak, look at that person, remember his face, listen to your mind, listen to what kind of action you are going to do to that person.
This will brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this safeguard of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power and their purchasing power.
Can we remember the oil for a week when we go to buy something
Can you remember that kitchen
Whose face is pleasant
If you buy, someone will get a goodbye directly or indirect
If this benefits the poor and the poor, then my happiness will be doubled.
Keep in mind this mantra of Gandhiji, when we all buy something in the days to come, when we buy every thing on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, remember that somebody of our country should do good, especially those who have sweat and those who have invested their money in it, those who have sown their capabilities should get some benefits.
He might have been unaware of how it would happen, but this happened, India got freedom.
Today, we can see how this small work can contribute to the economic development of my country, in the contribution of economic power and the power to fight against poverty.
But today, I believe that this is the real patriotic patriot, this will be a sacrifice that we can give to ourselves.
He said that all these doors are greying with great comfort and every household should be used.
And it came to pass, that, behold, there was a serpent in the land, and a snare in the people of the land, and in every serpent of the serpent that had a small image.
We are going to celebrate Shastri ji's birth anniversary two days later.
Their anger, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, is the symbol of his emotional personality.
As a result of his unhealthy commitment towards the country, he was able to give the mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country at a short span of about one and a half years.
Millions of people connected themselves in this movement and I got the opportunity to serve with Ambedkar School children of Delhi in Swachhta.
Baba Saheb, who had laid the foundation stone for that school.
All kinds of people from all over the country were engaged in this service on 15th.
The organisations also contributed with great enthusiasm.
School children, college students, national student soldiers, national welfare programmes, youth organisations, media groups and corporations, all have served in a big way.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those people who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Come on, let's hear a phone call.
But if you weren't able to telephone the way it was a pretext for you after the toilets, the attention of the people associated with this movement would have been unable to get a smooth eye.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world.
This time, India is organizing the world's largest Swachh Sammelan in an unprecedented manner.
At the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and sectoral experts from all over the world share their exams and experiences on cleanliness.
The completion of the Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention will be held on 2nd October this year on the commencement of 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
In the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar, there are many insistences on protecting the basic rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993, inspired by the vision.
The Commission will be constituted and completed in a few days of 25 years.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also improving human dignity.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji and human rights are not our foreign principles.
The principle that has come from the Vedic times has been written in the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission:
The Commission has created widespread awareness on human rights and has contributed to preventing its misuse.
This 25-year journey has created a hopeful and trusted environment for the people of the country.
It provides a healthy society with a reliance on special democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also running along with the work of human rights at the national level.
As a society, we need to understand the significance of human rights and follow it in practice.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, the birth centenary of Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmatha Vijayraje Scindia ji will begin.
All these people have been inspiring us, let us remember them.
On 31st October, when Sardar ji's birth anniversary comes, I will speak in detail in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, but why do I want to tell him today, for a few years, on 31st October, a settlement for unity is being organised in every small city, every village in India.
This year, we have to make efforts to organise this drive for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
Sardar ji's journey to unity is the best way to think of them as he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you that on 31st October, through the drive of unity, we must give strength to our efforts to unite every section of society and every section of the country with the help of unity, this will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today Raksha Bandhan is celebrated all over the country.
My best wishes to all the people of the country on this holy day.
Raksha Bandhan has shown love and trust between brother and sister.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are many special stories associated with the faith of the people of two different parts or religions in the history of the country.
A few days later, Genmashtami is going to be celebrated.
The elephant, horse, horse, teeth, Jai Kanhaiyalal ki, Govinda-Govinda are shouting all over the atmosphere.
The joy in Sri Krishna's devotion is very different.
In many parts of the country, especially in the state of Maharashtra, our youth will be making preparations for Dhahi-Handi.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the country for Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartfelt gratitude to sister Sinmai for presenting a special thing.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, we celebrate the Sanskrit Day on the occasion of Siravan Purnima.
I extend my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bringing this great treasure to the people of Meruguti.
Every language has a significance.
India is proud of Tamil language as the oldest language in the world
Similarly, it is a matter of great pride for all of us that since the time of Vedic times, till date, the culture language has been playing a big role in spreading knowledge.
In every field of life, the genius of wisdom is buried in the language and its literature.
Be it science, technology, agriculture, well-being, heavens, architecture, management, economic or environment...
You all will be happy to know that the people of Matur village of Shimoka district of Karnataka are still using culture as a case language.
There are possibilities of creating numerous words of the society and sufficient words of suffix and society, i.e., prefix, 22 percent.
Therefore, any subtle feeling or thing can be described in accurate manner.
We always remember Sarvapali Radhakrishnan.
On his birth anniversary, we celebrate Teachers Day all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I congratulate the spirit of dedication to the teachers in science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought the expectations of our farmers working hard.
In some places, the condition of rains has become more than other places.
We all saw how bad the lives of the people were affected by the severe floods in Kerala.
Though we cannot fulfil their grief, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this moment of sadness.
I pray that those injured in this natural catastrophe should recover quickly.
Everybody decides how to reduce the lives of the people of Kerala, how to share their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of rescue operations in Kerala.
They have left no effort to save the civilians in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Air Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries, Defence Force and Accessories are all playing a major role in this movement.
In particular, I would like to mention the hard work of the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF).
Tomorrow, the Oan Festival has been celebrated, we all want to give strength to the nation, especially Kerala, to get up from the impact of this disaster and to make the development journey of Kerala faster.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters that the entire country is close to you and helps you in this trouble.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see what the people of the country have written more about. It is Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji's beloved for us.
Kirti of Kaziaabad, Swati Vatsa from Sonib, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and MyGov, have been asking the Prime Minister about the diversity of Atal ji's life.
On August 16, the country and the world were saddened by Atal ji's timely news.
14 years ago, he opened the post of Prime Minister.
In a way, he has been away from a serious politics for the past decades.
He didn't get a place in the news, he was away from public life.
The nation and the world have seen that this decade has not made any difference in the minds of the common Indians since August 16.
Atal ji's love, embarrassment and sorrow have enhanced in the country, which demonstrates his great personality.
Over the past few days, Atal ji's best miracles have emerged before the country.
People recall him as the best parliamentarian, the best speaker, the Prime Minister of the people's heart, and recall.
Atal ji will always be grateful to the nation for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today, I want to tell you about another dimension of Atal ji's broader governance, to touch it, the political culture that Atal ji has given to India, the effort to transform it and the vision to make it systematic will be very beneficial in the days to come.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st political amendment made in 2003.
This change has led to two important changes in the politics of India.
First, the number of state ministers should be only 15 percent of the total number of members of the legislature.
Secondly, according to the law against party, the quantity of one-third of the previous members increased to two-thirds members.
Besides, there were clear norms to ensure the membership of the party's party members.
For decades, the political culture that set up large-scale cabinets in India has been established, and these big cabinets have been maintained not to share work, but political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Because of his activity, money and expenditure were saved.
Moreover, there was a progress in the performance.
This is possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and a healthy heritage has begun to live in our political culture.
Atal ji is a true patriot.
During his tenure, the budget was changed while submitting the budget.
Earlier, according to the British method, the budget was submitted at 5 pm.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time to submit the budget from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Likewise, you people are watching the discussions on conducting elections at the same time to the central government and the state governments in the country.
On this occasion, when we assure him of fulfilling his dream of a sufficient and developmental India, I dedicate to All of us on behalf of Atal ji.
When there is talk of parliament, they are spoken of shouting, shouting and shouting, but if something good happens, they don't speak much.
A few days ago, the rainy season meeting of the Parliament was completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and the productivity of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
All parliamentarians attempted to make the monsoon session more profitable, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The rainy season of both of them will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
During the meeting, many important bills were passed for the benefit of youth and backward classes.
This move will help in achieving the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed.
The Act will further protect the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover, it will prevent the atrocities of the criminals and rely on the minds of the underprivileged.
No civil society can tolerate the injustice that is being exploited against women's power.
The country is not ready to tolerate those who are engaged in sexual abuse
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Amendment Bill and guided the rigorous punishment.
A court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, you may have read a few days ago, asking for a case within two months and punishing two criminals who have been accused of sexually assaulting the girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the investigation in just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
Even in Rajasthan, courts have quickly given judgments in such cases.
The Act will boost the prevention of crimes committed against women and girls.
We can transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged.
This time, in the rainy season, all together have created a unique model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions of people has been on the Asian Sports Competitions in Jarta.
Every day, to see people on newspapers, televisions and news, first on social websites, which Indian soldier has won the medal.
Asian Sports Competitions are now underway.
I would like to congratulate all sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons who are participating in the competition.
Indias sportspersons have achieved great achievements, especially in the shooting competition and the Malaysia competition, but our sportspersons are getting medals even in the unprecedented sectors such as Wushu competition and boating.
These are not medals, but the evidence of the hopes and dreams of Indian sports and sportspersons...
Our women are also present in the growing number of medals for the country, which is a very positive sign.
As far as the medal winners are concerned, our youngsters from 15-16 years of age will also be included.
My best wishes to all on the occasion of National Sports Day.
We all have seen the construction of houses and buildings with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that a large mountain has been carved in a very specific, broad and magnificent temple of a single rock.
India's land has been an engineering testing ground.
Many engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved imagination and have given examples that are known as miracles in the engineering world.
Even today, lakhs of farmers and the common people are benefitting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the banks of the river Ganga.
He has been a devotee of all these parts of the country and the country is also bravely honouring him.
In his memory, we are following on September 15 as engineers day.
On the path shown by him, the engineers of our country have placed a different picture all over the world.
When we talk about the miracles of the engineering world, there was an incident in 2001 when there was a horrific earthquake in Kutch, Gujarat.
When I was working as a self-sufficient man, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I had to meet a grandmother of 100 years old.
He was calling me, calling me a park in Par-Kutch.
He further said that this house has seen 3 earthquakes.
I have met 3 earthquakes.
I understand them at the same house.
But there is no harm anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had built buildings in accordance with regional ecosystems, so that the people could live safely.
We must think of the future when we commemorate the Engineers' Day today.
The world is suffering from natural disasters.
As we have met in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, we are talking openly, we will take the country forward through our minds, we will be united.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, bow down.
Although India's vastness and diversity are on one side, sometimes the rain also shows its distinction.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, sometimes nature expresses its anger.
Therefore, we have to be nature-loving, protecting nature, conserving nature, we have to be responsible for ourselves.
A few days ago, a natural disaster attracted the attention of the whole world and boiled human society.
It takes usually a few hours to enter the cave and come out.
But on that day the sports of the law was different.
After they went far inside the cave, due to the sudden unrest, the cave's entrance was substantially stagnant.
They were shut down the way out.
And they dwelt on a small rock within the cave for no way, neither for two days, nor for 18 days.
Just imagine how the youngsters have to spend every week when they don't die in front of the eyes
On the one hand, they were stuck in the larger area, on the other hand, the entire human society was uniting and expressing the humanity that God has given.
People from all over the world were praying to bring these children out safely.
Neither shall the parents be sorry nor shall the tears grow in the eyes of the mother
The boys were surprised to see that they were not supposed to lose their confidence, while they showed so much courage and consciousness in a blind cave full of water.
This event shows us that when human society stands together, there are wonders.
But we need to keep the goal of being peaceful and stable and do not work for it.
Just a few days ago, the dear poet of our country, Nawaj ji, left us all.
He has a special significance - belief, self-confidence and stress.
The months of July-August are very important for the farmers and all the youth.
Because these months they are the highest seasons of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam get out of school and join colleges.
If the months of February-March are for examinations, hearings and answers, the months of April-May are enjoying vacations and deciding which work should be done.
In the month of July, the youth's colony goes away from questions and goes to cut-off evaluations, which is an important time.
The attention of the students goes away from the house and goes to the school.
Students get away from the umbrella of parents and join them under the umbrella of professors.
I am fully confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting a college life.
For the first time, it will come out of the house and leave the village and get out of a safe environment and start driving itself.
These youngsters have left their homes for the first time and have come out to set a new direction for their lives.
Many students will be present in their colleges, some will be going to join.
If I want to tell you, be quiet, experience your innermostness in life, there is no doubt that it is important to read books and also make yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There is a special value for old friends.
Young friends are very valuable, while selecting new friends, behaviour and maintaining friendship is a very intelligent step.
You can learn some new things, some new capabilities, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new lap.
While talking about college climate, it was reported that ASHARAM Sautri, a student from the poorest family in Madhya Pradesh, has achieved success through the difficult challenges of life.
He has been elected as the first step in the hospital's medical care examination in Jodhpur AIIMS (AIMS).
His father is working as a sanitation worker and maintaining his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
The students of such a poor family have achieved their unprecedented endeavour and drive toward the worst conditions.
Their achievements give us the imagination that Kushi's father is a driver in the school bus, Karthik's father is a policeman from Haryana, Ramesh Sahu's father of Jharkhand is working on brass shovel.
Likewise, Anushka Banda, a disabled woman from Gudka, suffered from a spinal muscular atrophy from birth...
All of them, with the help of pessimism, have broken the obstacles in the minds of faith and have achieved the world's return.
If we roam around us, we will know many such examples.
Whatever good thing happens in any corner of the country, it fills my mind, inspires me
When you talk about such youths, I am taking care of them, this is the meaning of life.
I want to hear the poetry taxes of Najaj ji. I want to hear the songs of the earth. I want to call the two to light. I want to remove the tyranny from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a message and two youths fulfilled Modi's dream.
While reading this in detail, it was realized how our youth are trying to transform the lives of the common man by using technology intellectually and creatively.
Once I had been interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, known as Technical Centre.
I urge them to think about how they can use their capabilities for India.
I urge you to come out of foreign countries and how to use it to the motherland.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, took this challenge and took a new initiative.
Yogesh ji and Rajnish ji used their entrepreneurship skills to create a Smart Gaon App and intellectual villages.
This app connects the villagers to the world and provides a way to get any information and information in their mobile phones.
Representatives of Rae Bareli, Chairperson of Panchayat, District Judges and District Governants were all aware of the use of this app.
If you look at this event, we must remember that these youths are living in the United States and living there in the midst of lifestyle and thoughts, even though they left India several years ago, they have been smoothly aware of their villages, understanding the challenges and connecting with their villages.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the needs of the village properly and act accordingly.
The thirst is natural for every Indian to gain something from his village and his roots, for his mother's country.
But sometimes, due to the compulsions of the time, the hurricanes and conditions, this feeling is slightly shrinking and dragging them towards the days that have passed.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Around 15-20 days before Adi Ekadash, Varkari i.e. travellers are walking with their teeth for a sacred journey to Bandarpur.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Tukkaram Swamis are walking towards Bandarpur while singing, singing, singing, singing, singing, singing and singing.
The pilgrimage is called Vitoba or Bandurangan and they come there to visit the Lord.
Lord Vittal is the protector of the interests of the poor, the deprived and the suffering.
The devotees of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with satisfaction and devotion.
Going to the Vitopa Temple of Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all unique experiences.
I urge the leaders of Mann Ki Baat that once you get the opportunity, you can experience the Bandarpur Wari.
Innumerable Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas Swamis and Dukaram Swamis are still being guided by the people of Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against blindness and the heritage of these greats is inspiring every corner of India.
Whether it is a song or a song, we have a great news of the importance of harmony, harmony and brotherhood.
As the great heritage of the great people who sacrificed their lives on the footsteps of the Lord was in our country, there were also great men who dedicated themselves to the mother of India, and they showed their lives to her.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has put an impression in the minds of many Indians.
On 23rd July, while we celebrate the birth anniversary of Tilak, we celebrate his memories on 1st August.
The LORD is full of courage and self-confidence.
The power and integrity of the British rulers were filled with direct demonstration of the mistakes.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very attracted by the local people.
On August 1, 1920, when Lakmanya Tilak was lost, she promised to build a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately chose Victoria Garden, in the name of the UK ueen, to recall the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Accordingly, the British discovered this act, so the ruler refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that while addressing the opening ceremony, Gandhiji said that after assuming the office of Sardar Patel, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only received a good man, but also got a balcony, which has led to the establishment of a statue of Tilkar.
My dear countrymen, the significance of this magnitude is that this magnificent magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificence of the magnificent magnificent magnificent magnificent magni
I am sharing with you only about the years of the British.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating the Ganesh festival on a social basis.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history can be understood from this fact that even today our young society is very attractive.
Today, we can see the bonds of worshipping the hero in almost all streets of many cities.
I would like to have a broader campaign on the NarendraModiApp and MyGov and NarendraModiApp to honour the festival of Honourable Ganesha on the occasion of the Ecosystem in every city.
I will definitely take your ideas to the people.
Every Indian has to reach goodwill and goodwill of development.
This will create a New India.
Tilakar was born 50 years later on the same day i.e. on 23rd July, another son of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the people of the country to breathe free air.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
Any young man of India will be inspired by these words: "Parti thirst lies in our hearts, let us see the power of the opponents, and these poem taxes are envisaged to many youngsters like Ashfakulla Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's demise, his commitment to freedom, inspired many youngsters.
Azad ji paid his life, but he did not bow down to the foreign rule.
I had a great deal of visiting Alirajpur, the village of Chandrasekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I demonstrate my memories with Saram to these two great sons of Mother India - Lakmanya Tilak and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, India's homeland and the farmer's daughter, won a gold medal at the 400-meter run in the World Wars Championships held in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman from the country, has written my letter through email from Indonesia and is now ready for Asian sports competitions.
"I am very proud that once there is a very important feeling in the life of the brave person, it is to hold a three-pronged flag on the global stage, I have done it.
Ekta, we're all proud of you.
You are proud of the nation.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix 2018, the world-wide Gold and Bronze Medal for Persons with Disabilities.
His achievement is that he made the challenge of transformation as a means of success.
Due to the road accident in 2003, Ekta Bayan had lost his limbs under his body, but he did not lose his chest, strengthened himself and achieved the goal of counting.
Another handicapped person, Yogesh Kadunia, has won the gold medal in Grand Free in Berlin, and Sunder Singh Gurjar, along with him, won the Gold Medal in Berlin.
I convey my best wishes to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kadunia ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and inadequate thirst.
You have to move further, play and enjoy.
My dear countrymen, there are many events and celebrations of history in August, but sometimes the diseases are also placed at home due to the climate.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for your special health and for this month of August and for the centuries of the celebrations that have been guided.
We must meet again in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket crash in Bangalore.
You all are aware that I am telling you about the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of great pride for every Indian that this is the first international test partnership of Afghanistan and the historic test partnership of Afghanistan with India.
The President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Khani, who had performed well in the competition, also made me a tank and said in the Twitter, "Afghan people are proud of their hero Rashid Khan."
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for setting up a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This flame will be unforgettable for everyone.
For the first time, it is memorable, but for another reason, I consider it a special thing.
The Indian team has shown an exemplary exhibition all over the world.
We can understand the quality of sportspersons from this event.
This shows that sports is an incredible way to connect the world and to showcase the capabilities and capabilities of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that in the future, we will play with each other and we will be able to grow.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrate the 4th International Day of Yoga on 21st June, the entire world was associated with it.
I am told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga was held, in which women had performed a large number of asanas.
In Ladakh's highest peaks, India and China's army personnel joined together in yoga.
Some soldiers also performed yoga in the ship.
Likewise, some soldiers took yoga on the snowy peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force performed yoga at a height of 15,000 feet in the middle of the earth and inspired everyone.
It is worth mentioning that they did not do this as they sat on the plane, and did it as they floated in heaven.
Yoga has been trained everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There, about 750 disabled brothers and sisters were grouped together and became world-class by doing yoga.
Without any control of caste, time and geographical definition, we have been living for centuries, with the feeling of compassionate family and individuality of the world.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
Whenever there is trouble, we remember the doctors
But on this day we celebrate the services of doctors, the feeling of dedication and achievements, I thank them.
The doctors of our country have put their marks all over the world because of their capabilities.
While our doctors are skilled and hardworking in the medical industry, our doctors are also renowned in solving complex medical problems.
India is a rich historical country that does not have a day or a month or a historic event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabir Dasar went to Makhar.
Pilgrim Kabir Dasar pressured social unity, peace and brotherhood through the poetry forms of his poets and poems.
This was his goal.
This is what we see in his creations and this is the same vision in today's world.
Behold, listen to one of his domains - Kabir Soibir Hai, Jo Joe Jane Ber Beer, Joe Bir Na Janahei, So Ka Bir Men Beer.
Kabir Das has given special pressure on social harmony.
What does he say in another Toha...
There is sin where there is greatness and blackness.
He added, Jati Nu Buchso Sathu Gi, Buch Leezi.
Do not ask the saints what their tribe is, and seek wisdom from them.
He urged the people to accept and respect the people with their wisdom on the occasion of caste.
His ideas are still affecting centuries later.
Guru Nanak Dev ji- the service to the poor and the needy is the obligation of God.
And wherever he goes, there is a lot of socio-economic support.
Guru Nanak Dev ji introduced the cooking system of Langar.
Guru Nanak Dev jis 550th birth anniversary is going to be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and zeal.
India's freedom struggle is very long, broad, deep and many sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 will take 100 years, which is a demand for shameful humanity.
My heartbreaking countrymen, Raman Kumar ji from Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all I thank you.
I am glad to see your interest in India's decline.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the day of time, that is, on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
It is also known to some people that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was addressing the grave gathering of Calcutta University in Bengal.
It is notable that this was the first time the British had addressed the graduation of the University of Calcutta in Bengal.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the first industrial minister of India and even more, he laid the foundation stone for India's industrial development and founded a strong foundation stone, it was not surprising.
His ideas and visions were unprecedented in the first industrial policy of India's independence in 1948.
Dr.
Mukherjee jis dream is to make India self-sufficient and self-sufficient in every sector.
While India is developing big businesses, he wanted to pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, weights and migrations.
During the period 1948 to 1950, he built all the handicrafts boards, all handlooms boards, doors and rural industries boards to provide financial and institutional platforms for the overall development of small and medium enterprises.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee jis contribution.
He was a part of the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellect and creative activity, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video conference.
Going beyond the curves, I had the opportunity to learn from them directly about the changes in life.
When an ordinary man was aware... his simple words, his experience language, his event, as if he were looking at the mind.
Women from far-flung villages are providing services from pension to passport to senior citizens in villages through the Public Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister is collecting sweet potatoes and selling ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash from Jharkhand, millions of youth of the country are walking medicines and providing affordable medicines to the nearby villages.
Children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management at the Tinkering Lab in school since their childhood.
I have heard about the success of the ordinary people, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of New India, the power of the spirit of New India, more than the success of the government.
On the contrary, there are some people in the society - unless they speak of disappointment, unless they do not inspire inability, unless they seek the path of indifference, they are not peaceful.
In such a situation, I don't consider it as a success to the government when the common man speaks of the events in his life with a new hope and a new enthusiasm.
The story of a small woman from a far-flung village turns into an inspiration for 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people connected this video bridge through the programme and you have done the job of providing me a new energy.
Once again, I would like to thank you all.
If we have seen us around, I have always seen that some good thing will certainly be in our eyes.
There are people who do good.
We can smell the smell of good.
One thing has attracted my attention in the past, which is a very terrible link.
On the one hand there are industrialists and engineers, while on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters working on land.
The peasants have added to it, have laid down projects, have made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Scientists and engineers have trained the farmers through this trust to learn new methods of agriculture and how to do organic farming, how to harvest one thousand other crops in the fields.
Today they have not only done vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through this Trust and selling them at a good price, even the farmers who produce grains are connected to it.
I am happy to know that these youngsters associated with the world of industrialists, engineers and technologists have left their circles and have made their way to work together with the farmers, connecting them with the villages and collaborating with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your young man is actually envisaging any young man.
Other youth of the country will definitely go to their website and take care of their work and they will also be inspired about how they can work in different sectors of the society.
It is a dream for all the people of the country that one country is one tax.
If someone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax revision then I would like to congratulate the states as I am.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been organised, involving a variety of political ideas, participating in various states, participating in different priorities
Before implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but now the same tax is being changed.
The success of the GST currency is an organisation of currency measures.
As soon as the checkpoints have come to an end, the freight transport is going on at a rapid pace, the time will be left and there is considerable profits in the goods service sector.
The world's largest tax revision.
Normally, when such a great reform, such a big country, it was considered that it could take 5 to 7 years to stand completely.
This is the biggest success that 125 crore people have achieved this success.
Best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Come on, bow.
With the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to meet you all again.
I would like to remember all of you that a team of 6 female commanders of the Indian ship had visited the sea for months.
They have travelled in different oceans and many oceans and crossed around 22,000 oceans.
This is the first such journey in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate them for their excellent activity of enhancing their courage and pride of the naval and the glory of the country, especially the women of India, who have not laid down anybody in the world.
Nobody knows the spirit of adventure.
For centuries, the Everest Summit has been a challenge to humanity, and the destitute have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Truve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Matvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam, have climbed the highest peak of the world.
These students of Ashram School started their training in August 2017 and were trained at Warda, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were selected under the training programme of Shaurya Mission
They enjoyed the pride of the nation at the Everest Summit in accordance with the name.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the students and my young friends of Chandrapur School.
Accordingly, a 16-year-old woman from India, Shewangi Pathak, was the youngest Indian to reach Everest peak from Nepal.
Congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya and the first father and daughter of India will join the Everest Summit.
It is not that some youths are climbing the Everest peak.
On May 19, more than 50 years of age, Sangeeta Behl ji climbed the Everest Summit.
Some of those who climb the Everest summit show that they have skills and feelings.
In the past, the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, according to the Swachh Ganga Mission, a group of police officers crossed the Everest peak, but when they came down, they brought the unified pulses with their hand.
It is a matter of appreciation, while this shows their symptoms on the environment for cleanliness.
For years, people have climbed the Everest summit and many of them have won.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the brave soldiers, especially to women.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, when I had spoken about Fit India two months ago, I could not imagine that there will be so many answers.
It has not been seen that all sections of the country will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that as much as we are playing in sports, the country will also be involved in sports.
In social media, people are sharing physics related to fitness challenge i.e. physical challenges, and tackling each other's challenges.
Today, everyone is collaborating with this mission called Fit India.
Whether they are filmmakers or sportspersons, be it the common man of the country, be it soldiers, be it school teachers, India is committed everywhere.
I believe that this kind of challenge helps us to keep ourselves sustainable, and encourages others to enhance their sex.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you for your telephone call.
It is true that the sports playing on the streets were part of the lives of every child.
It may be said that these sports have been an important part of summer holidays.
At the time of graduation, after dinner, children play for hours without any concern or concern
In some of these sports, the entire family was participating and playing.
Several sports like kitchen, bamboo, kali, icebai, thritton police, kanamoochi, ko-ko were part of the sports from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kathch to Kamrup.
Yes, they may have been known by different names at different places.
For example, this game, known as 7 Stones, is known as Lahori, Pittu, Sadolia, Dikori and Sadodiya.
In these sports, we will see unity and unity in the backdrop of the diversity of our country.
One sports is known in different places and in different names.
I am from Gujarat and I know about a game called Somal-Isdo.
It is played in 8  8 square square balloons with a burglary or limestone.
This was played in almost all the states.
It is called Saukapara in Karnataka and Athu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called in Kerala, Sampal in Maharashtra, Tayam in Tamil Nadu and Sangabo in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language, but after playing, I came to know that we have played it too.
Is there any of us who don't play the kitchen, don't hesitate
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
It is called Kotibilla or Karrabilla in Andhra, Kulibadi in Odisha and Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
When all winds blow, when everyone plays, we can display the unique qualities that we have.
You can see that many children are sorry, but while playing, they will become very active.
They express themselves, and appear deeply, and blindness appears in them.
To determine the goal, how to reach the mindset, how to create the spirit of the group, how to create mutually beneficial.
I can see that in the training programmes related to business management, we are using our traditional sports to develop overall governance and develop mutual skills.
From children to elders, when everyone plays together, then the gap comes from generation to generation, it disappears miraculously.
At the same time, we know our culture and traditions.
Many sports create awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be created, playing on streets and threads, they will also see these games that appear to be adverse to our new generations, they will play and grow.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India has officially organised World Environment Day celebrations.
This time, the BEAT Plastic Pollution is a matter of fact.
I urge all of you to take a decision to prevent the use of Polythene and low-level plastics by understanding its importance on this occasion, and to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on the nature, the wildlife and our health.
Enter the website of the World Environment Day, Ved-China 2018, and many suggestions have been given very interestingly - see, know and try to carry them in your daily life.
Whenever there is heavy heat, whenever there is rains, whenever there is unbearable cold, everyone becomes a specialist, speaks about global heat and environmental change.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen that there is a strong wind in many parts of the country and it is not a natural season.
It has also caused lives.
All this is mainly the result of climate change
Our culture and our heritage have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live with nature and be associated with nature.
Gandhiji had come forward with this thing throughout his life and at every step.
We will not only settle in the middle of the tree, but also make a way to maintain it until it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
This is the message of Yoga for unity and a harmonious society, which the world has re-experienced for the past few years.
The psychology arises by singing yoga, which always protects us as a father.
In this case, the feeling arises, it is like their mothers in children, and mental peace becomes our sustainable friend.
Burthruhri said that the face of Yoga is our children, our brothers, our brothers, our beds, and wisdom are our hungry.
If all these virtues are companions of one, then the companion pours on all kinds of fears.
I once again call upon all the people of the country to take forward the tradition of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today, on 27th May, the memorial of the Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji.
This May belongs to someone else, he is the Veer Savarkar.
During the month of May, 1857, our countrymen expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and peasants opened up a gathering against injustice and demonstrated their evil.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was called a riot or a snake riot.
Indeed, this is not just an attempt to ignore our self-reliance and self-reliance.
Veer Savarkar, who wrote in 1857, was not merely a mess, but without fear of the first freedom struggle.
Several freedom fighters, in collaboration with Savarkar, celebrated the 50th anniversary in India House in London.
He is a man of arms and weapons, and is a specialist in handling.
We generally thank Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always embraced the poet, social reformer and solidarity of words.
I remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji's words about Savarkar ji, our dearest pride.
He was a poet of understanding and also a brave revolutionary.
I extend my best wishes and hopes for the bright future of this lady day.
If you want to achieve something, if you decide in your mind for that then you can achieve success with all the moments.
The story of some people who dedicate themselves to fulfilling the dreams of others is D.
Prakash Rao ji.
You will be surprised to know that today a common man who sells tea is inspiring education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I extend my warm greetings to Prakash Rao for his untiring hard work, his vision and his vision for brightening the lives of poor children and making a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in his life.
And who knows not the word of the scripture of Damascus Maa Jyotirgamya
But if there is a person who has done it, he is a D.
His life is a theme for all of us, for the society and for the entire country.
And it shall be, that there shall be such inspirations around you.
In a few more days, they will also wait for his arrival.
I am confident that everyone will celebrate this festival with great zeal and fervor, on this occasion, the children will get a great reward on a great day.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in this.
You can imagine the situation where thousands of sportspersons are participating from all over the world.
If there is an incidence of zeal, hope, inspiration, desires and aspirations - can there be no one who can be affected by this
..India has achieved unprecedented achievements.
It is a matter of pride for the soldiers to select medals, but it is a matter of pride for all the people of the country.
Encouraging and encouraging.
We are all together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I want to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
Why do I mean, many things have happened for the first time.
This time all the Martyrs who have participated in India's Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has featured medals in all the sports he has participated.
He is the first Indian woman to win the gold medal in the Table Tennis Singles.
India received a large number of gold shooting competitions.
India's only Para Power Lifter won the medal in Sachin's Saudi Commonwealth.
Moreover, if this time the competitions were special, the majority of the winners were women.
Whether it is square, bright or brown, the shooting competition, the women sportspersons performed their talents by playing very well.
The last competing of Bhubaneswar was between China and Nehwal, two of India's houses.
V.
It took place between Sindhu.
I was asking you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am very happy that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters to their support for this, share important issues related to their sex and Fit India information in the social media.
He shared the film that he took in the swimming pond, and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my loneliness and swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma is written by Devnath I feel happy and healthy after the morning walk
As for me, the smile is smiling, and when we are happy, we have to laugh.
After seeing all this, it is better that even many well-known people are inspiring our youth on a very interesting way to fit India.
Akshay Kumar has welcomed a video on Twitter.
His second video is also more popular, in which he can be seen playing with the people.
Many youngsters are sharing their experiences with fit India initiatives.
Not alone - Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the adults, men and women should work together with yoga.
How to experience holidays and where to go.
I call you a new work today
I can see many youth spending their time to learn something new now.
The importance of summer training is increasing, the youth are also engaged in search of this, accordingly training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, there is a feeling of living in a new dimension by writings and computers.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special exercise.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it sports sector or human resource development sector, these three Ministries of the Government of India have jointly organised Swachh Bharat Summer Exercise 2018.
You should go to MyGov website and register your participation in the Swachh Bharat Summit Internship.
I am confident that our youth will take this movement for cleanliness further.
Definitely send information from you, send photographs and compassionate video.
Come on
We will have the opportunity to learn during this holiday to get a new experience.
A few days ago, the youth of Delhi were showing a thing about some people in Good News India and they were doing a service to teach the poor children.
These youths have stepped up a massive movement to teach children and children living in the streets of Delhi.
These innovations were initiated because the conditions of children who were dragging on the streets or drastic jobs were swallowing them.
This movement, which started with 15 children in the dwelling area near Gita Colony, Delhi, is connecting 2000 children in 12 places in the capital today.
Youngsters, teachers, who are connected to this movement are trying to distribute two hours in their daily routine and transform the society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly region of Uttarakhand have become encouraging farmers across the country.
Their integrated efforts have not only enriched their position but also the future of their part.
Parallel of Uttarakhand, especially leopards, pigeons, peanuts and parli are cropped.
As a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They set up a collaborative organisation in Munnar village where they built a factory to prepare biscuits.
Seeing the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres in Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organisation has not only increased to Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs per year but it has also provided employment to more than 900 households, it has also prevented people from coming out of the district.
Everyone speaks about this, but isn't it our duty
Have we not seen that water conservation is the responsibility of society
It must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have been doing this for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of water every drop.
They have discovered new ways, and have come to know how to save every drop of water.
You might have noticed that some of you have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, some of the temples there are large inscriptions related to water conservation, drying up of dry days.
Big inscriptions are found in Mannar temple, Cheranmadevi, Mandir Pitti and Udaipur.
Even today, we should not forget that various staircasing wells are known as tourist destinations, which are the examples of the lives of our ancestors on the Water Conservation Mission.
Atal ji in Gujarat and Rani Kyi Wave in Patan have been declared the world heritage site of the UN Education, Science and Cultural Organization.
In April, May, June and July, they get an excellent opportunity to save rainwater, and the more we are ready to get the benefits.
The budget scheme of Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme is being spent only for water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, all efforts are being made to ensure water conservation and water management.
Every year, an average cost of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management for Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme.
In terms of 2017-18, about 55 per cent of the cost of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through such water conservation and water management.
7,000 people working under this scheme have worked hard in the seventeenth day and have revived the river Kuttamperur in Kerala.
The Ganga and Yamuntra, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers namely Sasur and Katheri have dried up in Fatehpur district.
The district administration faced the challenges of land and water conservation under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of about 40-45 villages, this dried Sasur and Katheri were renovated.
Whether it is a bird or a peasant or a peasant or a peasant or a village, how much blessings have you achieved
May, June and July are coming, we will take some responsibility for water conservation and water management. I once again urge you to fulfil some of our projects.
My dear countrymen, before the sound of Mann Ki Baat, there are reports from all around me, letters and phone calls.
Ian Kumar Banerji, from Devidola village of North 24 Barganas district of West Bengal, has registered his views on MyGov, though we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, many have not been aware of Rabindranath Tagore's Philosophy of Peace, Beautiful and Reality.
Please talk about this in Mann Ki Baat so that people can get an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore became a full form of wisdom and wisdom and his writings have put an unprecedented seal in the minds of all those who read.
Rabindranath - we can feel that he is wise, multi-dimensional, but he has a teacher every week.
He wrote in his Keethanjali, "He, who has the knowledge of the responsibilities to the members, that is, he has the responsibility to teach the students.
I was not aware of Bengali language, but I had a habit of waking up early in my childhood, radio broadcasting in eastern India will start soon and west India will start late.
When there is an opportunity to listen to these poems, Anandloke, Aguner and Poroshmoni, there will be great inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet must have recited his poems.
My dear countrymen, in a few days Ramlan will start the holy month.
The month of Ramlan is celebrated all over the world with pride and pride.
The social side of Non-Pen is that he feels the hungry of others only when a man squeezes, and he is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to recall the message and message given by the sovereign Mohammad Nabis.
Equality and brotherhood are the lessons that we learn from his life.
Once a man asked the sovereign, it was very important to understand what was done in Israel.
Its sovereignty, he said, "Whatever we don't know, we don't know them, we have to be compassionate to everyone."
The sovereign Mohammad Nabis believed in wisdom and blessings.
And it shall come to pass in the month of Ramadan, that if any thing be more than yourselves, you shall give it to the needy, and the sovereign Mohammad Nabi shall say, And it shall come to pass in the month of Ramadan.
People give their lives to the poor in this holy month.
The sovereign Mohammad Nabis say that no soul is desolate because of his clean soul, and not because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered the millions of people in the smoothness of the Constitution, the victims, the deprived, the oppressed.
There is no better example of blessings.
Blessedness was one of the greatest features of Buddhist Buddhist religions in pursuing the plight of the people.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, Buddha's traditions are linked to their roots.
This is the reason why we are enhancing the infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asian countries to India's special Buddhist destinations.
Today, there are conflicts and sorrows of people all over the world and the teachings of Buddhist Buddha show the way out of hatred.
I extend my best wishes to the Buddhists and those who believe in the principles of blessings and beliefs across the world for Buddha Purnima.
I respect the blessings from the Buddhists to the whole world, through which we can fulfil our responsibility of creating a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
When you have heard about the statues of Laughing Buddha, it is said that this smiling Buddha will get the privilege, but some people know that Buddha, who smiles, belongs to an important event in the security of India.
Yes, you can imagine what is the relationship between Bhunsir Buddha and the Indian soldiers.
There is a new self-confidence in the Indian diaspora spread all over the world.
That day is a Buddha full moon.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted nuclear weapons tests in Bokron, Rajasthan on its western border.
India's test was successful, in a way, it may be said that India has demonstrated its strength in the field of Science and Technology.
On that day, in the history of India, the power of our armed forces was decorated with golden signs.
Lord Buddha demonstrated that the power of Andrathma is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a nation today, we can be peaceful with all of us.
On the day of the world, we demonstrated that India is capable of achieving new goals and summits every day under the strong leadership of India-Bhumi great scientists.
The journey that Atal ji had started and the new joy and joy to move forward is seen before us.
My dear countrymen, we can again enter the voice of Mann Ki Baat and we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the day of Rama Navami.
On this holy day, my best wishes to all the people of the country.
We were able to see how much 'Ram Ram' was in his life in every moment of his life.
On January 26, when all the leaders of the ASEAN organisation came here, they brought a group of culture with them
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries gave the Ramayana to all of us.
That is, Ramayana and not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this region of the world, is still affecting the same inspiration and impact.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every time, all your letters, emails, telephone information and comments have been received at large.
You have been asking for the launch of edition of edition of edition of essays online in Komal Ducker ji's MyGov and I read it.
Besides from the Department of Collectorate, it is heartening to see their attraction on culture.
I have been telling you about the efforts made by the concerned sector.
I urge all those who are engaged in the work of culture to listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat and to suggest how to implement the ideals of Gomal.
I read what I have written in the Narendra Modi App, Kanshyam Kumar ji from the village of Pararar, Nalanda district of Bihar.
You are worried about the decline in groundwater level, it is certainly an important thing.
And in the summer, you are asking that the water should be drunk for animals and birds.
Shakal ji, I bring your sentiments to all the leaders.
You know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said this time he is asking the youth about health.
He believes that our youth are physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I want to talk to everyone in detail about health - I talk about a healthy India (Fit India).
Youngsters, you can collaborate and implement a healthy India Mission.
In the past, the President of France had visited Kashi when he had visited our country and all the scenes of that journey were fascinating and was not going to have an impact.
I urge you to make them lakes, dwell and take them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh and many more children from Chennai have written to me on my book 'Exam Warrior' gratitude cards.
I want to tell Anna, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all my fatigue of that day was lost as the snow that saw everyone.
If I can read from these letters, such phone calls, comments, so many things that I can hear are in touch with my mind.
I have to tell you about it only for months.
This time most of the letters are written by children, they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday plans.
They have expressed concern over the water for animals and animals in the summer.
There are letters from farmers brothers and sisters regarding the activities of farmers' festivals and agricultural activities across the country.
Some citizens have had positive suggestions on water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture and our heritage are facing issues.
That is, things of mind are changing according to the climate and the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the climate of life.
Why shouldn't you change
In these matters, in your experiences, in these examples, the sensitivity, the power, the thirst to do something good for the country is reflected.
They have the power to change the environment of the entire country.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I knew how a rickshaw driver from the Karimganj district of Assam, Ahmad Ali, had created 9 schools to read poor children with his deep desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of proper treatment, Calcutta's taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died.
He reiterated his commitment to build a hospital to ensure that no poor can die due to lack of treatment.
Saidul sold the jewellery of his house, collected money in his own way.
Several travellers travelled in his taxi paid money with their hearts.
A engineer gave himself his first month's salary.
In this way, by collecting money, spending 12 years and finally, Sayedul Laskar's favorite effort gave the benefits.
Today, due to his hard work, a hospital with 30 beds is being prepared in Puneri village near Kolkata.
Such sensitivities are introducing and marking my country.
Today, when India's name is highly honoured, after that the unparalleled acts of the wealth of this Mother India's wealth are suppressed.
Today, this belief is born in the minds of everybody in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle of the country.
We can move forward and progress from our country.
There has been a conscious and constructive environment with desires and desires.
This spirit of self-confidence, this positive feeling, will fulfil our dream of a New India, and boost our mindset.
My dear countrymen, it will be very important for the farmers brothers and sisters for months now.
This is the reason why many letters have come to agriculture.
This time, when I see the video of discussions with the farmers on the Kisan Table for the farmers of Darshan, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the DD Kisan Table, see it and implement the uses shown there in their fields.
Gandhiji, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Sautri Saran Singh or Sautri Devi, all have been considered as an important part of the country's economy and the lives of the people.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji also spoke of the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and special agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that to ensure greater income for our farmers, special irrigation facilities and to increase the production of food and milk, a large number of people must be aware.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and create innovations and strengthen their needs.
I had visited the Festival of Agricultural Development in Delhi in the past.
It was my pleasure to understand, understand and understand the innovations related to agriculture, while interacting with farmers brothers and scientists.
But what had had a great impact on me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This lowland area has done a big job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved the masses in 2015-16 as compared to the last five years.
If the goal is decided, if there is an inspiration, if the tension is deep then it can be achieved and achieved.
Today, technology is also handing over the hard work of the farmers, which is causing considerable strength to the farmers.
Brothers and sisters, In the budget this year, a big resolution has been taken to make the farmers cost-friendly prices.
Besides, the work on farm marketing reforms in the country is going on in order to get the right price for farmers' products.
Efforts are being made to connect the rural regional markets, gross markets and global markets.
The APMC and e-NAM platform will be integrated while the farmers are unnecessarily able to go a long way in selling their products, while creating a necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country.
In a way, this kind of system is being created to connect with any market in the country from the region.
My dear countrymen, this year the celebrations of Gandhijis 150th birth anniversary began.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can 125 crore Indians be able to contribute to Gandhijis very specially
Can you organise new events
Can you create new ways
I urge you all to share your views on this by MyGov.
What would be the sign of 'Kandhi 150'
What can the fuck be
Let me write your comments about these.
Today, the health sector has gone through a common approach across the country.
All the works related to health in the country were previously responsible for the Ministry of Health, but now all sectors, Ministries - whether it is the Ministry of AYUSH or the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments - all are working together for a healthy India, immunization is not being pressurized with health and low cost health.
Disease prevention health is a very low cost and is also very easy.
The more we are aware of immunity health, the better it will be for the individual, the family and the society.
The first need for healthy life is cleanliness.
We are all committed to a nation, which has resulted in double healthcare in the last four years.
Besides, widespread work is being done in the direction of setting up of healthcare centres across the country.
As a disease prevention healthcare, Yoga has identified itself with new energy all over the world.
Yoga guarantees both physical and health.
This is the result of our endeavour and today Yoga has become a mass movement and every household has its place.
There are more than 100 days left on June 21, the coming International Day of Yoga.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and the world have participated with great zeal.
This time we will also ensure that Yoga will inspire all of us, family and friends.
It should be further elaborated to all the adults, children, youth and senior citizens, handing over new interesting methods.
Moreover, television and electronics from all over the country are providing various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement from now to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
But some people have transformed me into Yoga through their manufacturing and have created three-thirds like Yoga.
A wide range of efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and to be affordable and accessible to the common man.
Today, more than 3000 people have opened medicine centres across the country and more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Further, new centres are being opened.
I urge the leaders of Mann Ki Baat - you must take the information about these people's medication centres to those who need it.
This will be the biggest service you will do to them.
Heart stents for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of Orthopaedic Surgery has also been fixed and reduced from 50 to 70 percent.
Under Ayushman Bharat, about 10 crore households, that is, about 50 crore citizens are being treated and Rs. 5 lakh is going to be spent for the family in a year.
The number of medical hospitals in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS (AIMS) hospitals are being opened in many states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts.
By 2025, the target of the country to get rid of TB has been set.
Today, the Make in India Mission is working successfully in the country.
The same day Dr. Ambedkar ji dreamed of India as an industrial power and his vision is inspiring us all today.
Today, India is emerging as a brightest hub in the world economy and the highest FDI in the world is coming to India.
The world over has turned India into a centre for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-reliance.
He doesn't want any man to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, if he shares something to the poor, they don't think that their poverty will go away.
Today, the Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India Terms, innovators and entrepreneurs of our youth have been created.
Today, historic efforts are being made on the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the 40 discussions were surrounding World War II, the emerging ice war and the country's division.
During that period, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of the spirit of Team India on one side.
He spoke of the significance of the federalism and strengthened the central and state governments to work together for the progress of the country.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of Competitive Federalism as cooperative federalism in all aspects of the administration
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar becomes a seminar for crores of people like me from the backward class.
He has shown us that there is no need to be born in a big family or in a Siman family to move forward, the poor in India can dream, the entire effort can be made to fulfil those dreams and success can be achieved.
But the painting of New India is totally different.
I urge you to participate in this movement with zeal.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to be held in the next few days like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter and Paisaki.
It is a day to recall the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, whom we have possessed the message of ahimsa, gives us sympathy.
My best wishes to all the people of the country on Mahavir Jayanti.
Whenever there is talk of Easter, the instructions of Jesus Christian inspire will be remembered and the messages of humanity are always given by him, peace, harmony, justice, blessings and blessings.
Feasibility Festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
On the same day, the festival of Sathuvain in Bihar is celebrated with joy and joy and joy in Phihu in Assam and Poila in West Bengal.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
From the beginning of today, I start with a phone call from Mann Ki Baat.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science, some have written letters.
We all know that the colour of the sea is blue, but because of our daily experiences there is no color for you.
Be it the river, be it the sea, why do we ever think that you look bright
The same question took place in the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendranath Bose was given to the well-known Christians and it is called Boson.
A few days ago, Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence - Watwani had participated in the inauguration of Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It is interesting to know about the miracles in the scientific sector.
The artificial intelligence is envisaging the creation of robots, B (B) and specific operational instruments.
Today, the machines are making their sensitivity stronger through machines.
This technology can make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
On this occasion of Artificial Intelligence, I urge the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful in making the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters easier.
Can you know more about the occurrence of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can you help the farmers on the consequences
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate access to healthcare and help in diagnosing diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I went with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I-creat project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man and a digital instrument.
If those who are unable to speak through this instrument, then the instrument transforms it into a voice and does it as if they are talking to each other.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and technology are medium valued.
They don't have any self-respect.
Any instrument will work as we want.
Thomas Alva Edition, who discovered Light Bulby, had failed in many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, I have discovered ten thousand ways to make a light bulb.
That is, Edison has also turned his defeats into his power.
Today, I am in Aurobindo, the birthplace of Maharishi Aravind, not only a sudden event but also a great deal for me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, raised many questions against their regime.
As a great Rishi, he questioned every aspect of life.
He also discovered the answers and showed way to humanity.
Knowing the truth, the feeling of raising questions again and again is important.
This is also the true concept behind the scientific search.
Why, don't you live until you know how to answer questions.
I extend my best wishes to all our scientists and scientists on National Science Day.
Ravindra Singh ji from Pune has written on the Occupational Safety i. e.
Defence standards in our country are not so important in factories and construction workplaces.
On March 4, as the National Security Day, the Prime Minister should speak in his mind about security, so that there is awareness about security in people's minds.
While we talk about public security, two things are very important - one to be careful and the other to be prepared.
Defence is two ways, one being important during disasters, the other is essential in daily life.
It is difficult to achieve this situation in disasters if we say that we are not aware of security in our daily lives and are not safe.
That is why these words have no use in our lives.
When we relieve natural calamities, most of the people are due to some of our faults.
If we are aware, if we follow the necessary rules then we can save our lives and save our society from the greatest places.
Sometimes we might have seen many words about security in our workplaces, but we have seen that they are not following the slope.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities to conduct a model training in schools once a week or once a month.
This country includes many natural disasters and disasters created by a human being related to chemical and factory that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the nations disaster management.
Self-servicemen have been trained in the districts where the floods have been hit and the name of the dangers has also been given.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of lives were lost due to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency organised training graduates to protect people from the heat wave and to create awareness among the people.
There was a good impact on everyone's contribution.
The number of deaths due to heat wave attacks decreased by about 220 in 2017 as compared to expected.
This indicates that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We have to turn into a society that warns against danger.
We have been flying several times and the Air Force is providing defence information from the very beginning of the journey.
Well, was there a way of providing information
Similarly, we have experience in every sector of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, wealth from waste to waste and energy manufacturing have been emphasized in villages through natural gas.
The initiatives taken for this have been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources, i. e.
The programme aims at cleaning villages, cattle feeding, cultivation of fields, fertilizer and natural gas, to create wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use cattle food and livestock to generate energy
But India is not fully in this field.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are moving forward in this direction.
It has been decided to improve the manufacturing of natural energy through livestock, agricultural wastes and sanitation deficits.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, brothers and sisters in rural India should be encouraged and they should not only see food and waste as a measure of wealth.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste collection, transport and natural gas sales.
An online business platform will be set up to facilitate efficient implementation of the Cobber-Dhan scheme, connecting the farmers with the buyers and making the right price for the cropping of the farmers.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about some kind of festivals like music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a special effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, where the first Kuppa Festival of the state was organised.
Raipurs inspired and other districts also held Kup Festivals for their participation.
Everybody shared innovative ideas regarding cleanliness in their own way, held discussions, organised poetry.
There was an atmosphere like a festival, focusing on cleanliness.
In particular, school children participated with great zeal, it was a marvellous thing.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the government administration for the celebration of this festival in a very nutritious manner of waste management and importance of cleanliness.
Every year, we celebrate International Womens Day on 8th March.
Several events are being organised in our country and all over the world on this occasion.
In the past, women who have performed models in different fields are felicitated with the Nari Shakti Award this day.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led progress in the direction of progress.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our obligation to ensure that women's participation in every sector of the socio-economic situation is equal.
Today, our women's strength is showing self-confidence and self-confidence in their activities.
Where women are empowered and are partners in all the developments of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days since January 26 this year, these women have built one lakh and seventy thousand toilets and have created a model which includes about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of the common people, women from Jharkhand have shown the strength of Swachh Bharat and Swachh Sanskrit, which has the power to transform it into the nature of the people.
Brothers and sisters, When I was watching the news two days ago, how happy they were about how much electricity came after 70 years of independence in 3 villages of Elephanta Islands.
I am surprised to know that despite being such a special tourist destination, it has not reached there for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Eliphanda Island - Rajbandhar, Morbandar and Sendbandar - were away from the lives of those living in darkness and brightness.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
Let us say that the lives of the countrymen be bright, let their lives grow satisfactions, let us know what other time can be a pleasure and joy.
Brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we celebrated the Shivaratri festival.
In March, the green fields, the beauty of the slopy crops and the beauty of the beauty of the chemical fertilizers - are the special features of this month.
At the same time, the Holi festival that comes this month is closer to all of us.
On March 2, the Holi festival will be celebrated with great enthusiasm all over the country.
The importance of the festival of Holi is the importance of Holika, because this day, we pour all the evils into the nest.
This Holi Festival is a great occasion to forget all the differences and participate in each other's satisfaction and to commemorate unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripadhi ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and I am very asking you to talk about all the things that are in it.
Kalpana Sawla, who went to space on 1st February, was a hiding day.
They are not with us today because the Colombia space is dangerous, but they have been inspiring the youth around the world.
In this way, I express my gratitude to Prakash ji for commencement of his letter by expressing the hidden day of Kalpana Chawla ji.
It is a matter of great sadness to all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla in such a small age, but they have left the news that there is no boundary for women, especially for thousands of Indian women all over the world.
It is a matter of great pleasure that women in India are progressing at a rapid pace in every sector and maintaining the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country and their contribution to the society has been surprised all over the world.
It details the importance of women in our society.
This has given the status of power to women in our society.
It has always been inspired by the wisdom, devotion, the ruling system of Ahilyabai Holkar, the bravery of Rani Laxmibai, and the dignity of the country.
Prakash Tripadhi ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has conceived her fleeing in the sky on 30th of Sukoi and also described the visit of the Indian Navy's Women's Group under the leadership of Vartika Joshi to the INSV TARINI.
The three serving women of Bhawanakhand, Mohana Singh and her Chaturvedi have become warriors and are conducting the training of Sukoi 30.
You're absolutely right to say.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all sectors but also leading them.
Today, for the first time in many sectors, the achievement of women-power is being understood and a milestone is being established.
In the past, the Honble President has made a new endeavour.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women in their respective fields.
These women achievements of the country, the first lady captain of the ships, the first lady driver of the passenger train, the first lady driver, the first lady bus driver, the first lady to reach Antarctica, the first lady to touch the Everest, the first woman to reach out to Antarctica.
With the help of hard work, drive and stressful strength, they have proved to be a new path by crossing all barriers and borders.
On this path, they are not only inspiring from their times but also from generations.
They have filled a new zeal and a new inspiration.
This lady accomplisher has also written a book on women who have come first to know about these women's capabilities and inspire them through their lives.
This book is available on the Narendra Modi App in the form of e-book today.
Today, in the creative changes in the country and society, women's power plays an important role.
Today, when we are talking about the empowerment of women, I want to tell you about a railway station.
You can imagine what connectivity can be between a railway station and the empowerment of women.
All employees and women at Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
This time, after watching the Republic Festival, many of the special issues mentioned on the Divers and other social websites are about the bicycles of the border police station and all the women involved in this group are women.
They understood the adventurous acts and the exhibition was surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women and women are headed.
Self-sufficient shape is taking place.
I see the surprising work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh and they have given a new exhibition.
While talking about tribal women, there is a decisive sight in everyone's mind, there are forests, roads and women burdened with head.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women and women have created a new scene before the country.
The area of Dandewada in Chhattisgarh is suffering from Maoist extremists.
Maoists have created a horrific situation here as violence, repression, bombs, guns and gardens.
In such a terrible situation, tribal women have become self-sufficient and self-sufficient.
Besides, environmental protection is also being strengthened.
I also compliment the government administration here and they have played an important role in the success of these women till they have been given financial assistance and training.
Absolution of cases and adoption of changes in the required.
Efforts have been made individually and socially in the country for centuries against social disorders and destructions.
A few days ago, an interesting process was carried out in Bihar.
A human chain programme of more than 13,000 kms was organised in Bihar to root out social inequalities.
This movement inspired awareness against evils such as child marriage and immunization.
All the people of the state have decided to fight against injustice and child marriage.
Children, elders, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters, all have come forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historical Gandhi Maidan in Patna, this man chain is long and undoubtedly connected to the border of the state.
If all sections of the society have to get the benefits of real progress, then our society should get rid of such disorders.
Together, we all have a swearing-in that we will not disappear from the society.
Let us create a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
People have been writing letters to me about this thing for some time now.
I have seen a number of television and social media related to the beneficiaries through this scheme.
It gives me the idea of getting the darshan and getting to the others.
The objective behind this scheme is to enhance healthcare and enhance ease of living.
Medicines available in public medicines are less than 50 to 90 percent of the cost of commercialised medicines.
This provides economic benefits to the senior citizens, especially the medicines used by the common people, especially for daily use. This increases savings.
The generic medicines that are purchased here are in accordance with the standards of the World Health Organization.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has set up more than 3000 people medicines across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at cheaper prices and entrepreneurs have also created new employment opportunities for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi and Amrut Bazar of Hospitals are available.
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and regulatory healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a picture on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The picture attracted me very much.
One of them participated in the movement of Swachhta Morana River in collaboration with his grandma.
The citizens of Akola have carried out the cleanliness of the Morana river in connection with this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the river Morna has grown for 12 months in a time, it has now become a climate.
Another sad thing here is that the river has wild animals and waterfalls.
I am told that this Swachhata Mission continued on 20th January, 2018 and this movement will continue every Saturday till the Morana river is fully cleaned.
It shows that if one has to make a resolution to try, it's nothing that he cannot achieve.
Peoples movement can also make big changes.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration and all the citizens participating in the movement of the people and this effort will give you the pride to other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is an exchange of views on the Padma Awards given by the President tomorrow.
Newspapers and televisions are attracted to this.
But it is a matter of great pride to you, and it is very proud to be among us, and to get awards and recognition without any recommendation.
There is no need to be a person who is now awarded, but his actions are marked.
He has been manufacturing sports products from the poultry for 40 years, so that he works as a scientific enthusiast for the children.
He has been trying to see scientific tests by taking unprofitable products.
For this, he is going to 3000 schools all over the country and encouraging films made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, look at the best dedication
The life of Siddhava Jodhi in Karnataka is the same.
There is no point in calling him a goddess who empowered her daughters.
He has played a major role in changing the lives of innumerable women for the last 30 years from Belgavi.
From the age of 7, he dedicated himself to a god, and spent his whole life for the welfare of the gods.
Not only this, he has worked unprecedentedly for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh and he was born in the very poor tribal family.
Though he had done a simple job for his livelihood, he had a immense country on the paintings of traditional tribals.
This is the reason why he has a value not only in India but also all over the world.
His paintings have been shown in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
Bhajaju Shyam, who has specialized the name of India abroad, has been given Padmasri Awards.
The life of Laxmikutty, a tribal woman from Kerala, can be a surprise to you.
Laxmikutty works as a teacher in Kalar area and even today he lives in a hungry habitation in dense forests and tribal habitations.
He has been tested in the production of medicines used after snake bite.
Laxmi ji is continuously serving the society through her medicinal knowledge.
Padmasree has been awarded for his contribution to the society by identifying anybody's absence.
Today, I would like to say about another one, and the 75-year-old Subashini Mistry of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subashini Mistry ji washed vessels in many houses to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital built by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, they have to take and share their experiences.
After all the awards, the society must also make some efforts.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate the day of NRIs.
On the same day, Anal Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate the undivided contribution between India and the Indians around the world.
This year, we have organised a programme for NRIs, including members and mayors from India and from all over the world.
The event was attended by immigrant Indians in many countries such as Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States, as well as members of parliament.
Some of them have printed in many fields such as cybercare, Ayurveda, music, poetry, climate change and Indian literature, and are making a mark for themselves.
Some people have built Gurudwaras as trek drivers, some have built mosques, that is, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow someho.
I express my gratitude to the European Federation for recognising the excellent work of NRIs and for their remarkable work to reach out to all over the world.
Even today, we are seen in every stage that how true the teachings of the people are.
If we decide to go through the footsteps of the brother, what more than that can we pay for him
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
We have shared many things throughout the year.
The exchange of your letters, ideas and ideas for the voice of Mann Ki Baat has always been giving me a new energy.
And a few hours later, the year will change, but our shares continue to continue as always.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for 2018.
A few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated Christmas Festival in a humorous manner.
We can also see the essence of service integrity.
This shows us what is the importance of service integrity.
In our country, we are talking about the visionary hatred, that is, there is no hope of reflection in such activity.
The service is said to be the best trust.
My dear countrymen, this year, 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice will inspire us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the teachings of greater life and values, and on the basis of those values, he lived his whole life.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, inspired the people through all these contributions.
He touched the war against oppression and injustice.
In this struggle, he lost many things in his personal life.
But he has never left in his mind any time to discontent.
Every moment of life gave the message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen such a great specialty
At the outset of this year, I got the opportunity to participate in Guru Gobind Singh's 350th birth anniversary celebrations in Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all learn from Guru Gobind Singh's great teachings and his visionary life and try to improve our lives.
Those who are born in 2000 or after that, i. e.
I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India in India's democratic form.
I extend my best wishes to these youngsters and I urge all of you to go and register you as voters.
All over India, as a voter of the 21st century, is going on for you.
To make a positive change in the lives of millions of people, vote is a big impact.
You will not be empowered only to vote.
Today, in the voice of my mind, I would like to talk about our glorious young society, which was 18-25 years old, which was eager and powerful.
I consider them a New India Youth, a youth of a New India, a youth of a New India, a youth, a youth, a zeal and energy.
I am confident that our dream of a New India will be fulfilled by the capabilities and capabilities of these empowered youth.
When we talk about a New India, we must be free from casteism, religion, terrorism and corruption.
It must be free from dirt and poverty.
There should be equal opportunities for all in New India, the desires and aspirations of all should be fulfilled.
In a new India, peace, unity and harmony must be our guiding powers.
Come forward, my youngsters of this new India, and how to create a New India.
Young people from 18 to 25 years of age can sit together to exchange ideas about New India, find ways and plans
Do you think how to fulfil our resolutions before 2022
Can we advise the dreams of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhiji transformed the freedom struggle into a mass destruction.
My young friends, we also need to create a mass destination to create the highest India of the 21st century, which is a mass movement for progress.
How to achieve success through stress
Today there have been many new opportunities before the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and seeing success.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken about the importance of positive and positive thinking in the voice of the last mind.
There is a case in English - Passimism leaves to wakes, optimism to power.
I was asking the last Mann Ki Baat to share the creative moments of 2017 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people have given positive answers to social institutions, MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Millions of tweets have also been made in Positive India Hashtag, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of negativeness has spread from India to the world.
The documents and answers that have come are really sympathetic.
It was a pleasant experience to me.
Some people of the country have mentioned some of the events that have had a positive impact on their minds this year.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Meenu Patia.
I live in Baket on Festival of Mayorvihar, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
I wanted to read.
For this, I needed loans, it was easy for me and my daughters could continue to read.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I dwell in the bottom.
My husband had done the risk of paying one rupee a month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life.
We only know about the worst situation that we have ever had.
Because of the help of the government, we had a lot of benefits and we were able to afford it.
My name is Santosh Jadav.
The National Highway was set up in 2017 through the village after us.
Because of this, our roads have become very excellent and our business has begun to grow.
My name is Deepansu Ahuja, in the Sadganj district of Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bawani.
For the past 40 years, we have been dependent on the military's drainage pipe.
Now alone we have a water pipeline...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to various activities in their own conditions.
Indeed, this is a New India, which we are building together.
Come, let us take this little pleasure in innovation and take a firm step towards a creative India from positive India to a creative India.
When we all talk about creative ideas, I feel like sharing a thing.
I have heard about the stories of the excellently elected Anjanjam Bashir Khan Kathak in the Kashmir State Governance Examinations.
He has emerged from the bond of extremism and poverty and has been the elite in the state of Kashmir's regime.
You will be shocked to know that in the 1990s the terrorists have burnt his ancestral house.
At the time of terrorism and violence, his family was forced to drive out their ancestors.
He never left faith.
He made a way for himself - it is a way to serve the people.
He had come out of the opposite conditions and spent his victory.
Today, he is not only a JK but also an inspiration for all India.
Whatever the situation is bad, Anjaj has proved that through positive actions, he can dissolve and dissolve the wasteful tables.
Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
These are the strengths of the country, these are the future of my country.
Thousands of devotees come every year to this world famous temple to get the blessings of Ayyappan.
But the Sabarimali Temple is an example of how to transform cleanliness into a culture, how to find a way to solve the problem, how to make people's contribution a power.
B.
The police officer, Vijayan, launched a programme called Punya Parkavan, whereby he launched a Swachhta Mission for Swachhta Awareness.
This pilgrimage movement, which has progressed in Sabarimali, has become a part of the journey of every traveller.
At the same time, there is a strong resolution of cleanliness along with difficulty.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we have made a resolution and we have not fulfilled the work that is, Swachh Bharat, Mass Free India.
He has worked for the entire life of his brother and tried it.
On the 150th birth anniversary of his brother, we have decided to dedicate to him a Swachh Bharat and contribute to that direction.
Efforts are being made in detail in the direction of cleanliness across the country.
There is a widespread transformation in rural and urban areas with the help of mass movement.
The quality of cleanliness in urban areas is to be undertaken from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 and the worlds largest survey called Swachh Survekshan 2018.
This study will cover about 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The Survey will be calculated in the areas of Open Defecation Free (ODF) in the cities, collection of poultry, transportation of poultry, processing of scientific poultry, transformation of operation, capacity building and innovative tools for cleanliness and participation of people in this work.
According to this survey, different groups will go to cities and conduct research.
They will speak to the citizens and get answers from them.
They will examine the use of the Swachh App and the development of various services centres.
It will also be considered whether all the organisations have been built in cities to make the cleanliness of the city the nature of the people and the nature of the city.
The government should not be able to implement cleanliness only.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a major role in this.
On the basis of this survey, if the standards of cities are set, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, the level of the country is less than one lakh and the area level will be provided.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share something with you through this event.
If a Muslim woman wants to travel to Haj then she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male insurance.
When I heard about this for the first time, how can this happen
Why has this distinction ever emerged.
For many years Islamic women have been injustice, but there has been no discussion on this.
Such a rule does not exist in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to Indian Islamic women.
I am happy that our government has focused on this.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has taken necessary measures and ended the tradition that lasted for 70 years and has removed this control.
I am glad that this time 1300 Islamic women have prayed for Haj without male-servicemen, from Kerala to North India and from different parts of the country, women have been keen to travel to Haj.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has been instructed to ensure that all the women who have requested to travel alone for Haj pilgrimage.
I am confident that Indias development journey is progressing with the strength of our women and their intellectuals, and it is my commitment to further progress.
Our sustainable efforts should be made to reach out to male and female selectors and they will also be able to grow on the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, all of us are historically important.
However, on January 26, 2018, it will be specially remembered.
Heads of 10 countries in the ASEAN organisation are also coming to India as key guests this year.
This time, not one, but ten leading guests will participate on the occasion of the President.
It has not happened so far in the history of India.
In 2017, the ASEAN organisation was very important for India.
The ASEAN organisation completed its 50-year period in 2017, with the ASEAN organisation, India's collective 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us Indians that on January 26, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate here.
It's very imperfect that there's no piece of money on any day.
Now we have celebrated Christmas Festival and the next year is going to be born.
May the upcoming New Year bless everyone with great satisfaction, joy and completion.
Let us all move forward with a new temper, a new zeal, a new inspiration, a new resolution and a nation.
In January, the dawn of the Sun will be celebrated this month.
This is a time associated with nature.
In fact, every festival is attached to nature somehow, but in our diverse culture, there is a habit of celebrating this marvellous event of nature in different ways.
If there is an increase in the joy of Lohri in Punjab and Northern states, it is expected that in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar there will be Kichadi and Dil Sankranti.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Pihu in Assam, and Tamil Nadu will be called Pongal, all of which have their own specialty and there is a special significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Although these are different from the name, the principle of their foundation is the link between nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to all the people of the country on this occasion.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the 2018 New Year.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
There is a doubt that there will be no Indian citizens who don't respect him, who don't value him.
He was more senior than all of us at the age, witnessed in different stages of the country and in different periods.
Not only our new generation, but all of us have this experience of great learning, you have become a great concept of all of us, but you have always been very comfortable for your parents' development and work.
This feeling will be very close to me.
Nizama, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how much you are doing, and how much you have to do, and how much you have to do.
Moti ji: Yeah.
And Moses said, Because of your love, let us rejoice very much.
And Mothi ji said, I am grateful to me for you have continued to wait on me.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you on the birth anniversary.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought of talking to you.
We all celebrate innumerable festivals like Navaratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Deepawali, Baiya Dhuj, Satpuja.
In many cities, many government organisations and start-ups of the youth are engaged in this work.
They integrate the garments, sweets, food items in the houses of the people, search the needy and carry them to them without any advertisement.
This time, in this season of festivals, will we break the darkness of the brightness of the lamp with full awareness and consciousness
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your joy in the festivals, and your face will be brighter, and your brightness will brighter, and your lamp will brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the day of Deepawali, the people of the house are welcomed to provide a lot of consciousness and abundance of lives.
We welcome yourself traditionally.
Will this time we welcome yourself in a new way
In our culture, we salute women in the form of gentlemen because the woman is considered to be comfortable and sufficient.
Can we organise programmes this time in our society, in our villages, in cities and women
You can organise public events and women who have achieved their hard work and endeavour will be among us, in our families, in our society and in our country.
Can we not organise programmes to provide honour and pride to these youngsters of India during this Deepavali
Women who have done many extraordinary jobs may have been among us.
Someone might have been trying to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been engaged in some social service that he is a doctor, an engineer, a teacher, a teacher of education for poor children.
As a prosecutor, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and be proud of them.
Just as we all have launched a mission called a telephone with daughters all over the world, we will eradicate the mission of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
Encouraging India's gentlemen means ensuring the lives of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I had already spoken about the voice of Mann Ki Baat, and this gives me the opportunity to interact with the most beneficial and unaware people.
In the past, Alina Tayang, a student in remote Arunachal Pradesh, wrote to me an interesting letter.
I am from the Roying area of Arunachal Pradesh.
When my decisions came this time, some people asked me if you are reading the books of exam voters.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and I read it twice or three times again.
After that, my experience was very sweet.
My breeding students, thank you for writing the letter.
Moreover, I am grateful to you all for showing me the shortcomings in the course of reading.
I will follow your commandment.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again, I express my gratitude to our young friend, student Alina Tayang, from Arunachal.
My hearts and my countrymen, you will be aware of the continuous programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through TV, and you will be discussing the lack of restlessness and deliberations.
This time, as much as the US Open contest was spoken of, Medveda's speech, which was the second in the final contest.
I also heard a more spoken speech on social websites and then I saw the flame.
Matwede's simplicity and his honour, which was 23 years old, was all capable.
If there were others, he would have been annoyed and disappointed, but he had no argument on his face, but he laughed with his words in the back and pain of everyone.
All the visitors from there welcomed his speech in a big way.
In one flame, the zeal of the creator and the jealousy of the winner was fascinating.
If you say you haven't heard Medveda's speech so far, especially to the youth, please look, listen.
There are many things to learn from all sections of the society and from all ages.
These moments are supposed to have lost success, and there is no meaning in the failure of success.
Life is successful, and our scriptures are very specially telling us this thing.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really surprising.
Mani Kanchana Samyog: The folklore of the people is enjoyment: that is, if a person has the ability and work together, then he cannot win his heart.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My heart, my countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to tell you this thing for your direct welfare.
But in the beginning, if we were to be awakened and prevented, it would be very safe.
I want to tell you one thing, especially to the younger community, keeping this feeling in mind.
It is very difficult for you all to know that the drug addiction of tobacco is very bad for health.
Those who use smoke have more risk of getting diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
It affects the growth of brain in childhood due to its habits .
But today, I have come to share a new thing with you.
You know, now e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
E-cigarette is different from ordinary cigarettes.
In the e-cigarette, smoke of nicotine liquid is produced in a variety of smoke that involves nicotine.
We all are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misunderstanding of e-cigarette has been widespread.
That means there is no danger from this e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there is no smell in it, they add a fragrant substance.
If a father in a house is constantly smoking, we might have seen near us that he would not smoke others in that house, and he would like to have a habit of smoking his children like himself.
His effort will be that no one in the family should smoke.
Because he knows how bad the body will be when smoking or smoking.
The smoker smokes knowingly, and the father also knows it well.
But this is not about e-cigarette.
There is no awareness about e-cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger, so sometimes the e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, the e-cigarettes are mixed with a number of insufficient substances, which will have adverse effects on health.
If anybody smokes in the surroundings, the filth thereof will show us.
It is because of the dreams of every family that it should not be driven on foot.
Remove the habit of smoking and do not take any wrong ideas related to e-cigarettes.
Come, let us together build a healthy India.
Yes, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India doesn't mean that at least two o'clock in the morning and at least two o'clock in the evening.
It is important to stay away from these things.
I believe that you don't feel bitter to say that it will definitely happen to you.
They have dedicated themselves to others, not to live for themselves.
One such person is honoured in the hunting city on October 13.
The works done by Christmas Treasury for the welfare of the human society in the last 50 years of his life are an example of the whole world.
He had a special interest in social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians are committed to liberating from the illiteracy and illiteracy.
In the direction of environmental protection, India is leading the world in a way, and today the eyes of all countries are on India.
I am fully confident that all of you will participate in the movement of liberating from the negligence used once on 2nd October.
In many places, people are playing a golden role in this movement in their own ways.
However, a young man of our country has carried out a very terrible movement.
When the milk of his work went to my attention, I used to call him and try to get to know about his new test.
For the first time when I heard this saying that I was planning, it was renewed to me.
Perhaps these words are more useful in foreign countries.
Hello, Ribudman, I salute Prime Minister Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore Indians have taken one step in this direction, India will move 130 crore feet in the direction of getting rid of the negligent substances used once.
Ributhman ji, once again, I thank you very much.
Moreover, thanks to you, and to your multitude, and to a new imagination of this kind.
Tengu.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the 2nd of October, but we want to travel on the path of Gandhiji's 150.
We want to transform our lives into a transformation in our country's health.
I would like to remind you of one thing in advance.
I will speak in detail about it in the next Mann Ki Baat, but why do I speak it just before today, don't you also have a chance to join the preparations for this
You will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji's birth anniversary.
Everybody, everybody, everybody, every school, every college, every thousands of people, every millions of villages in India, on that day we have to move towards unity.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that on 15th August, I had spoken to the Red Fort and I had been asking you to visit 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible, one or the other or the other must be organised to stay there.
Once again I request you to visit some 15 places in India, please visit some 15 places in India when people are coming to visit the festival of Deepavali.
This is because of your cooperation, especially when we understand the importance of tourism.
My heartfelt countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you for various festivals in a diverse India.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to interact with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Group's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper released a letter to the children in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India.
They published some selected letters in the magazine.
When I read those letters, they were good to me.
While appreciating the need for transformation of our educational system, Kirti Hecta, Northern Karnataka, he said that children have no country on class studies and are keen to understand the nature.
If we give information about nature to children, then there is a chance to be a catastrophe in natural security in the future.
The child, Rida Nataf, from Lakshmaswara, writes that he is the daughter of a military soldier and is proud of him.
There is no wonder if you are the daughters of the soldiers, you are proud of what Irfana Begum has written from Kalpurgi, his school is 5 kilometres from his village.
I am glad that a newspaper has taken such a summit and this letter has come to me and I have the opportunity to read it.
It was an experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is on 26th November.
Today, in 1949, the Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today, we are a memorable day for members of the Constitutional Legislature.
They tried to take 3 years to administer the Constitution of India.
Their dedication to the nation in those discussions is well known to those who read these discussions.
Do you know how hard they will work without a constitution for our diverse nation
They did this while the country was liberating from slaves with understanding and vision.
It is our obligation to create a New India, keeping in mind the clear ideas of those who have given the Constitution, with the brightness of this Constitution.
Our Constitution is very large.
There is no part of the life that does not seem to be visible and there is no thing about nature.
It is his obligation to all of us to follow without a single upheaval of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we must move forward by understanding the feelings of the Constitution.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that there is no part of anybody.
It is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day.
17 different groups were formed regarding the importance of the Constitution Council.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are feeling the pride of providing the Constitution of India, the unprecedented image of Babasaheb Ambedkar ji's dynamic leadership has been put in place.
He assured the benefits of all sections of society.
On the 6th of December, on his disappearance, we will always remember and pay homage to him as well.
Babasaheb's partnership in making the country self-reliant and powerful.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was the day.
Sardar Patel, who had transformed the iron man from the peasant's son, had done an extraordinary job to live the country in a single life.
Sardar ji was also a part of the Constitution.
He was a member of the original rights, minority and tribal consultation committee.
Although 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget 2611 happened 9 years ago
The country recalls and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police and the security forces.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is one of the world's widespread events today, some or the other happens every day and it happens in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our father-in-law has killed thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India spoke of terrorism on the global stage, when India took out the terror of terrorism, many people in the world did not take it seriously, but today the world governments are witnessing terrorism as a major challenge when terrorism lays down their doors.
This is aimed at destroying humanitarian forces.
Therefore, not only India but all humanitarian forces of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
The soil of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhiji gave this soil to the world of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are weakening our social system and making it a terrible effort.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be aware of humanity.
My dear countrymen, we are going to celebrate Navy Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our coastal areas.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Be it the Indus River, the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers, the sea, the economy and the war are both important.
This is our entrance to the entire world.
Their navy played a major role in the expansion of the Empire and making it a economic hostage.
Several examples of the naval invasions of the Christians and the research visits are still present in the Sankalp literature.
Most of the world's navy had spent a long time allowing women to work in the war.
However, about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the Navy of the Christians.
Women were also involved in the war.
There was a substantial technologies on shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, cannot President Shivaji Maharaj speak about the opening of his navy
The shores of Konkan, which were in the domination of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts related to the empire of Shivaji Maharaj, Sindh Durga, Murud Janjeera and Golden Turkey were situated on the seashore or surrounded by the sea.
The responsibility of the security of these forts is the Maratha army.
There were large ships and small ships in the Marathi Navy.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
Can you not talk about Kanoji Angre while talking about the Marathi Navy
He carried the Marathi naval to a new height and set up Marathi naval bases in many places.
Sumitra immediately engaged in rescue operations and saved many fishermen from drowning and surrendering to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our ship immediately reached there and damaged the government and the people of that country.
In June, when the Papua New Guinea government sent an emergency report to us, our navy helped in protecting fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country, to provide medical assistance to the country, to provide immediate relief and to bring humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries at the time of trouble.
We have always brought pride and pride to our defence forces, be it our navy or our navy, the bravery, bravery, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers are worthy of every citizen.
The lives of 125 crore Indians are due to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for their youth.
Every year, on 7th December, we are hosting the Army Flag Day.
All this week, they will hoist the flag on everyone that is small and big.
The movement of respecting the soldiers in the country will be launched.
We can distribute the flags of our soldiers on this occasion.
This fund is spent for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives in the war through the welfare of the soldiers.
You can learn about various ways of economic contribution.
Let us use this opportunity to work towards enhancing the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December, the World Soil Resource Day.
I want to tell our farmer brothers and sisters some things.
All the food we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food habits are connected to the earth.
Just imagine, if this wealthy soil is not available in the world, then think about what is it.
The trees don't sprout, how is human life possible
How are the microscopes
The farmers of this country are giving a lot of importance in their lives for both the things of devotion to the earth and for the sake of scientific conservation.
While the farmers of our country are attached to the heritage, it is also a matter of pride for us that they are attached to modern sciences, they are trying and motivated.
When I went to Boranj area of Tohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers have been using chemical fertilizers in the past, which has affected soil.
The production of soil was slowly decreasing and income was also decreasing.
In 2016-17, the cultivation of winter crops increased from 3 to 4 times per acre to 4 to 6 thousand rupees per acre.
Not only this, there was also a growth in the soil level.
Due to lack of use of fertilizer, economic savings also occurred.
It gave me great pleasure and my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them on the soil health cards and when they see the outcome, their enthusiasm increases.
If we have to pay attention to the masses, we should first take care of the earth, if we take care of the earth then we will be able to take care of all of us on this earth.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil cards so that they can understand their land properly.
We bow down to the earth, but have you ever seen how much harm she suffers from putting urea like fertilizers on her
It is proved in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a severe impact on urea being put on the earth.
When the farmer is the mother of the earth, how can he bear the burden of being sick on the earth
This parental relationship has to be reaware of once again.
Can our peasants, our mothers, our soil mates, be able to ensure that the urea that they use by 2022 will be decreasingly reduced after 75 years of independence
We have started feeling the world's heat and environmental change.
Before Deepawali, there was a time when the cold wave started.
However, even in such a situation, some examples are inspired by the fact that Sada is always aware.
Tushar, a 8-year-old child, who is a handicapped man in Madhya Pradesh, has tried to free his villagers from open defecation.
This young man, who is 8, cannot speak, but he has a weapon to be astonished
And he arose at 5 o'clock in the morning, and went to the house of his village, and smote them, and woke them up, and awakened them by signs, saying, Don't make open defecation.
Due to this young man who had given education for cleanliness at 30-40 houses every day, Kumbhari village was freed from open defecation.
This young man is working to inspire Tushar in the direction of cleanliness.
This shows that there is no age for cleanliness and there is no limit.
It is important for everyone to contribute to cleanliness, whether small or big, women or dancers.
You will also remember that our talented sportspersons have won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics and have completed the D-20 World Crickets for the blind.
Several competitions are going on throughout the country.
In the past, 17th National Rainfall Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young disabled brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and showed their capabilities.
One of them is a 19-year-old Jigger Dicker from Gujarat, though he does not have 80 percent of his body's muscles, look at his courage, mind and labour.
As a result of his capacity, he will be trained by the Sports Commission of India at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, as one of the 32 Para swimmers selected for the 20-20 Paralimpics.
I bow down to the young jigger duck, I extend my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being paid to the handicapped people for their access and opportunities.
A few days later, Id-e-Milat-Un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This is the day when the sovereign Hasrat Mohammad Saheb ji wrote.
(Pradhan Mantri ji, I am talking to waterja Singh from Kanpur.
I urge you to share with us ten best things that you have said in the voice of Mann Ki Baat this year.
Neither shall there be elders in our villages, neither shall they ever forget the grief, nor forget the grief.
We look at the past yearly accounts and take care of the ideas, and underscore these decisions and implement the plans for the next year.
We are once again trying to recall the interesting events of the last year in the media.
This includes a positive thing and a negative thing.
But when we take a step in 2018, we cannot remember only good things, do we not remember good things, do we not remember them
I tell you a suggestion that if you share 5-10 positive things that you have heard, you have seen, you have seen, you have no better feeling.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share 5 positive experiences in our lives this time
Whether it is a photograph or a small visual, we invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a clean environment and welcome you with good memories.
We will recall the events that inspire others.
We will create a better environment by recalling good things.
Good things provide energy to do good.
We will unite the strength and impact of this joint drive.
In my next voice of mind, I will surely work towards bringing things that have come to your positive India to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will return to you.
There will be a chance to exchange many things.
Seven days after the completion of Deepavali, Sath Puja is one of the festivals celebrated with several appointments and regulations.
Traditional appointments are followed in every matter of what to eat and what to do.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The house is cleaned before the Satpura and all are engaged in the cleanliness of rivers, lakes, waterways, pilgrimage and pilgrimage.
Surya Puja or Sath-Puja is a celebration of environmental protection, disease relief and regulation.
The feeling of destruction of humanity is behind this tradition that pursues extremism, which can be a major hurdle in the path of progress.
It is natural that this great heritage of India is all proud.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is praised and criticised.
Let us take the examples of doors and handicrafts.
I am happy to hear that only one shop is selling so much.
On the occasion of Deepawali, about 680 percent of the growth has been registered in the Kati Prize sales.
The total sale of ears and handicrafts is around 90 percent.
Today, it shows that the youth, the elderly, the women, all the adults want to wear garments and handlooms.
I can imagine how many negative families, the poor families and the families of those working in handloom.
Shri Narendra Modi App has written that you should share my experience of Deepawali among the security forces and how they celebrate Deepawali.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
In my case, this time Deepawali also brought a great experience.
Once again, we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepawali with our unhappy defence forces on the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience to carry Deepawali to the security forces in the Kurez area of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our defence forces are protecting the country, I salute all our defence forces on behalf of all the nations for that struggle, dedication and sacrifice, facing the extremely difficult and difficult situations across the border.
Whenever we have the opportunity, we have to understand the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventurous activities.
Many of us don't know that our defence forces are not only engaged in our borders but also in several important works to maintain peace all over the world.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that India is proud of all over the world.
In terms of ourselves, we are following the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, a family all over the world.
India has always been pressurizing women's equality.
It is generally known as a small change in India, but it reflects a smooth thought.
In terms of various works of India, it is a major part of India.
India has always played a positive role in the peacekeeping activities of the United Nations.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served around 50 in 71 peacekeeping activities across the world.
These operations have taken place in all parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
India's military in Kango and South Sudan has provided treatment to more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Some people would know that India was the first country to send the first female guardian group through the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in Liberia.
This activity of India is a sympathy for all the world.
After this, all countries started sending their women's guards.
It is a matter of great pride to all that Indias contribution is not only with peacekeeping activities, but India is also engaged in training those engaged in the peacekeeping work of around 85 countries.
Our tyranny peacekeepers from this land of Gandhiji and Gaudhambud have brought the message of establishing peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping activities are not easy.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
There is a need to live in different people.
There is a need to understand different situations and different cultures.
They have to change themselves in accordance with regional proposals and environment.
When you look at him, the hearts of all the people of the country are glorified by the pride of the same II awarded by Paramveer Chakra.
In 1989, the 72-year-old man was appointed as a force commander in Namibia and dedicated his services to ensuring Namibia's independence.
India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as an angel of peace.
Though he was born as a Market Elizabeth Disease in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him 'Nivedita'.
Nivedita means that he is completely devoted.
In the following period, he dedicated himself according to his name.
Sister Nivedita's 150th birth anniversary yesterday.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda, cut off his happy life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita suffered mentally from the injustices that the British ruled.
The British have not only slaughtered our country, but also tried to keep us slaves in mind.
The work of humiliating our culture has been going on in our minds.
Sister Nivedita re-established the glory of India culture.
He raised the awareness of the country and worked to unite the people.
He went to different countries of the world and shouted against the misinterpretation of peaceful religions and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet, Subramanian Bharati, who is a revolutionary innovator, explains the equilibrium of the New Yuga Pendor and their synonymous balance.
It is said that he got the inspiration from his sister's representative.
Bhai Nivedita has helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Poshu.
He has collaborated through his articles and conferences to propagate and extend Bose's research.
Accomplishment of spiritual and science is one of the many beautiful features of India.
Brother Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose are the best examples of this.
In 1899, there was a terrible Black disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Sister Nivedita didn't have anything to do with her health and started the work of cleaning the canals and streets.
He might have lived a comfortable life, but he was engaged in the service of the poor.
He was inspired by his sacrifice and began to make his contribution to public service.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
When asked if children are also suffering from diabetes, they are very surprised.
These diseases are called syphilis in the early days, if syphilis is a disease then these diseases are rich and only those who live in comfort.
Such diseases were rarely seen in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know that these diseases are a lifestyle disorder.
One of the important reasons for this kind of diseases in young age is the reduction in physical activity in our lifestyle and changes in food habits.
It is also important to focus on society and family.
If you think about this, you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
We must change our old habits, do small things properly and make it naturally.
The people of the family should make efforts to play in the open fields.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these kids in sports.
Children can have a habit of climbing stairs instead of using Liftup.
After dinner, everyone in the family can walk with the children.
Yoga is very beneficial in creating a healthy lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorders, especially in our youngsters.
Before starting the school, you will see how much benefit you will get from yoga for 30 minutes.
Why do I say that it is easier to learn and why it is very simple, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific instruments or fields.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes, many researches have been conducted.
The AIMS hospital is being reviewed and it is very inspiring to see the outcome so far.
We will not only see Ayurveda and Yoga as mere treatments but also make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, many good news has come in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our soldiers have played a very excellent role, so we have been able to make Asian Corps successful after decades.
Earlier, India had won Asian Corps in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the whole team, to the helpers, and to the people of the country.
After Hockey, India has got good jobs in Betminton's games.
The bedminding star, Kidambi Srikanth, won the Denmark Open and honoured India.
After Indonesia Opin and Australia's Opin Treasury, this is the third super-series premiere.
I extend my best wishes to our young sportspersons and their achievements for honouring India.
Friends, this month FIFA has started World Cup competitions for 17 years of age.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everybody showed their capabilities in the foothills.
I had the opportunity to see a flock.
The sportspersons and audience were encouraging everyone.
The world is taking care of a great event called the World Cup.
He was surprised to see such a great joy, the strength, enthusiasm and thirst of all the youngsters.
The World Cup successfully began and all the teams showed their capabilities excellently.
Though India could not have succeeded, India's young sportspersons won the breasts of all the people.
All the countries, including India, have visited this massive event and have attracted and enjoyed the entire banquet.
The symptoms of the future of the footwear are very bright.
Once again, I congratulate all the sportspersons and those who helped them and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, when I look at the number of writers regarding Swachh Bharat, I have to pay honour to their sentiments, I must dedicate the voice of every man to cleanliness.
Some send photographs about the efforts of small boys, some send information about the youth's team's efforts.
In some places, some innovations are being initiated on cleanliness or somebody gets information about the changes made by an official's drive.
I was given a detailed statement in the past about a revival story in the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
There, a government organisation called Ecological Protection Organization was engaged in the cleaning of Chandrapur fort through its entire team.
In this movement that lasted for 200 days, they were engaged in the work of purification of the fort without slept.
Regularly 200 days.
Your disappointment and confidence will be made by seeing this.
This pious effort for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, social activity and interim effort.
The fort is a symbol of our tradition.
It is our countrymen who have the responsibility of protecting and cleaning historical heritage.
I extend my warm greetings to the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we are going to celebrate Guru Nanak's birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji became not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also a Guru of the world.
He thought of the benefits of the entire human society, and he served all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message to establish equality in society, not only with words but also with his actions.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has conveyed 3 messages to the beneficiaries of livelihood - uplifting the name of Lord, working and helping the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji passed a sacred scripture called Guru Granth to take his teachings.
We are going to celebrate the upcoming 2019 as the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us try to move forward on the path of his teaching and showcasing.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October after two days.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's specialty is that he was not just a manifestative of the idea of change, but was able to fulfil its procedure, even if it erupted as a very difficult problem.
He was a specialist in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji assumed the great responsibility of connecting India with a single line.
At the outset, he ensured that millions of people should be brought under the guise of the One Nation One Constitution.
His ability to make a resolution has empowered him to pass all the sanctions.
This word of Sardar ji is still a sensitivity to our New India, and even today it is worthy.
That is why we celebrate his birth anniversary as National Integration Day.
His contribution to a coordinated form of the nation is unlikely.
On 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar ji's birth anniversary, many people are going to participate in the run of unity across the country, including children, youth, women and all age groups.
I urge you also to join this run for unity and join the mutually beneficial programme.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, you all have started resuming your daily life with a new commitment and a new commitment.
My best wishes to all of you for fulfilling your dreams.
It's been three years since we started talking to you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat in Akashwani.
Today, 36th segment.
In a way, there are allegations of the creative power of India, the feelings, desires and expectations that are filled in all corners of the country, but I have a unique opportunity to interact with the feelings of the people.
You must have noticed that I have never said that this is the voice of my mind.
Be it e-mail or telephone, be it MyGov or Narendra Modi App, all these are available to me.
Sometimes individual-related disorders and sometimes social problems are attracting attention.
I take about half an hour of yours once a month, but people are sending me information about the voice of Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the people of the country for getting the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have always reminded me of the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Thereafter, there was a lot of letters from everywhere in the country and many social organizations and many youths were engaged in the work without food.
While watching, not only in India, but also from all over the world, Cellie has been translated into a big movement.
This is not the problem of social media.
Every woman has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
Every mother had to take a cell with her daughter.
Every woman has a feeling that she has its own importance.
In the past, I attended a meeting of the tourism sector of the Government of India.
I urge the travellers to send me pictures of Incredible India wherever you travel.
Millions of films have come from every corner of India and in a way it has become a big wealth for the workers in the tourism sector.
Every moment the country is on the right path.
Every citizen of the country is trying to do something positively for the welfare of others, for the benefit of society and for the progress of the country.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I got to know and learn from the people of the country.
This is a big capital for any country.
The sale of doors has increased due to which employment has increased in poor households.
From 2nd October onwards, it is a substantial shift to doorsteps.
I once again urge you to take forward the movement on the doorsteps and strengthen it.
When we buy doors, we have to keep in mind the feeling that the Deepavali is bright in the houses of the poor.
We must do this because of this activity that the poor of our country gets strength.
Due to the growing interest in the doorsteps, there has been an inspiration and inspiration for those working in the doorsteps, in the Government of India, to those associated with the doorsteps.
The idea of how to use new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to introduce solar equipment.
They have started thinking about how to revive the tradition that has been hidden from the law for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Kadi Ashram of Varanasi was closed for 26 years, which has now started working with a new dimension.
That is, 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on 2nd October, we have decided to take part in the Swachh Bharat across the country.
We will unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated this work and the nation united it.
Today, all the elders and children, men and women, city-village are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness drive.
I had promised that we will succeed and this cleanliness movement is moving towards achieving success with the help of our commitment and is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it suitable for them, helping them, making a golden contribution to achieve this.
The sportspersons, students, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, workers, police and soldiers are all connecting themselves with this movement.
If the people are laying the layers of the public, there is a kind of pressure on the workers to keep it clean and I am feeling good.
This time I had to pay attention to the other thing - cleanliness is one thing, we don't waste from awakening.
At the same time, cleanliness is our nature and it is important to implement an ideal movement.
This time many competitions related to Swachh Hi Seva were held.
More than 12 crore children participated in the articles.
Thousands of children took their imagination and paintings.
When we talk about cleanliness, I do not forget to express my gratitude to the media.
They have taken this movement with a very clean feeling.
They have contributed a bigger role in making a positive environment by connecting them with everybody's fitness.
We are witnessing how big service is being made to the Swachh Hi Seva Mission in our country's e-Media and newspapers.
A few days ago, a 18-year-old young man from Srinagar told me about Bilal Dar.
The Asian largest lake is near Srinagar, wherein he used to cover plastic, polythene, utilized bottles and huts.
From this, he also earned.
As his father died of cancer, he added his livelihood to cleanliness.
Bilal Dar is a young man, but is an inspiration and a source of inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
This October is a month to remember many of our people.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11th of October, Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Din Dayal Upadhyay ji.
This year has been centuries for Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
On the occasion of his centenary celebrations, it is important to proud of his work on rural development that Nanaji Deshmukh ji had dissolved political life and connected him with the village movement.
The former President of India, Abdul Kalam, will always present the issues of Nanaji Deshmukh ji's rural progress when he interacts with the youth.
He will also visit the villages to see Nanaji's work.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji will also speak in detail about the man in the middle of the society.
Deen Dayal ji recalls how to transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, and the underprivileged, into education and employment.
If we look at all these men, we dont have the right to do them, why do we look at these men then we go ahead and go ahead.
In every city of the country, this kind of iron iron is required to be run on a large scale and the weather is comfortable.
Sardar ji did not unite the country
We also have to participate in this drive for unity and move forward the mantra of unity.
We are very natural to say that unity in diversity is Indias achievement.
While we are proud of diversity, did you try to feel this diversity
I would like to repeat to the people of the country, especially to the younger generations, that we are with our lives.
Enjoy the diversity of our India, feel it, observe its smell.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the development of your individuality.
During the holidays, during the Diwali, there has been a feeling of going somewhere around our country.
The people of North India do not know what is in South India.
The people living in the West are unaware of what is in the East India.
Do you know how many diversity is in our country
If you have listened to the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam, one thing will be seen well - when they visited India, there was a new inspiration to see India and to dedicate their lives.
All these men have visited India completely.
Before their operations, they tried to understand and understand India.
They tried to see India live within themselves.
Can not our different states, various communities, groups, their customs, their traditions, their traditions, their traditions, their food habits and their beliefs be learned as a student, understanding and living
It is the value of tourism that we understand as a student, and not stop watching and standing.
I have the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of Integrated India is unprecedented.
How many types of food habits
If you have every kind of food every day in your entire life then there is no chance of eating the same food again.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should go out of the house and not stop going to change, but go out with the aim of knowing and stopping things.
Your life will be fulfilled through these experiences.
Your vision will be expanded.
Say, who can be more than your experiences
If you go this time, you will be able to take my movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share pictures.
Definitely send your photographs to Uncredibly Antiania.
If you want to meet the people there then send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind - what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state to encourage tourism in India - if every Indian has to know about the seven places of your state, then he should go to those seven places.
With the help of this, can you give any information about this
Can you show this at the Narendra Modi App
Can you know this in Incredible India
I would like to tell the government to release advertising cards on which seven places have been reported in every state, if some of the people from a state say so.
I mean, how can you take the tourist places forward in a way with the ideas of people
Similarly, you can imagine that the places you have seen all over the country, where you have 7 best places, where you have to see, wherever you have to go, you can imagine that you have to get information about these seven places you like to send to MyGov and Narendra ModiApp.
Come on, join me.
During this period from October to March, you may be able to encourage the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
Our countrymen, many things touch my mind as a human being.
I'm a man like you
The events that took place in the past may have come to your attention - the people of the country will have seen the magnificent example of women's strength and patriotism.
The Indian Army has two vessels - Lieutenant Tasty and Financial - which are extraordinary homes.
If I say that they are extraordinary, they have lost their lives in the service of Mother India.
You can imagine how their mindset will be when the world breaks down at this young age.
But Tawati Mahathik, wife of the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahathik, confronted such a difficult situation and strengthened his mind and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army and took himself to realise his husband's dream.
Likewise, Financial Tubey's husband, Mahesh Tubey, was working as a narrator in the army, slaughtered his life in the work of motherland, his wife, Financial, insisted on joining the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will have respect for this mother power and our irony.
My dear countrymen, during the Navaratri Festival and Deepawali, there is a great opportunity for the youth of our country.
FIFA and the World Cup for 17 years of age is going to be held here.
I believe that there will be a footprint all around.
Each generation will enhance interest in footwear.
Everybody should be involved in this game so that there are no youth who don't play a footstep in the field of any school and college in India.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when all the world is playing on Indian soil.
My dear countrymen, Navaratri is going on.
This is the time to worship Mother Durga.
The atmosphere is shocked by the sacred joy.
There is a spiritual ecosystem, a festival environment and a devotional environment all around
On this auspicious occasion of Navaratri, I convey my best wishes to the people of the country and I urge the mother Parashakti to fulfil the wishes and aspirations of the common man of the country and take the country to new heights.
The nation must get the opportunity to face every challenge.
When India is 75 years after its independence in 2022, we have to move ahead with the spirit of the 125 crore people, the instinctive labour, the unbearable energy and the minds of the 125 crore people, the mothers and sisters, we have to move forward with the blessings of a New India.
My best wishes to all of you.
Engage in the celebrations, spread the tunes.
This country is the birthplace of Buddha and Gandhi, the birthplace of Sardar Patel, who is fully associated with the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors, usually, have been proud of the living standards and non-violence, in our minds.
And Ahimsa said to Paramodharma, We have heard this word from the beginning of our child, and have said.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitations and dressing clothes
This diversity appears in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been set up in accordance with the list of nature.
All of them are directly connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are related to farmers and fishermen.
Today, when I talk to you about the festivals, I would like to say that Michami is sorry to all of you.
The Jains celebrated Samvatsari yesterday.
Parushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is the last day of Parushan celebrations.
This is a wonderful tradition.
The day of Samvatsari is a reference to forgiveness, imagination and friendship.
This celebration is considered to be the symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the people of the country.
Now Oanam Festival is celebrated in Kerala.
Onam Festival of Kerala is one of the most important festivals of India.
Our festivals are now a source of attraction for tourism.
I would like to tell the people that the Navaratri Festival in Gujarat, the Durga Festival in Bengal, is a way to attract tourism.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in this direction.
The festival will be attended in a few more days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be a cause for cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are connected to family life.
Being ready for the festival is focusing on cleanliness.
Although this is not a new thing for us, it is important to transform it into a social nature.
They put colors in them, one puts green colors and one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is doing different kinds of gains.
In a way, the biggest exercise of ecosystem awareness has been seen for the first time in this Ganesha festival.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta Mission and will complete three years from 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 percent from 39 percent.
The best example of insisting on unity in the cause of cleanliness is that the people of the Jamiat Ulema A Hindu system have shown an example of not inspiring everyone.
If the efforts of cleanliness, dedication and dedication have become our constant nature, then it cannot be achieved by our country.
We will find out where we will get the opportunity and where we will get the opportunity.
But we all have to join it.
We consider this as a preparation before Deepawali, a preparation for Navaratri or a preparation for Durga Puja.
We will serve physically.
We will work together on holidays or Sundays.
We go to nearby areas and go to nearby villages but we can do all this as a movement.
I urge all government organisations, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district rulers and Panchayat leaders - 15 days before Gandhiji's birth anniversary on 2nd October, we will create a cleaner environment, this must be indeed an October 2 dream of Gandhiji.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of the toilet, you can register your name and the name of those whom you have assisted to set up a toilet.
My socio-economic friends can drive out some positive movements and ensuring work on the ground.
Competitions on Swachhta Abhiyan are being organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation to compete in the movement organized by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, competitiveness and paintings.
You can write in many languages and there is no age.
You can manufacture a marble, you can manufacture it on your mobile phone.
It should be a 2-3-minute short film and it should be inspiring for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
When we celebrate this Swachhta Hi Seva Mission for 15 days, on 2nd October, see how clean it will be when we have given to the salute Gandhiji.
Millions of people write letters, give information, many are telephone reports, which is a huge wealthy platform for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of the people of the country.
The more you wait for the voice of mind, the more I wait for the news of you.
I am thirsty because everything of yours gives me a chance to learn.
Yeah, I'm also making such a mistake.
Sometimes we don't even speak about how much things change ourselves.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Pune to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but her action makes me unhappy.
Once I went to the business premises to buy things with her.
He spent 2000 rupees without any trouble buying a plant, and then spent 450 rupees and bought beeds
But the auto driver used to come to the campus was intensified at a cost of Rs. 5.
When he bought the vegetables on the way back, he spoke at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I have a lot of trouble.
We buy goods without asking any questions in big places, fighting for small money to our brothers and sisters who are working hard.
After asking this phone call, I am confident that you might have been sorry and you might be convinced that why would you not walk like this now
Have you ever seen what is going on in the mind of the poor
My young friends, on August 29, the entire country is going to celebrate the sports day.
This is Hockey sportsperson and Major Dayanchand ji's birth anniversary, which is considered to be the majesty of the Hockey world.
His contribution to Hockey is unlikely.
I recall this thing because the youth of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports should be a part of our lives.
As we are a young country in the world, we must reflect in these young sports grounds.
What is more important than that, the sports provides physical activity, awakening mind and governance.
Sports is one of the closest links to minds.
I urge the younger generations of our country to move forward in the world of sports and also to say that todays calculation is more important than the sports grounds and computer sports in the world.
Everything can be played by FIFA's footsteps in the compilation, but I am watching the footsteps in the field.
You can play cricket in the calculations, but in the field, play under the sky, its joy is different.
Sometimes when all the children go out of the house, the mother asked when you're back.
If this changes in today's era, when the children come home, sit on a corner, start watching cartoon films or drown in mobile camps
Any child in the country who has achieved some achievement in the field of sports, if they have the capability, they can provide details or videos about them in this port.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected and growing sportspersons and will start this portal tomorrow.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, FIFA has organised a World Care Cup for 17 years of age.
24 teams from all over the world are coming to India.
Let us welcome young social guests from many countries through sports events and we will experience sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I would like to exchange it with you in the last weeks.
Six such women are employed in the Navy.
Their sentiments and their inspiration are inspiring to all of us.
These six women's wealth are traveling to a small boatman INS TARINI and trying to cross the sea.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, i. e.
They will roam around the world and return to India after several months.
Sometimes it will spend about 40 days in the water.
Sometimes about 30 days must be spent in water.
This is the first time in the world that our 6 women travel through the waves of the sea with courage.
I also create a way for their experiences in the Narendra Modi App and you are organizing a study.
You must read it because I am happy to share the experiences of this woman's wealth with you, such a brave story, a self-reliant story.
My best wishes and good wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate the Teachers' Day on 5th September.
Former President of our country, Dr.
This is Radhakrishnan's birth anniversary.
Though he was the President, he had made himself an architect throughout his life.
He always wanted to live a young man.
He was dedicated to education.
As a lawyer, as a prince, he was the President of India, but he lived every moment.
I remember him.
This time, when we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we all make a commitment together
As a result of his efforts, the events that have succeeded in transforming the lives of every teacher will certainly be in the lives of every teacher.
If we try socially, we can transform the country and we can play a bigger role in it.
Let us learn to see change, let us take this mantra forward.
Ananya Austi.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As an observer, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that you have started your programme in 2014 and if India is more secure than financially, whether it is increasing, whether this power and facilities have increased our women, the farmers, the workers, the villages and the leaflets.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been heard and financial inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the economy around the world.
On August 28, 2014, I started this project with a dream in my mind.
On August 28, this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched and will be completed for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been opened.
This is a greater number than that of many countries in the world.
Sometimes, if the money is supplied in the hand or in the bag or in the house, the mind will be inspired to spend the house.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65,000 crore has been deposited in banks through our poor.
In a way, the savings of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Those who have opened bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will also get insurance benefits.
Today, a new hope has been created in the lives of those poor people by paying a very simple fee of Rs. 1 rupee and Rs.
In many families, if the poor gets a complication, if the family leader dies, then the family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start Up Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, be it underprivileged or tribal, be it women, be it educated or educated youth, and be it youngsters living in their own footsteps, crores of such youths have been provided without any bonds from banks under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
They stand not only on their own legs but also on successful efforts to provide jobs to one or two people.
When some people from the bank sector came to meet me in the last few days, they told them that when they had done a study on how the benefits of the common man have been made due to Jan Dhan Yojana, Insurance Schemes, RuPay Cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, they have got many inspiring things.
I will take all my efforts to bring them to your sight.
These include events that can be fully utilized by media.
They can also interact with such people and create a new vision for a new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again, Michami is sad for all of you.
English rendering of the text of PMs address at the Indian Radio in Agil today.
The rainy season is a time to observe the minds of the people.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all grow on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain is very heavy, we know how much destruction you have.
Nature is the mother of the mother who blossoms our lives, develops us all, but sometimes natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and their demand forms are more harmful.
Changing climate and environmental change have adverse effects.
For the past few days, natural disasters had to be faced in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
Complete monitoring measures are being taken in the flood affected areas.
The state governments are also making efforts to help those affected by floods in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also doing their best to help the people in this situation.
As a result, cattle wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In particular, in order to ensure the loss of our farmers and their crops, we have been implementing the schemes for survival of insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, to quickly meet the demand for loss of farmers.
At the same time, 1078 has been fully operational for 24 hours to deal with the floods.
People are expressing their pains in this regard.
Before the rainy season, the entire government machine was prepared to conduct a training campaign in the majority areas.
The National Disaster Response Forces were pulled out.
They were trained in the field of disaster-free organisations, what to do, what to do, what to do, how to determine the autonomous, how to create a people's organisation and how to work in such a situation.
Nowadays the weather has already been calculated, technology has grown more, space science has played a major role in calculating it, which makes us approximately the right calculation.
Gradually, according to the climate calculation, we have to change our nature to build our activities and prevent the impact of disasters.
Whenever I am preparing for the Mann Ki Baat, I can see the people of our country engaged in the preparation of it.
This time there have been a lot of letters and phone calls on GST
Even today, people have expressed their happiness over this goods and services and have expressed their expectations.
Listen to this telephone call: Salute, Prime Minister, I am talking to Kurgavan, that is, from Gurugram.
As a month passed, are you expected to have the consequences
I would like to know your thoughts about this, thank you.
The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax has been almost a month and its results have started to come to light.
I see how this new infrastructure has affected the transport and services sector.
The goods are also moving faster.
In spite of this facility, it has particularly strengthened the economic pace.
As a result of the first separate taxation, the majority of the transport and services sector had passed through the maintenance of resources and documents, every state had to set up a new settlement for its own.
This tax, which I say is good and easy tax, has actually had a very positive impact on our economy in a very short span of time.
The speed at which changes have been made, the speed at which new changes have been made, new records have been recorded, all these have created a new confidence throughout the country.
In many of the world universities, this is a model study.
Because such a big change, with the help of crores of people, the successful implementation of this system in such a big country can be considered as the highest success.
ST
All States have a share and responsibility in implementing the Act.
All the decisions and decisions have been taken in a unanimous manner in collaboration with the Central Government.
What was the price of one thing that was mentioned by the App before this reconstruction and how it was after the new reconstruction, all are available on your mobile phone.
This is a historic success, a success.
This is also a social reform movement in a way.
I offer my dedication to crores of people and crores of people who have made such a big effort naturally successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August marks the revolution.
Obviously we have heard about this thing since childhood and this is the reason for the introduction of the Cooperation Mission in August 1, 1920.
And then on August 9, 1942, the uit India Movement began and we know that this is a August Revolution.
Next August, 1947, the country was freed.
In one way, many events of August are specially associated with freedom history.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But he pretended to get out of this white.
Some people knew Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generations must know what happened in August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we have to inspire all the historical aspects of the country to build a honourable India, in which the people of the country enthusiastically joined themselves in the roots of freedom, bound them and tolerated oppression.
What else can be a greater imagination than the sacrifices, sacrifices and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is the most important movement of India's freedom movement.
This struggle gave the whole country a commitment to get rid of the British regime.
During that period, the British joined the shoulder to shoulder with every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, readers, uneducated, poor and rich, and participated in the fight against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the height.
Millions of people have listened to Gandhiji's chariot and took the mantra of Chetumdi in my mind and in front of the struggle.
Millions of youngsters of the country have sacrificed their teachings and books on the basis of independence.
The sanctum sanctorum of independence was sounded and they went ahead.
Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan have played an important role in human beings.
The Cooperation Mission of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942 brightens two different corners of Gandhiji.
The dimension of collaboration was different and in 1942, a man like Gandhiji had to put forward the mantra of kare or dying.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1857, continued every week till 1942 in some part of the country.
This long-term period had created a freedom struggle in the breasts of the countrymen.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Traditions have changed, but there is no depression in stress.
People continued to come, engaged themselves, went, went, and new people came, they joined themselves, took away the British regime and tried to make a lot of efforts in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new situation, which took the situation to a height of 1942.
When Sangannatha shouted that he had to leave the country in 1947, within five years.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom struggle had reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were the reasons for the freedom of the nation.
These five years are their determined years.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today we are in 2017.
Nearly 70 years have passed.
The governments have arrived.
Organisations have grown, have changed, have grown and grown.
Everybody tried to get rid of the country from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment, eradicate poverty and develop in the country.
Efforts were made on their own ways.
He also got successes.
We must celebrate 15th August this year as well as 2022 as 75 years of our independence.
On August 9, in the memory of the Revolutionary Day of 125 crore people, on August 15, everybody will be sure that I will do this to the country as a person and as a citizen, as a family, as a society, as a city, as a government sector and as a government.
Millions of people must be serving.
Efforts should be made to fulfil such promises.
Just as it has been a decisive year for five years from 1942 to 1947, we must work together for five years from 2017 to 2022 to determine the future of India.
We are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of independence five years later.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisations, schools, colleges, various organisations, we will take some pledge to create a New India.
May it be a pledge to make our commitment to succeed in the next five years.
What goal should we reach as a country
What can be my contribution as a person
Come forward with the use of technology, with the use of technologies, telephones, posts, plaques and new ideas.
Let us make this movement a mass movement.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi App will compete for young social friends, if they don't get out of white.
The competition of this question is an attempt to connect youngsters with the glorious history of the country and to understand the heroes of freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread and spread this message well.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country on 15th August.
I'm an instrument.
I read them and on 15th August I will try to express them as long as I have.
Accusation was made before me that the speeches of the last three times were a little longer on August 15.
I am trying to fulfil the rules and I do not know whether I can do it.
But I am supposed to try this time how to briefly commence my speech.
Whether or not I have succeeded in this.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk to you about another thing.
India's economy consists of a social economy.
We should never underestimate it.
Our festivals and our celebrations are not just an opportunity for joy.
Our festivals and celebrations are also a movement for social redevelopment.
But at the same time, each of our festivals has a direct connection with the economic life of the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then the kids square, then Saud Chandra, and Ananth square, Durga Puja and Deepawali are coming together.
They connect individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah Sey, that is, I am an opportunity to move from that level to that level.
As a economic situation, even months before the Raksha Bandhan Festival, many families have started making rocks as a small dwelling industry.
Several types of rocks are being constructed from cotton to silk.
But today people have started seeking more rocks made at home.
It has a direct connection with the poor handicrafts manufacturing small fire lights.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I want to make it clear about the environment.
Sometimes I see that the people of the country are more aware and positive than me.
Since last one month, awakening citizens are writing letters to me regarding the environment.
You people have asked me to talk about the environment-friendly children before Chaturthi, and to increase the desires of the children on the ground and to plan from now on.
For the first time, I express my gratitude to those awakening citizens.
At the same time, it is our commitment to create threads of soil-made children in order to protect the environment.
This time I have already said
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen, for the coming various festivals and celebrations.
A few days ago, our women and women have performed a massive role in the cricket World Cup.
This week I got the opportunity to meet all of them.
I was very happy to interact with them, but I felt that they were pressing the burden that they could not win the world cup.
The pressure on their faces, the crisis was buried.
I gave a different assessment on my behalf to those women.
See, today's era is the media world, the expectations have increased, the number of successes have not been achieved, it turns into anger
If India's sportspersons have failed then we have seen the anger of the country shouting at those sportspersons in many sports.
They lauded the achievements of these women and honoured them.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially the women, are engaged in many things in the pride of the nation.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the youth, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country to new heights and take it to new heights.
Come, let us travel together, let us travel by doing something.
We will move ahead with the belief that the future of the country will certainly be excellent.
My best wishes.
Climate is changing.
After the rains, the cold wind has slightly breathed from the heat of summer in the past.
Whatever the people face in life, however the crisis, we feel that individual life, in public life, in the arrival of rain, there is a better change in the mindset of all of us.
Lord Jagannath is connected to the poorest of the country with spirituality.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, there is a word of juggernaut, which means that nobody can stop it.
On seeing Agarathi, it was known that this Jagannath ji's chariot was built.
When we see all this, we can understand how the people of the world have accepted this greatness in their own ways.
On the occasion of the journey of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all the nations and bow down to Lord Jagannath.
Come, let us all together inspire this holy festival and share the treasure of satisfaction and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this sacred month of Ramlan, we have come to the notice of a great seminar from Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Islamic brothers and sisters living with their families in this small village and there are a large number of brothers and sisters of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, all the villagers had decided to build toilets together.
That's why you have asked to spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this sacred occasion of Ramlan for social welfare.
We know that the states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Haryana has been declared Open Defecation Free States.
I express my gratitude to the administration, rulers and the public of these five states.
We are grateful that if we want to do some good individual life or social life then we must work hard.
If we think that if our signatures are bad then we have to do it, then we must try to do it with a lot of awakening.
That is why it will become a habit of physical and mentality.
Similarly, some other bad habits have become natural.
We must attract everyone's attention.
We must recall the events that are inspiring.
I am glad that cleanliness is not at the level of the government today.
This has been transformed into a movement of the people's society.
This happened in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What's its goal
In 100 hours, 10,000 households have been constructed in 71 gram panchayats.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to note that the people and the government have succeeded in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
(in) are coming through letters and through aeroplanes.
He recalled the emergence and said that on June 25, the history of democracy was the greatest.
Awareness of Prakash Tripadhi ji is commendable and democracy is not just an organisation but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of the democratic system.
On June 25, 1975, it was a dark night, and no one can forget it easily.
No Indian can leave it.
All the major leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned.
Today, the students of the media world and all those who work in the democratic form have been working to remind them of the brave period and they have to continue to make aware.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
When an emergency was announced in the country, Atal ji wrote a poem, describing the atmosphere in the country during that period.
We must make this tradition more committed.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian is proud of his head.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world was Yoga.
All the people from the water to the mountain were welcomed by the sun rays and yoga in the morning.
Yoga has not been earlier, but today everyone is associated with Yoga, Yoga has become a bridge to connect the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have turned the opportunity to provide Yoga to them.
More than 4,000 people in Abutabi of the United Arab Emirates were engaged in yoga at the height of 2400 metres above the sea level in Machu Bichu, the world heritage symbol of China and the country.
In Hyderabad, Afghanistan, India was an Afghan partner in the Salma Dam and made a new endeavour for friendship.
Even at a smaller place like Singapore, the events were organised in 70 places and they had launched this movement for a week.
This time again Yoga has achieved the world.
In Ahmedabad, about 55 thousand people have worked together and have achieved a new world.
I also got the opportunity to do yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time in the rainy season, it was also a good opportunity for Yoga.
Our soldiers were engaged in Yoga art even in Siachen, a temperature of 20, 25 and 40 degrees.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Central Reserve Police Forces and Central Industrial Security Forces, all have committed their obligations and engaged in yoga training.
As this is the third International Day of Yoga, I had requested the family members of three generations to take a film of Yoga and share with me.
Some television channels also took this matter forward.
Many of them have sent photographs to me and some of them have been selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Dr.
Anil Sonara speaks.
Yes, I recall your recent statement in Kerala that instead of blooming at various places, we have given good books as a memorial.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea across the country.
I liked it very much.
I am reminded of a thing that escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we had created a way to give no more smokes, to give books or to welcome them.
We will also give the doorsteps because it can encourage the doorsteps.
While I was in Gujarat, it had become a habit, but after coming from there, this habit has become free.
But when I went to Kerala, I was once again aware.
But when we give books, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
You know how much helpful it is to the poor, even if we give thresholds.
Expenditure deficit is also used in the right way.
These things have a historic significance.
When I went to UK last year, the UK queen Elizabeth had taken me to the council in London city.
When he brightened his eyes, when I was married, Gandhiji congratulated me and expressed his feeling that he had presented this handloom.
For many years, Elizabeth queen had kept the handcuffs offered by Gandhiji.
A small love of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits don't turn into nights, while speaking like this, criticisms have to be ruled.
At the same time, such interactions should be held and efforts should be made.
For this, whenever I go somewhere, I don't deny anybody's blooming, I can't do that.
We must repeat the criticism and gradually change.
My dear countrymen, there are several initiatives as the Prime Minister of the country.
Even if I have to be covered in the crows, I am making a habit, that is, reading some of the letters that come to me, I am setting a chance to connect with the common man.
Several types of letters come and many different people write to me.
I feel that it is necessary to share with you a letter that I read a few days ago.
Therefore, under the Mudra Yojana, I have started taking money from the bank and buying some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, my focus was on the establishment of the Government of India e-Marketplace and the Government of India.
Those who want to give something to the government - if they want to sell anything like electricity bulbs, pipelines, pipelines, chairs and tables then they can register themselves on this basis.
He is compulsory to take stock of the quality of goods that he can sell at the cost and the government departments should go to this base and take care of who provides affordable and quality goods.
All the departments of the government are looking after who is registering in the e-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at cheap prices.
This is an opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
This includes brightness and empowerment, including entrepreneurship.
I want to register all those people who want to sell their goods to the government in a big way on this website.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, the achievements that we have made in space sciences are also reflecting our breasts.
India's greatest specialty is that while our footsteps are standing on the earth connected with yoga, we are fulfilling the dream of touching the far-reaching applications.
In the past, India has made a big achievement in sports or science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on the planet.
Two days ago, the Indian Space Research Institute (ISRO) has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites.
Besides India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
The Nano Satellite Mission of India will help in getting information related to agriculture and natural calamities.
In our scientific journey, it is an important milestone in our space journey.
We can see that our youth are progressing in the sports sector.
Besides education, they understand that they have their future in sports.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, India's Patminton Sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth ji has won the Indonesia Open Convention and honoured the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his parents for this achievement.
D.
Sports play a major role in the development of overall governance.
There is no shortage of skills in the country.
If children are engaged in the field of sports in our family then we must give them the opportunity.
Thou shalt not drive them out of the plain, and put them in the room, and read.
And let him read, and let him prosper, but if he has more talent and zeal in sports, let him all be encouraged by school, college, family, neighbourhood.
Everyone has to dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my countrymen, it has been a time to create new experiences in the times of rainy season and continuous programmes.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and join you in the next Mann Ki Baat.
This year the heat of summer is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are waiting for rain.
When I am interacting with you today, Ramlan has started the holy month.
On this auspicious month of Ramlan, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic society.
There is considerable significance for prayer, spirituality and devotion in the month of Ramlan.
It is a matter of pride that 125 crore people of our country are in the country of India.
We must consider this magnificent heritage as our ancestors.
There are those who believe in God, who deny God in this country, who worship the idol, who oppose the worship of the idol.
Different thoughts, diversity of pilgrimage and traditions have come together with our feelings.
Be it religions or methods, theories or traditions, all these are the only messages given to us - peace, unity and harmony.
In this sacred month of Ramlan, we will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again congratulate all of you.
I am happy that many people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone individually wants to share with me with enthusiasm about their experiences.
"I speak to Dhiksha Kad.
While the habit of reading is almost freed from me, I have decided to read in holidays.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I knew how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out for India's independence and how many struggles were taken by the martyrs.
And that is why I urge you to send a message to your generations about this thing that Bhagat Singh ji's life has shown me the greatest achievement at the youngest age.
I am glad that the young society is keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about our body, material and spiritual sacrifices for this country.
Innumerable civilians have lost their youth in prison.
Many youngsters have kissed the silver rocks in their hearts.
Today, we can breathe the breath of an independent India because of their unbearable sorrow.
The people who spent all the time in the freedom struggle, they wrote the books, read, did all the big things and their writings have also played a big role in gaining independence to India.
Several years ago, I went to see the cellular prison in Andaman and Nicobar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book named Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on prison walls.
They kept him in a small room.
Do you know what the liberators have tolerated all the atrocities
When I read the book with Maji Janmad, Savarkar ji wrote, the question of seeing the cellular prison was raised inside me.
They are organising an Olympic scene, which is very inspiring.
This Andaman Nicobar, known as Kalapani, was from all the states who sacrificed their youth in prison, all the languages of India and met many sorrows.
My dear countrymen, on 5th June, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what does it mean to connect with nature
In terms of me, we have to join us and join us.
To connect with nature, to create a special land.
Who can express it better than Gandhiji.
Gandhiji once said that one must come out a world on not seeing, it is our obligation to worry about the world that we cannot see.
You must have realized that nature has the power to do.
Perhaps you must have been very tired, and you will take the water back to your face, then you will be able to imagine what kind of freshness you have reached.
The new energy emerges when we are connected to the five earths by which our body is created.
Therefore, on June 5, the world-class movement that connects with nature must be a movement to connect with us.
Vedas have shown the earth and the environment based on power.
The Adharvana Veda provides us the complete guidance of the environment in a way, which is a thousand years old book.
: - Mother Earth: Putro Ahm Prithvia: This is the case in our country.
It is said in the scriptures that the cleanliness that we have is due to the earth.
In our country, many festivals, many pilgrimage systems - indiscriminate, inhabitants, inhabitants of the city, inhabitants of the tribal society, the nature of nature is a natural lifestyle.
However, it is necessary to understand it in equivalent terms, connecting with modern ideas.
I have a lot of news from the states.
A big movement of tree plantation starts in almost all the states as soon as the rain comes.
Crores of trees are being planted.
We must also contribute more importance and contribution to the plantation of trees during this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st of June is a day to mark the world's best.
All the world celebrates this as World Yoga Day.
In the shortest phase of June 21, the world is spread all over the world as Yoga Day, which connects the people of the world.
On the one hand, while the separatist forces are showing their bad faces in the world, India's biggest trick of Yoga is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world with oneness.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, it can connect the world with yoga.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to emergence, due to rising responsibilities, life has become bigger due to pressure.
We have seen this situation in a young age too.
During the period of taking uncomfortable medicines, the pressure will be a cause for us to live a life that has gone away.
Yoga is close to guaranteeing both interest and sustainability.
Yoga is not just exercise.
How to take a healthy inclusive journey by mind and mind, if we want to experience such an inclusive journey then it is possible only through yoga.
Two days ago, letters have been written to all the governments and all the leaders of the world on the occasion of Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually, work is going on in this direction.
I have been advised to convey my best wishes to those who have given this basic advice.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the occasion of the 3rd International Yoga Day, three generations of the family have asked me to do yoga together.
Three generations like grandparents, mother-in-law, son-in-law and mother-in-law can do yoga and give them a picture of doing so.
Tomorrow, as a day, it will be a comfortable combination and a new dimension for Yoga.
Tomorrow, it will be a tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite you all.
As the International Yoga Day remains for three weeks, start the exercise from today.
Distribute, disseminate, connect people with Yoga for your share.
In a way, this is a healthcare movement that will prevail.
I invite you all to join this.
From that day onwards, I have visited different parts of India.
I am very happy to note that what Modi did.
An interesting telephone call came to me, and I didn't think of what was said in it.
But I thank you for making such a different attitude.
I believe that this phone call will happen to you as well.
Salute Modi ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I often see that Modi ji, wherever you are going, the people there are paying more attention to cleanliness on TV and social websites.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people are listening to your call and entering the society as a movement of cleanliness.
On the one hand, there has been awareness about cleanliness among children.
Many times I have seen that they are hiding on the streets of their elders.
After launching the Swachhta Mission in the valleys of Kashi, it has become a catastrophe.
You are right to say, wherever I am going, the government machinery is doing cleanliness, but now it is becoming a Swachhta pledge at the social level.
5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I go, a lot of cleaning work is going on.
The media also has a lot of importance and a few days ago I had visited the Kutch region of Gujarat.
There was a massive cleanliness movement.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, I guessed that this thing was right.
It is a matter of great pleasure that all the other productive issues are going on to welcome the Prime Minister, but it is a matter of great pleasure to give importance to cleanliness.
It is a joy to anyone who wants cleanliness and it is imaginable.
I extend my best wishes to all those who strengthen the cleanliness work.
One has given me a suggestion.
That's why it's a smile.
Anything is good but I have to think about it.
It is better that I will remove such tons of potatoes rather than bestowing goods.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to conduct a major important movement on waste management with the help of urban representatives.
On June 5, the world environment is going to be available to collect solid waste and liquid waste in about 4000 cities of the country.
There are two types of pipelines to be provided, one green and the other blue.
There are two types of waste materials - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulations, in 4000 cities, the dry waste should be placed on the blue thread, the liquid waste should be placed on the green thread.
In the sewerage wastes, the necessity of vegetables, the rest of the food, the eggs and the leaves of trees, all the wastes, should be put on the green cup.
And all these shall be cruel in the fields, and if we remember the greenness of the fields, then it shall be remembered what to put in the bricks of the green cup.
The second kind of pot is that it should be placed on the dry pots, cards, iron commodities, glass pieces, cloths, plastics, polythenes, broken pots, rubber commodities and metals, which will be recycled and recycled.
A few days ago, one thing came to the fore, the Versova beach, considered to be a polluted beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this work, Afroz Shah gave him the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) the largest award.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Earth Award.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days, there have been discussions and analysis of the three years of the current government in newspapers, TV channels and social media.
Three years ago, you have given me the responsibility of being the chief servant.
Integrated research has been conducted and a large number of polls have come.
I see all this as a very healthy symptom.
The last three years have been addressed in every speech.
People at all levels of society have also studied this.
This is an excellent activity in the democratic form.
My clear and sustainable view that the governments are responsible for retaliating in the democracy should be dedicated to the people and to the people of Macaesar.
I extend my gratitude to all those who have expressed their faults and supported them by advising them, and advising them deeply on our work. I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have made significant backgrounds.
Whatever crimes are being expressed, there is a possibility of doing so.
The work may be good, less benefits may be bad, however, it may be possible to learn from them.
Conductive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This analysis and research is very important for an awakened country and an academic country.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you, all that is bad as a common citizen, as an ordinary citizen, as an ordinary person suffers from any ordinary person.
Some people look at the voice of man, some criticise it in political perspective, but after a long experience, I am feeling that when I started this programme as a member of every family of India, the voice of man will change me.
I feel like sitting in the middle of a family and talking about the things of the house.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, all those who are in such high positions have given their golden time and have given importance to the voice of man.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given me a new dimension.
Some of our friends used to work on the book Mann Ki Baat and sometimes spoke to me.
I'm lending to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, the next time we meet, there will be rainy seasons, climate change and results of the examinations will start learning again and when the rain comes, it will be a new joyful environment, a new smell and a fragrance.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment and love nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Each time such powerful inputs are in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, a detailed review is being conducted by the government.
What kind of complaints are the experiences of the people
We can generally see that it is the nature of human beings to provide advice to the next.
It is natural for us to suggest that somebody should do this immediately when we travel in trains and buses and if somebody gets coughed then it is our natural nature.
Initially, when Mann Ki Baat was consulted, it was seen that it was a habit for many, but when we tried to reach it, I was actually swallowed in a very happy flood.
After I pointed out that in the Prime Minister's App, do you know what kind of innovative methods were being taken to prevent food from being waste from all over the country on MyGov website
I don't even think that the younger generations of our country have been doing this thing for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been done for years, but the youth of my country have been engaged in it - it was known after me.
Many have sent me video.
Bread banks are being conducted at several places.
People provide bread from their side, bring vegetables, whom they need, they come and get them.
Nobody who is happy and buys does not need to think of himself as low.
This is an example of how to work with cooperation in society.
Today is the last day of April.
The establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra comes in May.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Both states have been making efforts to achieve new developments and have contributed to the progress of the country.
In both the states, great men have emerged and their lives have been inspiring us in every section of the society.
Remembering these great men, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of 2022, when we are going to be 75 years of independence, we must take the pledge of enhancing our states, our society, our city and our family on the occasion of the birth anniversary of 2022.
We have to fulfil the commitment and move forward with the help of all citizens.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of these two states.
Ecosystem change has been a thing that was spoken only at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily life, we are feeling it and joking it.
Nature has changed the rules of its flame.
This time, in the months of May-June, we have experienced the heat of our country in the months of March-April.
When I was examining the advice of the people for Mann Ki Baat, there were more suggestions about what we should do during the summer.
It would be very beneficial to re-think all things at the right time, even if it was not new.
Prasad Kumar Mishra, D.
They have asked to keep water on the upper layers in the milk line.
I have seen small children in the family doing this special thing.
And if they repent, why should they fill the water, they shall see that they are ten times a day, and are in the vessel.
Not only this, the birds come and drink and look carefully.
It appears to us like a game, but in fact, the magnificent experience of blessings is pouring in the minds of that punch.
In our country, a musical life with birds and nature is natural, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts made at the social level.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was a 100-year-old Dharmaguru Saidna Saheb of the Dawudhi Bohra community.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate his 100 years, the people of Bohra community organized a massive movement to save the Gurus through the Purvani Trust.
It also got place in the book of Kinnas World Achievements.
If we are so distressed, we also forget to ask if the milkmen, the seller, the postman, come to the door of our house, if you drink a chance to drink this summer.
My young friends, I want to exchange some things with you.
Sometimes, I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and in a humble circle.
Mother-in-law is protecting them very safely.
There are others, however, but most of them are in a heroic circle.
Now the examinations have been completed and you have laid down the schemes to spend holidays.
After the heat is over, the summer holiday will be slightly sweet.
I am giving you three suggestions to use the holidays well, if you are the third of them then I am special, but I am trying to do something in them.
Let us take a new experience, try to achieve a new capabilities, let us go to a place where no one can hear, no one can see, no one can count, no one can know.
New places, new experiences and new capabilities will be available.
The test must be positive, come out of your speculative circle.
We are a middle class family and a happy family.
In the evening, take your football or your nest or take other sports goods and go to the habitation of the poor.
You will feel that you will be able to get the joy of playing with the poor children there so far.
Did you think that when you get the pleasure of playing this kind of poor children in the society with you, how many changes will take place in their lives
If you go once, your mind will want to go there again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several autonomous organizations are in service.
You should connect with the Guru of Kullu and connect you with some organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
Sometimes the summer camps will be organised, governance development camps will be organised, several constructive camps will be organised and connect you with them.
After taking part in such camps, when you have been elected, teach the poor to learn that you have learned as a service free, and that there is no chance to learn.
You can teach them how to do it.
Though technology is considered to be reducing distances and cutting the borders, the adverse consequences of these are scorching my mind.
Six people are sitting in one house, but cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everybody has lost due to technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is a power.
Another thing I told you is about the skills, don't your mind want to learn something new
Sometimes there is also a fear that our younger generation is turning into a robo.
Our young generation lives as an instrumental life. Friends, all the dreams that we dream in life are good things.
But we have to look at the human elements that are inside us, and keep in mind that we don't leave our humanity.
Can we not pay any attention to skill development
A little away from technology, we are trying to spend time with us.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn paintings, you can't come up to the best, but you can't swim in the paper
The feelings within you will start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these capabilities and these activities will be pleasant to you and the binding binding binding you on one side will be removed.
Make something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
If you think that after all the selections have been completed, you have not got the opportunity to imagine all this after coming to a new stage in your industry.
And that is why I would like to tell you that if there is a Magic Learning Country, you should learn the Magic Magic.
Enjoy your friends by doing this.
If something you don't know, try to learn it, it will surely benefit you.
Beware of the creative energy that is inside you, which will create an excellent platform for development.
Friends, we cannot even imagine how many things we have to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new circles.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there and then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
New generations have almost liberated cash transactions.
Whatever you do, you can earn through this scheme, do you know about the government of India
But someone else can recommend this.
You can connect others with it and if the new person does 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees for this.
10 rupees will be included on behalf of the government.
If you say that you will gather 20 people a day then you will be able to get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen and students can get income through this.
The project will remain till 14th October.
You should contribute towards creating a digital India.
You are the defenders of New India.
I received a very interesting phone call.
I salute Shiva Choubey, Prime Minister, from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis and I don't need to wait for anyone.
That's why I would like to thank you for your decision.
The government's decision to eradicate red light is an organisational action.
But this culture, which is in the mind, must be rooted in the roots.
If we all work together with awakening, we can take it away.
In terms of this, my aim is clear - Ever Very Burson Is Impartant, everyone is important.
If every person has a significance, if we accept the importance of the people of 125 crore people, we understand the importance of the people of 125 crore people, then there will be a great power to fulfil the big dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the great Ramanujars of 125 crore people of the country.
Because of some reason we were stuck in the holes, we were very small and we were more and more used to think about centuries.
The centenary of other countries in the world is also considered to be very important.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is difficult to break out social conditions.
How was it a thousand years ago
Some people knew that he had created a massive struggle against the bitterness of the society, the feeling of being a high-hearted and destitute, and against the status of caste.
Whom the society considered to be unprofitable, dragged him through his operation.
He launched a campaign to enter the temple thousands of years ago and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will also release a postal head to mark the commemoration of the sacred Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute the sacred Ramanujacharya and showcase my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance in the month of May.
In many parts of the world, it is celebrated as a day of labour.
While talking about labour day, there is talk of labour and labour, naturally I remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect that the workers have received.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of labour is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, while talking about the sacred Ramanujacharya, there is a chance to remember Jagatguru Basaveswar ji, the greatest sacred and social reformer of Karnataka, who lived in the 12th century.
He also had the opportunity to release a sum of his golden words.
In the 12th century, he released deep comments on labour and labour in Kannada.
In Kannada, he has called Kaya Kave Kailash, which means that only you can reach the palace of Lord Shiva through your hard work, that is, heaven is only by working.
While talking about the labourers, it is natural to see Dathopant Tangdi keeping them in mind.
My dear countrymen, we are going to celebrate Buddha Purnima after a few days.
People belonging to Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate this festival.
When the world sees the violence, war, destruction and the conflict of arms, Lord Buddha's views are very fit.
Buddha is an excellent example of breaking the war of Ashoka's life in India.
This great day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated as the Visaak Day of the UN.
This year, this event will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this sacred day, I am blessed to pay my homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
We believe that our neighbours should be musical and they should also move forward.
There are many potential.
India will launch the South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The skills and facilities of this satellite will help significantly in economic and developmental activities in South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our vision for South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are combined with preparations for their children's selection.
Today, on 26th March.
It is a matter of great pride for us to be the wealth we all celebrated by Rabindranath Tagore and his memories.
The assassination of Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 was carried out, at that time, Rabindranath Tagore became one of the suppressors who shouted against the massacre.
The assassination had a deep impact on the mind of a boy who was twelve-year-old.
Three days before this day, on March 23, the British had captured Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukdev and Rajguru.
On March 23, when this sad incident took place, there was no fear of death on the faces of sacrifices like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru, who had blessed the mother of India.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still sympathetic to all of us.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The whole of the British empire was driven by these three.
They were imprisoned, were punished for sleeping, but they were worried about how to conduct them.
Several years ago, when I had the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel some kind of shock on that land.
Whenever you get the opportunity, I urge the youth of the country to go to the place where the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Badakeshwar Dutt are located.
It was a period of a widespread freedom struggle and its intensity.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru were encouraging the youth to take up armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, Gandhiji had performed Champaran Satyagraha in April, 1917.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
It was for the first time in Champaran that the ideas of Gandhijis ideas and the ways of Gandhijis freedom struggle in India.
It is a turning point in the freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of the means of struggle.
Champaran Satyagraha, Keda Satyagraha, and Mill Labour strike in Ahmedabad, all have a deep impact on Gandhiji's ideas and methods.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, we cannot estimate the Champaran Satyagraha in the minds of Gandhiji.
Just imagine, one who returned to India in 1915, just two years...
He highlighted Gandhijis integration capabilities through Champaran Satyagraha, the power to understand the nervousness of the society of India, the power to inspire the people who were very poor and uneducated against the British and to welcome them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how to start a public life, how to work and how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, such as Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani, were all working to go to the village of Gandhiji.
He learned how to connect with the people and how to connect their work with the freedom struggle.
Today, we are travelling in the 21st century, who do not want to change India in today's era, don't any Indian want to participate in the change of the country
Their efforts to transform this venue of 125 crore people will be a strong foundation for building a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the chain of 125 crore people.
This is the feeling of building a New India with 125 crore people.
This is a desire, a desire, a feeling, a thirst, a thirst, a desire that is within the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
They are working in such a way as those who don't feel quietly.
Many people go to the hospital every day and help patients.
Asked about the need, there are many who go to Ododi and donate blood.
And whosoever dwells in a shovel, there are many that fulfil the best thing to feed them.
Our country is such a country with valuable fertilizers.
People's service is the Makeson Service. This is all in our nerves.
If we see this entirely, it is very well known that if we look integratedly, it is the greatest power.
When we talk about a New India, it is natural to raise criticisms about this idea and it can be accepted in a democratic manner.
But if 125 crore Indians are determined, if they decide their path, if they start stepping in one after another, then the dreams of 125 crore people of New India will begin to grow when we are looking at it.
There is no need for all things to take place in the budget or to be a government scheme or to be spent from the government money.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should perform his obligations as a citizen and recognise the responsibility.
Why shouldn't we do this journey to make our self-reliant self-reliant
I urge you to come to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in the Digital Movement through Digital Payments.
After the withdrawal of currency, there have been many progress in digital payments.
Since we have started the BHIM App for 2-3 months, so far about 1. 5 crore people have done this.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the war against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore Indians fulfil their commitment to transform digitally this year at a cost of Rs.
In order to implement this, we can deliver the school in a digital manner, we can pay the travel fees for traveling in a royal or aeroplane in a digital manner, we can buy medicines in a digital manner, we can make ways for digital payments if we are going to buy cheap foods.
In the past, several events were organized for Digital Celebrations for peoples awareness.
It was decided to do 100 events across the country.
80-85 events have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won their awards.
Everyone is sure to take this task forward.
A large group has also been organised.
I am confident that how much more time remains on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, we will be aware of the BHIM App.
We must contribute to reducing the use of cash.
Dear countrymen, every time you have been giving me several suggestions that I would like to ask you to give advice for the Mann Ki Baat event.
But I can see that you have always been pressurizing your suggestions about cleanliness.
This river is passing through Rispana bridge and it flows around my house.
We tried to make people aware that we went to the area against the waste of the river, walking and walking, but it did not benefit from it.
I urge you to send a team from your side, or through newspapers, to create awareness about this.
Brothers and sisters, See how much pain is in the mind of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good symptom.
Awareness has also emerged since the launch of Swachhta Mission.
Everybody has been constructively connected to it.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
The hatred against filth is increasing.
Awareness, positive contribution, movement, the importance of this is certainly important.
Even though the work is difficult, it must be done.
I am proud that this feeling, which is being created in the country's new generations, children, students and youth, shows a good sign.
Today, in the voice of my mind, whoever is listening to the thoughts of Gayatri, I want to say to all of them - the news given by the injured should be a message to all of us.
Ladies and gentlemen, from the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat programme, there have been many suggestions about losing me food.
We all know that when we are eating in our houses and public events, we are eating more than required in our layers.
Have we ever seen how much damage is caused by the remnants that we leave
If we don't relieve the remains, do you think it will help the poor to provide food
However, the liberality shown in this matter is a massive treachery against society.
This is an injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted, it will be saved and the family will be economically benefitted.
This is a good thing, even though it is a family oriented, it is a matter of benefit.
I want to be more aware about this.
I know some youngsters who are driven by a mobile app
And if the food is left anywhere, they will be informed, and they will collect the rest of the food, and shall share it to the needy.
Our youngsters are working towards this method of better utilization of food.
You can meet such people somewhere in every state of India.
Look at the ways to see change.
They always say that those who are aware of the health of the body, take a little less than the leaves and fill the stomach a little less.
World Health Day on 7th April.
Universal Health Coverage by the United Nations by 2030 has set a target of healthcare for all.
A study states that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from depression.
Friends, speak to parents, brothers and sisters, openly to the teachers and speak as far as you are inside.
Have you observed that why do they do so
You must understand that they are on the first step of stress.
Depression, psychological and psychological disorders.
As diabetes provides a comfortable basis for all kinds of diseases, the power to bear our stress, fighting against terrible conditions, its simplicity and the capability to fulfil our capability.
If you are unable to speak to those who are not able to speak openly then work with the feeling of service at some place near you.
You will be able to see that your sorrows melt down on your own.
If you try to understand the grief of others, if you do that thing with the spirit of service then you will inspire yourselves.
By interacting with others, by providing selfless service to others, you can easily descend the burden of your mind.
Similarly, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Start your efforts from now on.
Millions of people should ensure that they are socially involved in Yoga Day.
If there are some suggestions in your mind on the third International Day of Yoga, then you must send your suggestions through the mobile app and guide me.
You can create songs and compositions regarding yoga so that people's understanding can be increased.
Today, I want to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about health.
In the past, the government has made a big resolution.
It is a welcome thing that the number of women working in our country is increasing every day and their contribution is increasing.
My dear countrymen, on April 5th, the holy Rama Navami, the birth anniversary of Mahavir Jayanti on April 9th, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14th.
Let the lives of these great men inspire us forever, let us pledge to cook a New India.
After the spring, the crops will start getting older and the farmers will get the benefits of their hard work.
In many corners of our country, this innovation is celebrated on a variety of ways.
My best wishes to all of you for the New Year.
The winter is now hiding.
The spring time is registering his visit to all of us in life.
After the leafy season, new leather has started sprinkling on trees, flowers bloom, jungles, gardens and fountains are blooming.
Not only the flowers, but the mines also brighten in the throne of the supporter.
The springs of summer magnificent magnetics have started appearing in spring.
In the fields, the yellow flowers of mustard thousands of yellow flowers rely on the farmers.
The floral flowers of the flowers are envisaged to visit the Holi festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these dreams of climate change as very interesting.
The fields of mustard bloom, the trees bloom, the flowers bloom, the pigeons bloom, the pigeons bloom, when the natural tower blossoms, the atmosphere becomes comfortable, and the human being also enjoys the sweetness of this environment.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi Festival enjoy joyful flowers in the lives of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and human love, we are going to complete the Bhagni month and we are ready to welcome the new year.
The interaction between the two months of spring.
When I hear your suggestions before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I first thank the millions of people for sending me a lot of suggestions.
I am grateful to all of you, who have participated in the Prime Minister's App, in Twitter, in Passbook, through letters.
In the Narendra Modi App, Shoba Jalan ji said that many people do not know about the achievements of ISRO.
He is also asking you to inform about 104 satellites and interruption missiles.
I am grateful to you for recalling the exhibition that Shobaji had honoured India.
Our scientists have set India at the global stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
ISRO has achieved a new world record in the space sector a few days ago after he had successfully sent Mangalyaan as a plan to travel to the Mars.
Once India, 104 satellites of several countries have been successfully launched.
This is not only for ISRO but also for the whole of India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme has wondered all over the world and has lauded the success of Indian scientists all over the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - Cartosat-2D-This will be the source of Indias satellite, to identify mineral resources, infrastructure, development assessment and planning for urban development.
In particular, the number of fertilizers in the country, how to use them and how to take care of them, our new satellite, Cartosat-2D, will be a catastrophe for my farmer brothers and sisters.
As soon as we reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It has started doing its job.
It is a matter of great happiness that all these activities have been under the leadership of our young social scientists and our female scientists.
It is a matter of great pride for ISRO to contribute to the success of young scientists and female scientists.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all ISRO scientists on behalf of the countrymen.
You are making several new achievements every day to keep your aim of sustaining the space science in mind for the public and for the people.
Whatever appreciation our scientists and their entire team, it is less than that.
India has successfully tested a missile to block the missile from the defence sector.
This is a great achievement in the field of security.
You will be more happy to know that this technological capabilities in the world are only with the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though there is a missile that affects India from far-off places, our missile is capable of destroying it.
If we see a new technology, if we see a new scientific achievement then our people are happy.
In Brimmand, the mind of the human being is trying to understand the rules of the forces.
New science and new technologies are born from this.
Each technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
My dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed my voice that our younger generations should be attracted to science.
Many scientists need the country.
Scientists today become a cause of a sustainable change in the lives of generations of the era.
No scientific scientific scientific conditions have emerged from heaven.
And Gandhiji said that all the scientific achievements are discovered by experience.
Honourable Baba ji has said that our neo-scientists should be commended for their thirst, hard work and sacrifice.
Scientific needs to be accomplished by the needs of the people, how to make the principles more effective and how to manage the technologies, so that it can be an important part of the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Indian Foreign Department had organised a very unique competition on 14th NRI Day.
In Mumbai, in 2005, the widespread rain devastated, flooded, surrounding the ocean with wrath, and there were numerous hindrances.
Whatever is a natural hindrance, it is the first doors of the poor house.
They decided to find a solution to this, they saved the house for a long time and improved the house to save the household from floods and to prevent the diseases of water.
I could see many such innovations.
I have to say that many people are contributing this kind of role in the country.
Our society is also becoming a technological subordinate society.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digitalization has been given a lot of importance in the past.
Gradually, people are turning from the way of cash transactions and moving towards digital payments.
Digital inflation is increasing rapidly in India too.
In particular, young communities are making digital payments on their telephone.
I see this as a good symptom.
Our country has received a lot of welcome from the Lakhi Grahak Yojana, the fortnightly Consumer Scheme, the Digital Business Scheme and the scheme for Digital Business.
Nearly two months ago, 15,000 people have received a huge amount of Rs. 1,000 per day.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India is becoming a mass movement and the entire country has welcomed it.
It is a matter of great privilege that under the Digital scheme, 10 lakh people have received availability, more than 50,000 businessmen have received availability and more than Rs.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred businessmen have got one lakhs of rupees.
More than 4000 businessmen have received a huge amount of Rs. 50,000 per year.
The farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, householders and students are connecting them with greater zeal.
When I washed it, it was found that not only the youth but also the elderly, there were 15-year-old youth, and there were senior citizens of 65-70.
From Mysore, Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Prime Minister's App and he has said that he has received Rs. 1000 through the Rashtriya Krahak Yojana.
But I would like to share with you as important things in his writing.
Friends, Your name and your work are happy for all of us.
You are doing a very inspiring job.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his work after demonetisation and he has received a huge amount of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's visionary customer scheme.
Even today, he has become an angel of this project even though he is driving a car.
He will share information on digital payments with all travellers traveling in his car.
He is very enthusiastic to exchange things and encourage others.
The young friend of Maharashtra, Bhuja Nemade, is a student who is studying the backbone and shares his experiences about how his family uses RuPay cards and e-wallets and how much happiness they get in it.
Come to lead this movement.
You take this forward, it has an important role in the war against corruption and black money.
In my sight, all those who are connected to this work are new warriors against corruption.
In a way, you're the fighters of honesty.
On April 14, the summit will be hosted for the greatest awards.
There are still about 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
A few days ago, Baba Saheb had passed the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
To remember his memories, you must teach at least 125 people to give the BHIM App.
This time, on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the BHIM App will become a special importance.
I also want to tell you that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb's foundation.
You must ensure that you go home and connect everyone with it and reach the hands of 125 crore people.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last 2-3 months, there has been an increase in many cities and villages in many cities.
Ladies and gentlemen, Agriculture is a man of our economy.
The economic strength of villages strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a happy message with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters are working hard and filling the pitcher.
This year, due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been an unprecedented result.
All the indications are that our farmers brothers and sisters have broken the old achievements.
When we see the masses, it starts appearing every day as if we celebrate the Festival of Festival of Festivals and Festivals.
This year, more than 2,200 lakh tonnes have been received.
This is 8 percent more than the last achievement made by our farmers.
This is a miraculous achievement.
I would like to express my gratitude to the farmers of the country.
There is another reason to thank the farmers - they have produced traditional foodgrains and have produced different types of pulses because there is a lot of protein in pulses.
The sound of the poor has fallen in the ears of my country's farmers, they have produced several types of pulses in about two hundred and nine hundred hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service to the poor of my country.
I thank the farmers brothers and sisters of the country who have received the pulses in the masses by listening to one of my applications for a request from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody is traveling towards cleanliness in our country, through the government, through society, through organizations, through movements.
Somehow everybody is working as awakening about cleanliness.
The government is in constant efforts.
In the past, under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, senior officers of 23 State Governments were held in Telangana.
The seminar did not take place within the closed halls of the weekend in Telugu state and the importance of cleanliness at the grassroots was to be implemented.
On February 17-18, a training was launched in Hyderabad to humiliate toilets.
Authorities showed how the toilets in 6 houses could be humiliated and cleaned and removed the tablets of two tables of toilets and bring them back to use.
They showed how comfortable the toilets used for this new technique, there was no difficulty, no problem, no psychological obstacle, no hurdles.
Just as we clean the toilets, we can clean the toilets.
A 6-member household, an average double-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-two-three-two-three-two-three-three-two-three-three-two-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three-three
After that, the waste can be easily removed and reversed to the second bag.
Whatever things are shown in it, how much will be beneficial.
Even in the government, various sectors are often organizing meetings related to cleanliness for two weeks.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will join hands to strengthen the Swachh Bharat Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will jointly take the Swachhta Mission forward for the last two weeks of March.
The entire country feels a new energy, inspires self-confidence, if any citizen in our country works well.
We welcomed the courage of our talented sportspersons at Rio Paralimbics.
In the last lap of the D-20 World Cup for visually impaired people this month, India defeated Pakistan and became the world for the second time and honoured the nation.
I once again congratulate all the soldiers who have come here.
We are proud of the achievements of our handicapped friends in the country.
I have always remembered that our talented brothers and sisters, who are more talented, compassionate, accomplished and with mind.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is sportspersons or space scientists, women of our country are not succumbing to anybody.
They are moving equally and brightening the country's goodwill through their achievements.
Over the past few days, our female villains have won silver in the Asian Rabbie Services Cadre.
My best wishes to all these virgins.
World Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India, women should give importance to children, there should be an increase in awareness in family and society, and there should be an increase in understanding.
Today, this is not just a government scheme.
It is a social understanding, a movement of education for all.
In the last year, this scheme has connected the peoples society, has been contemplating this important thing in every corner of the country and has changed the mindset of the people about the old habits that have been going on for years.
It is a matter of great joy when the ear falls on the news that the girl is born.
In a way, the positive thinking of women children is due to social conception.
I have heard that due to a special movement in Tamil Nadu district, milk marriage has been stopped.
More than 175 milk marriages have been stopped so far.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand women children under the Shuganya Samruti scheme.
As per the collection model, connectivity model of Jammu and Kashmir, all sectors have been linked to the scheme to protect the girl child, to teach the girl child, and also to the village councils, efforts are being made by the district administration to supplement the child and ensure their education.
Under the scheme of laying the doors of every household in Madhya Pradesh, a movement is going on for the education of every village-to-house girl child.
In Rajasthan, the movement is going on to re-establish our children, our school, and the movement, and to re-establish the women who have left school education in half.
I am telling you that the movement of serving the girl child and serving the girl child is taking various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It is collaborating with innovative ideas.
This is being changed as per regional requirements.
I consider this as a good sign.
On 8th March, when we celebrate women's day, we must be unanimous, we have the opportunity to interact with all of you about something or the other, our Indian women, they have no more power, they have no dearth, they are all equal.
You have come together with this positively.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
The world walking, the condition of villages and the feelings of the poor in the minds of the poor come to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our ancestors have made the system of climate cycle, economic cycle and social life so that there is no recession in society in any situation.
In the last few days, we have celebrated many celebrations.
Even after thousands of years, every celebration is filling itself with a new inspiration, a new energy...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes he worked to remove the leaf of food, that is, we feel innovation in his every activity.
Therefore, when I interact with you today, my child goes milk to two Mohans.
One is Mohan, who hits the Sudarshan cycle and the other is Mohan.
And Mohan, which touched the Sudarshan cycle, went out to the shores of the river Yamun, and dwelt in the city of Dwarkai, and came to the shores of the sea, and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who was facing the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellect, his obligation, his capability and his ideals to avoid war, without conflict, even thousands of years ago, according to the circumstances of that period.
At the same time, Sarka-affected Mohano gave a new shape to the freedom struggle and to empower the nation to secure human values and to the fundamental elements of governance, and to make a new turn to the entire world, which is still unique.
What is the significance of unhealthy service, what is the significance of wisdom and what is the significance of moving ahead with laughter in the midst of all the deaths of life, we can learn from the life of Lord Sri Krishna.
Today, when we are talking about the festivals, India is engaged in a big event
Not only India but the whole world is talking about this.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Nanal Gandhiji.
On October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, on the coast of the sea, today, we have born a era, not a person in a small house called Kirti Mandir.
This gave a new turn to the entire human history and achieved a new achievement.
And brothers and sisters had always been associated with Gandhiji, in a way it became a sustainable part of his life, it was the duty of service, service and service.
If we had seen his entire life, he was engaged in the service of the people of the society that was suffering from diversity in South Africa, and during that time, it was not a small thing.
He served for the oppressed farmers in Champaran.
If someone needs help, he will be able to serve at any time.
He not only strengthened the service but also strengthened the spiritual joy associated with service.
But at the same time, the experience of self-sufficient joy and self-sufficiency is also enjoyed in the service.
We can clearly understand this through the lives of our brothers.
For Gandhiji, individuality, society, humanity and humanity are all.
Whether it is Africa's Financial Plant or dolsty, be it Sabarmati's blessings or Varta, he has always been firm on social integration.
I believe that I have received the blessings of paying my homage to many important places related to the neighborhood.
When the society comes, there is a power to do so, this event of Gandhi 150 must have all social expression and service.
Whatever the mind feels, it should be a good wish, a good aim, a harmony, a service with full dedication, a self-sufficient joy: a sustainable joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Tandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, who was named after salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to the nation in Tandi.
I urge you all to travel to some place related to Nanal Gandhiji.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions are planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I want to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, at the Venice Biennale, many interesting scenes of Gandhiji's memories have been shown in the Indian Museum.
The area of Haripura is individual interesting.
You will remember that during the Haripura Congress conference in Gujarat, the event that was elected as the leader of Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has been spent in these arts.
Before the Haripura conference of the Congress in 1937-38, Channel had called on the then Chief Minister of the Kala Bhavan of Shantiniketan, Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to exhibit the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and exhibition at the conference.
This is the handicraft of Nandla Bose that enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited villages adjoining Haripura and took paintings to showcase a lot of rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these invaluable creations.
Once again, with the best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope that every Indian will take some pledge.
For the country, for the society, something has to be done for something good.
This is the best, real activity that we can do for ourselves can be bowed down.
You all will remember that for the last few years, we have been conducting a Swachh Hi Seva Mission for two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
On this mission, there is enthusiasm in all sections of the society.
My businessmen, brothers and sisters, all have touched an announcement table in their shops and the customers have written in it that when they come out of the house, they should come with cloth.
It will also contribute to saving the money and the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of our brothers, on this occasion, we must dedicate to the nation that is freed from open defecation and the foundation stone of a new mass movement against negative materials should be laid across the country.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every small and urban person, and I bow down and pray to the people of the city and we must celebrate this year on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in a way to liberate our Mother India from emotional secrecy.
I also urge private corporations that you should come forward to get rid of these negligible things after accumulating.
They can be recycled.
They can generate fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I would like to touch something of greater importance than a Sanskrit word.
Even though this was written several centuries ago, do you still know how important it is
The curtains are called rocks.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
Whatever, we have scientificized the knowledge of food.
We need a balanced and nutritious diet, especially for women and children, because they are the future foundations of our society.
Under the Nutrition Mission, nutrition has become a mass movement in modern ways across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my attention.
There was a massive movement of cereals in Nashik.
Anganwadi brothers and sisters are collecting one handful of grains from the people in the days of harvesting.
These pulses are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This is the first time that the child is being provided with a strong diet.
Not a liquid diet, a strong diet.
This is an excellent effort that can be implemented all over the country.
In many states, people are organising a campaign called Didi Bhajan.
Be it the birth anniversary of the family, whether it is a satisfaction or a memorable day, the family members prepare a nutritious meal and go to Anganwadi and go to schools, where all the family members themselves exchange food to children.
They share their joy and it will not be reduced when such happiness is shared.
Enjoyment with service is also a wonderful confluence.
Friends, through such small things, we can eradicate a strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, because of lack of awareness, the poor and the self-reliant are suffering from malnutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition movement across the country.
You must add it to you, get information, incorporate new ideas.
If you bring one or two people out of malnutrition then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
I had a lot of hope that when I was thinking about the voice of Mann Ki Baat this time, a single question would be asked about this matter.
And whenever I went anywhere for the last few weeks, whenever I met the people, there was talk of Man vis Wild.
I cannot even imagine that I will get such a chance to take place in the minds of the youth worldwide.
I went to Bhutan last week.
Whenever I have a chance to go as the Prime Minister, whenever the situation has become due to international yoga, whenever you go to anyone in the world, they start asking me about a 5-6-minute yoga.
So far, I have no idea of Yoga as a world leader, this has remained my experience all over the world.
But now there is a new experience.
Whenever I have to meet anyone, whenever there is a chance, they talk about the matters related to wildlife, they are engaged in environmental discussions.
165 countries are with a programme to broadcast the Discovery in their language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people ask me something with a little bit of discomfort, when Modi ji speaks in Hindi, when Bear Grills doesn't know Hindi, how could he speak so fast
Did it be subsequently collected
Look, there's no secret in it.
The reality is that technology was fully used to interact with Bear Grills.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing with me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places related to natural and wildlife.
I have already said, I repeat it and you must go to the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is wide.
Your thoughts will grow.
I got the good fortune to release the census of wildlife in the last months.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
The LTTE number in India is 2967.
A few years ago, it was half of them.
The LTTE-related summit took place in Russia's St. Petersburg in 2010.
There was concern over the decreasing number of LTTE in the world and finally confirmed.
This commitment is to double the number of LTTEs worldwide by 2022.
But because this is a New India and we are moving at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of LTTEs in the year 2019.
India has not only increased the number of LTTEs, but also the number of protected areas and social security forces.
When I released the LTTE data, I remembered the lions in the jungles of Gujarat.
I took over as the Chief Minister and the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir was decreasing.
Their numbers were also decreasing.
We have taken one after another in the Gir forests.
In 2007, we decided to take charge of women guards.
We have made developments in the framework to enhance tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, we need to create a right environment to save our forests, plants and wildlife, especially to live them.
My dear countrymen, who can forget Vivekananda's historic speech on September 11, 1893.
This young saint of India, who raised the humanity from the world, has left a illumination of India in the world.
Whatever slave the world saw India, the world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
Come, let us try to show that Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the shape of India and that he had seen the power of India.
It is within us, everything is there, we will move forward with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August.
It will be a very interesting movement for all children, elders, youth and women.
But I am not going to say anything about their smooth things today.
I want to create awareness about physical activity in your mind and we will set a few goals together for a stable India and for our country.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of negligent things, beyond the house, outside the house and beyond all the places, we will be able to snatch it on social websites.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, bow to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Presidents Day with joy and joy at all corners of the country.
In a way, it is a cultural festival that we have the vision of the Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the powers and the democratic system, and awakens the democratic responsibilities of our generations.
However, there is no longer much widespread and deep debate about the duties and rights of the citizens in our country.
Tomorrow, on January 30, our bowing day is hidden.
On January 30, at 11:00 in the morning, we will convey two minutes of silence and pay tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country.
As a society, as a country, it is our compulsion to pay a quiet tribute at 11 am on 30th January.
It is only two minutes, but it has socialism, stress and our concern over the martyrs.
We have shown natural respect to our country's army and the security forces.
I convey my best wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured with various medals for the brave missionaries given on the occasion of the President.
These medals have several stairs like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I would especially urge the youth to do a job as you have been working on social networks.
Write two good words on the website and share with your friends about the soldiers who are honoured this time.
When we deeply understand the messages of the courage, courage and valour of those soldiers, we will be surprised, proud and inspired.
On January 26, we have experienced great enthusiasm and joy, while on the other hand, some of our soldiers engaged in the security of our country in Kashmir are serving brave deaths due to snowfall.
I offer my respected tributes to all the soldiers who have lost their lives.
My young friends, you all know that I have been constantly shouting the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
January, February, March and April, these four months have been a challenge for every family.
Though a child has a choice in the house, the entire family is crying on the burden of examinations.
I always feel that I have to come out of this situation and that's why I want to talk to my young friends in detail in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
I know that this question is in the minds of all of you, even though Christ has asked this question.
Exams must be a happy opportunity.
Most of them have a time of pressure.
You must decide whether you consider it as a pleasant time or if you feel the time to pressurize it.
Those who are considered to be stressful, they are sorry - Please for Pressure.
Therefore, I believe that the time of selection is a celebration and a festival.
Whenever it comes to festivals and celebrations, the specialty of ourselves exhibits.
The entire family should work as a team and enthusiastically contribute to achieving this event.
You'll change when you're watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, the same examination is held in these 3-4 months.
It is our responsibility to transform everybody into a three-four-month celebration, in accordance with his family.
If you say that you were happy, if you were with a smiling face, you would feel comfortable, and in such a situation, many years old things will also begin to smell easily in your memory.
A year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom will be bright in your mind.
The sensitivity is sufficient, and it starts dreaming of a burden.
I feel this and feel that if there is depression, if we forget things, if we are confident then we cannot even imagine how many things are very beneficial will suddenly come to the mind.
You have no information or you have not worked hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your knowledge and your knowledge will lose yourself, the pressure will ride on you.
That's why I would say that a happy man is the second for a good mark-sheet, a happy mind is the opening of more values.
Sometimes I have been told that we cannot reach the examinations in the right perspective.
It's not a speech for your life.
How you live your lives, how you live, how you live and how you think you are not the choice of living.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of imagining us.
He went to the air force and failed.
The values have become very important.
This has led to the increase in obesity and the pressure in the minds of the students has increased.
In such a situation, I would like to understand your views on the temporary course of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, the values will be tied behind you as the winds.
It is necessary to know where I have come to know what my knowledge stands till yesterday.
If I tell you about the sports world, I have taken this exhibition as it will immediately be in mind.
The sportspersons are playing their own competitively and most of their lives are successful.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar.
He has consistently broken several achievements for 20 years and has achieved new achievements by breaking the previous achievements made by him every time.
His journey of life is very amazing because he has been following the path of making himself a challenge by competing with others.
Friends, You have to write a selection in every field of life and when you have to study for 2 hours, can you read for 3 hours
You must have decided to wake up at how much in the morning, it may have been late, but can you get up at the time you have decided
Therefore, I urge you to compete with others and make yourself challenges.
It should be kept in mind how my work was earlier and how to move ahead and how to do better.
With this perspective, you can understand the change in yourself.
S.
Sunder ji, it's absolutely right to tell you.
You must have noticed that even today, those who ask me questions, if they see me as advisers, there are more women in it.
Because when the mothers are aware of the future of children in the houses, they are able to simplify many things when they see how they work positively.
As per your ability, you should act as a guidance and all the work you have, all the time.
Once you have adopted, most of your problems will come to an end.
Parents and teachers' expectations are the basis of their problems.
Acknowledgement of such a situation shows a way to solve the problems.
The expectations make the road even more difficult.
You'll enjoy loading.
The pressure that we have undergone in the country has been completely drowned and in a way we are going to see the patient and fearing the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that sometimes we also create such a fear among our children.
Have you ever emerged that there should be a happy environment in the days of examination.
You will see that the atmosphere changes completely.
I received a miraculous phone call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
And if you ask him why he does not want to mention his name, then he will be yourselves.
Saying, Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of my work done in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of insurance, the thirst to learn in life will be lost.
A telephone call came: "Pradhan Mantri, my name is Monica, and I want to ask you two questions about my examinations as I read in class 12.
It is a common belief that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of focus on education.
This is the basic idea that is wrong and that's the reason for the problem.
If you want to achieve complete development, then there is a life beyond the textbooks, which is very wide.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Even if it's five minutes, surely take a little rest.
You can feel that your work is uncomfortable.
I don't know whether everyone likes this or not, but this is my experience.
When I speak on the stages of elections, sometimes my voice will refuse to collaborate.
Once a local singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you're sleeping.
So far, he didn't even think that there would be a connection between my sleep and my speech and my voice, he gave me the basic treatment.
If we understand the importance of such basic things then we will get many benefits.
And do not do all this, neither shall your household be angry with me.
On the day your values come, if you don't see, I will be seen in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
It is very enormous to keep mind, intelligence and body active.
Yeah, young friends, if you are engaged in the arrangements for your selection then I am talking about something and perhaps I believe that you might be able to comfort what I have said today.
But I urge you not to pay attention to what I have said.
If possible, don't work or do it.
Remember your resolution, rely on you, go to the election and wish you all the best.
Before facing every challenge, change that challenge.
Then there will be no challenges.
Across this mantra and move forward.
My dear countrymen, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the coastal defence officers and soldiers for their contribution to the nation.
It is a matter of great pride that our coastal guards with 126 vessels and 62 aircraft are 4th of the worlds largest coastal guards.
The mantra of coastal defence is Vaya Raksham.
The coastal guards are awakened for nights and nights in terrible conditions to protect the coastal and coastal areas of the country by pursuing their vision.
Many people do not know that not only men but also women are successfully performing their duties in the right hand at the coast of our country.
Our women officers of coastal defence are driven by aeroplanes or supervisors and hovergraphs.
Today, while coastal police is the worlds largest thing, I extend my heartfelt greetings on their 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard, which is engaged in the security of the coastal areas of India.
In our country, the Panchami Saraswati is a big festival of worship.
This is an opportunity to praise education.
Not only this, it is a time to encourage the soldiers.
Mera Rang De Basanti Sola, make me a spring-like idea.
I extend my best wishes to the people of the country on the auspicious occasion of this holy spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Akashavani in Mann Ki Baat has always used new colours in new verbs according to his creative capacity.
Over the last two months, they have shouted the voice of Mann Ki Baat in the states as soon as they have completed my Mann Ki Baat.
This is a great welcome.
I have got a great opportunity to join you through Mann Ki Baat.
Happy greetings.
My dear countrymen, greet you all on the day of Christmas.
Today, service, sacrifice and blessings have to give importance to our lives.
Several wealthy people have come and have given integrated wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came and cast two cubs of money.
Today, on his birth anniversary, we will pay tributes to him.
Two days ago, I was fortunate to inaugurate several development works in Malaysia's mother-in-law, Varanasi.
I laid the foundation stone of Honourable Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre will be set up not only in Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, the birth anniversary of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, is also the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna.
This country will not forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have also honoured the country in the field of nuclear power.
Atal ji's special contribution to him as a party leader, as a parliamentarian, through the post of minister or prime minister has become an example man.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute God for giving him better health.
As an employee, I had a great deal to work with Atal ji.
His memories are green in front of me.
Today, on the occasion of Christmas, the benefits of two schemes are available for the countrymen.
In a way, these two can be the beginning of new projects.
We can see the keenness of knowing about how to do cashless business and how to buy goods without cash, whether it is a village or a city or a reader or a beverage or a cashless transaction.
Everybody wants to learn from each other.
Likewise, the Digitan Business Programme, which has been inspired by businessmen, will be awarded to 15000 persons as Christmas Awards on 25th December
This project is going to take place from today to 100 days.
Every day 15,000 persons will get a prize of one thousand rupees per day.
Digi's business plan is mainly for businessmen.
Business and ease of doing business can be an excellent opportunity to boost the transactions.
This scheme is designed only by concentrating all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods from Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefit.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3000 don't have this.
Even the marketing poor can buy goods using USSD, feature phones and smooth phones, sell them, pay the amount and all of them will be benefitted from this scheme.
Those living in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win the prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India and 20 crore cards of the poor families and people who have their accounts can be surprised.
These 30 crore people will soon be able to participate in the award scheme.
I am sure that the people of the country will take a country in this way and they will be able to get the necessary information from their neighbouring youth.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see that how to use technology in the country, how to pay the money in electronics and how to pay the amount online.
For the past few days, unemployed business has grown from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a major decision to take this forward.
The businessmen are well aware of how big this resolution is.
Those businessmen who are doing digital payments, they are paying the amount online instead of cash usage in their business, such businessmen have been provided income tax benefits.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
A group is being formed under the leadership of Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, and they are examining several projects.
At the same time, the governments have also started and implemented several projects in their own way.
I am told that the State Government of Assam has announced that wealth tax and business commodity fees will be given 10 per cent tax on digital payments.
If the branches of rural banks take 75 percent of their accountants and make at least two digital transactions from January to March, the government will pay a sum of Rs 50,000.
The Committee has announced that in March, 2017, 100 percent of the villages covering digital payments will be provided at a cost of Rs. 5 lakh as the best scheme for Digi Payments from the Government.
Several organisations are making successful efforts to carry forward digital payments for rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that this year's sales increased by 27 percent compared to GNFC's fertilizer sales.
At a cost of Rs. 100, Rs. 80 and Rs. 50 are available and are deprived of insurance and healthcare.
But now money is being paid in a cashless manner.
Our country is a majority of the youth.
Technology is the art of our hands.
A country like India must be at the forefront of all countries in this sector.
Our youth have made significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital movement.
Our youngsters should add new ideas and intellectual technologies and modern methods to this sector as strong as possible.
At the same time, the movement to get rid of black money and corruption should be linked to the entire energy.
My dear countrymen, I would like to ask you before the voice of Mann Ki Baat every month, tell your suggestions and show your views.
Accordingly, thousands of letters have come into consultation with MyGov and narendramodiap, of which 80-90 percent are related to corruption and black money eradication and currency withdrawal.
After seeing all this, I feel that it can be distributed in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties faced by the citizens due to the withdrawal of this currency.
They mentioned how the new ways of climbing and irregular activity are being set up in many places while this work done by others, such a great work, for the benefit of the country.
I am grateful to you people, my countrymen, you are writing to me all these letters.
This path that has been brought under control is commendable.
Though it is true that all of us, our citizens are suffering, we are all in the fight against corruption and we are happy to have our cooperation in this war.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, as the military forces are fighting,' Gurmani Kewal has recorded his views on MyGov.
The people of every corner of the country are shouting at every corner of the country.
They are the factors that make themselves real changes, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who have not only tolerated many hardships, but also to those who have retaliated in the wrong direction of the people.
Efforts were made on a massive scale to contribute to the war against corruption and black money
Not only this, many were rolling on the ground, using their creation and intellect, cutting the tablets of those who spread the grass, showing the truth.
If 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something that is impossible
If you have the blessings of the people of Magazine, will it not be for the blessings of Isan
I express my gratitude to the countrymen, I bow to them and people are participating with full enthusiasm in this greatness against corruption and black money.
I had hoped that this war against corruption and black money in Parliament will be discussed in detail for political parties and for the funds given to political parties.
If there were meetings, there would certainly be discussions on this.
It is totally wrong to say that all those who are rebellious that political parties have been exempted in all ways.
Those who are unable to openly support corruption and black money, spend their full attention and time in looking for government's grievances.
A question has been raised often why the rules are changing.
This government is working for the masses.
The government is working to keep listening to the comments from the public.
When they take new methods, we also have to adopt new ways to break their evil ideas.
In this war, which is being carried out as Vitakkundan and Kodakandan, there must be an end to corruption and terrible procedures and black money.
On the other hand, letters have come from many people about what kind of bad practices are being carried out and how new ways are being used.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen.
In order to share such information, the Government has made an e-mail agency specially.
Besides, you can also send MYGov website.
The government has tied up the right-wing war against all kinds of evils, such as evils that you point out.
When your cooperation is not over, it's easier to fight.
The third type of letter writers are also in large numbers.
"Modi ji, don't despair, don't despair, do all the drastic efforts you have to do, but if you decide to travel on the path, then there is no point in addressing the conclusion and returning."
My dear countrymen, even though the voice of Mann Ki Baat was sounded last time, I had said that even among these villages, our farmers have made hard efforts and have done hard work to break the records made in the seeds last year.
From the point of view of agriculture, it is a clear indication.
Be it a worker of this country, be it a farmer or a young man, the efforts of all of them are making the country a new glimpse.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has honoured its name in many sectors.
India has progressed in the world class ranks through different indices, as a result of the continuous efforts of our skilled nations.
India's standards have grown in the World Bank's report on non-free trade.
India has risen to 32 places in the World Economic Organisation's report on global competitiveness.
We have moved 16 places in the World Bank's Infrastructure Services Index for 2016, in the World Bank's Infrastructure Services Index.
Several other reports also point to the same assessment and India is growing rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time we have read the anger of the people on the gathering of Parliament.
There is anger over the functioning of Parliament all over the place.
The President and the Vice President clearly expressed their satisfaction.
But even in such a situation, the mind is happy when some good things happen.
The country's attention has not turned back on an excellent work done even during the implementation of the Parliament.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy to say that the government's efforts have been made in the mind of the goal of development of handicapped persons and a bill related to it has now been completed.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this. I express my gratitude to the millions of handicapped people of the country.
This government is committed to the welfare of the handicapped.
Individually, I also tried to increase its speed to take this goal forward.
My goal was to provide their rights and dignity to the handicapped.
Our talented brothers and sisters have won 4 medals in the Paralimpics and strengthened our efforts and trusts.
They have not only honoured the country through their successes but have also made people surprised in the sea through their capabilities.
Our talented brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, our invaluable assets and invaluable capabilities.
After the Act has been passed for the benefit of handicapped persons, employment has increased to handicapped persons.
The allocation limit in government works has been increased to 4.
The Act provides excellent arrangements for education, facilities and complaints of handicapped persons.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been set up for the disabled and you can understand how much the government has been able to understand with the handicapped brothers and sisters since the instruments have been provided to the disabled brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
A new law has been enacted, following the sentiments of the United Nations.
Earlier, the handicapped were divided into seven stages, but now through the law, it has been 21 ways and 14 new positions are being added to it.
They have got justice for the first time and have got the opportunity to connect some differently abled persons with it.
For instance, we are linked to Thalassemia, Parkinson's, those affected and those who have a skull shape from birth.
The Indian cricket team has won a 4-pooja for the test competition against Britain.
Some of these young soldiers are commendable.
Our country's youth, Karun Nayar, had 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Teste Captain Virat Kohli not only had a good interview, but also a good leadership.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
Aswin's name was declared by the International Cricket Committee ICC 2016 as the Cricketter of the Year and the Best Test Cricketter.
My best wishes to all of them.
In the Hockey sector, 15 years later, the most beautiful and excellent news has been received.
Junior Hockey's team won the World Cup.
This achievement is a clear symptom for India Hockey's future.
Last month, our women have also worked well.
If India's women won the Hockey team Asian Championship a few days ago, India's Women's Hockey Team won bronze medals in the Asian Cup for 18 years.
Like every year, during the Deepawali, I once again went to the border areas of China and celebrated Deepawali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas with the ITBP and the Indian Tibetan border soldiers and the soldiers.
I am going every time, but the experience of this Deepawali is incomparable.
People are not just sending information but also connecting with mind
One describes poems, the other describes films, the other produces cartoons and the other produces video.
That is, every house is like the homes of the soldiers.
When I saw the letters, I was told how much imagination is in the minds of the people, how many feelings are there
A soldier of the armed forces wrote to me - Prime Minister, the soldiers, all of us, every festival like Deepawali and Holi will be on the border.
We will spend every week in the ideas of the security of the country.
Yes, however, the idea of housing comes in the festival days.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time it has not happened.
There is no idea that we are not at home in the day of this festival.
We feel that we are celebrating Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, during this Deepawali, should the feelings of the soldiers and the feelings of the soldiers in the midst of the security forces of our country disappear within a few weeks
As a society, I urge you all to make this feeling ourselves natural and join our sentiments, whether it is a festival or a festival or a happy occasion, we must remember the soldiers of our country somehow.
When the country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, it is certain that the strength and strength of the forces will increase by 125 crore.
Some time ago, all the leaders from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
They belong to the Panchayat Sammelan of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages of Kashmir.
I had the opportunity to interact with them for a long time.
They had come to talk about the development of their villages, some had come with demands, but when the conversation began, it was natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order situation, the future of the children were there.
With great love and open mind, these leaders of the village have touched the heart.
During the interaction, when I was talking about the burnt schools in Kashmir, I realized the sorrow that our countrymen were suffering from this.
And they thought that schools were not burnt, and the future of children was burnt.
I urge you to pay attention to the future of these children after you return to your towns.
I am very happy that all these leaders from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise given to me very well.
They went to the villages and awakened those who were far away.
A few days ago, 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the Board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of students in the vertical examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
I convey my best wishes to those students for their inspiration and my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the village leaders.
Several dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked the people to consult the people for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the advice of all came to the fore.
Everyone asked me to talk in detail about the notes of 500,000 rupees.
In his address to the people of the country at 8:00 pm on 8th November, I spoke about the launch of a transformational disaster in the country.
If I have made this resolution before you, then I have generally said that this decision is not normal, it is a difficulty.
But the more important is the resolution, the more important is to implement it.
I am hopeful that in our average life, many innovations will have to face difficulties.
Even then, I had said that this decision is very big and it will take 50 days to recover from its impact and then it will be possible to take us to a natural level.
It is not easy to get rid of those diseases that we have been burdened for 70 years.
I can understand all the problems you face.
The entire world is taking care of yourself and every economist is taking care of it.
India has immense faith in 125 crore people of India and 125 crore people of India are committed to fulfilling their commitment.
More than one and a half lakh postal offices and more than one and a half lakh bank agents, all sections of the Central Government, state governments and regional local bodies, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bankers, and dedication and dedication have participated in this work throughout the country.
In the midst of various kinds of pressures, all of them were fully associated with it, considering the work of this country as a root and an attempt to make a massive change.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this work.
I am witnessing that even in such a situation, everyone is working in banks and post offices.
When the matter of human love comes, they work only after traveling a little more.
One told me that there was a danger to an old man at the place named Khandwa.
There was a sudden need for money.
I am glad to know that when the banking worker was taken into account, he went to the house of an old man in front of him and saved money and saw no hurdle in the treatment.
Several such incidents take place every day in TV, media, newspapers and conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the companions who are working in this great velocity, who are the beneficiaries of contribution.
But however, if the island is spreading, even today, some of them have a habit of evil practices.
They still think that this corruption money, this black money, the unexpected money, and the financing money, can find some way to live.
They have been trying to save their money from the poor by embarrassing, talking or embarrassing their minds, putting money in their accounts, buying some jobs from them.
I would like to say to such people today that what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done to those people who do not believe in the law.
But please do not play with the lives of the poor.
And when the name of the poor comes in the registrations, then when the investigation is done, my dear poor people do not do anything in the problem because of your sin.
A very strict law has been passed regarding Binami property, which is going to be implemented, and there will be many difficulties.
The government wants that there should be no difficulty in our countrymen.
I live in Drali village of Drali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have taught a good lesson to those who have black money and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees.
If this action has not been taken then every citizen of India will never have a good time.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for this.
Some things are being obtained by the media by the people and by the government.
And when the common man of my country knows what is a wonderful capability, there is unlimited joy and pride.
Even if you want to eat, do not worry about the money, don't go back from here with hungry, don't leave the food and whenever you want to travel on this path, you must pay the money.
When people go there, eat food, after 2-4-6 days, they return the money.
This is the strength of my country, the spirit of service and sacrifice is bright.
During the election, I was talking about tea and this idea spread all over the world.
Many people from all over the world have started talking about tea.
But I didn't know that even marriages would take place during this conversation.
On November 17, a marriage took place in Surat with a tea interaction.
In Gujarat's sound, a woman gave only tea to those who came to her house for marriage, didn't join any other celebrations, didn't make any festivities, because there was a demonetisation due to the merchandise.
They also considered this as a honour.
It is a great contempt that the Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat are well-known in a big war against black money and against corruption through their marriage.
While giving a lot of blessings to Navarinith Bharat and Daksha, I convey my warm greetings to you for making marriage as a great root and making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties arise, people make a better solution to it.
Some people have received immediate benefits through this movement.
The country will have the benefits in the days to come, but some have the benefits immediately.
When I asked about the incident, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, because of this resolution on 8th, all came to Ododi to pay their old notes.
Out of 47 urban units, about Rs. 3000-3500 crore has been taxed during the period last year.
Where is Rs. 3,000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Now these municipalities have four times the money, whether the waste water systems are being set up for the poor, whether the water supply systems are being set up or the Anganwadi centres will not be natural.
There are many such examples that have had direct benefits to the eyes.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are the strongest pillars of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, this new change in the economy has led to the deterioration of every citizen in the middle of the villages.
But I would like to salute my countrymen specially today.
Now I was asking about the statistics related to the seeds of this season.
Be it wheat or pulses, be it oil crops, I have an account till November 20, the seeds have increased in comparison to the same period last year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important resolutions which have given importance to the farmers and the villages.
Under the Mudra Yojana, loans were made to them.
Several crores of rupees were given to the common man under the Mudra Yojana, because crores of people are engaged in such small businesses and they provide the speed of business to millions of rupees.
Today, whenever I want to tell my young business brothers and sisters, you can enter the digital world by using it as an opportunity.
You should also pay the bank's app through your mobile phone.
Your contribution to the creation of a society without cash wealth can be very big, you can use your business through mobile phones and we can do business in many ways without handling the notes today.
There are technological paths, which are safe and quick.
I just want you to give your support to this movement and I am confident that you will be able to lead the change and you will be able to provide such a leadership.
I am confident that you can do the business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I want to say to the labourer's brothers and sisters that you have suffered greater injustice.
One of the wages fixed in the paper is that the amount given in your hands is different.
You should get your wages full, nobody has to participate.
You should not be oppressed.
If you get the money in your bank accounts, you can also buy the goods in the nearby markets through a small mobile phone and you can pay the money thereby, there is no need for any smart phone and now your mobile phone is also working as an e-wallet.
Therefore, my labourer brothers and sisters, I urge you to make your contribution in this scheme so that I have made such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the deprived, for the benefits of the victims.
Today, I would like to interact with the youth in particular.
We are putting stakeholders around the world that 65 percent of India's population is 35 years old.
I am also aware that you have been contributing a lot to take it forward in positive ways.
Friends, You are my real soldiers, you are my real friends.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India, which is a golden opportunity to take the country towards economic heights.
My young social friends, can you help me
You know what the App means, you know what is online banking, that is, what is banking through a cloth, and the registration of travel through a clothing.
These things are very simple to you and you are also using them.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of a cashless society.
It is not possible that a hundred percent of the cashless society is not possible.
But why shouldn't we start making India a less cash usage society
Once you start using this less cash, the goal of the society is not far away from cash transformation.
I am confident that you will never give me disappointment because we all have the desire to change the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities have been made to introduce digital banking services or introduce mobile banking services to the society without cash exchange.
Each bank provides online facility.
Wallet's direct meaning e-purse.
Several cards are available.
According to the Jan Dhan Yojana, India's millions of poor families have RuPay cards, the very lowly used RuPay cards have started to be used after 8th, the burden has grown by 300.
Like the prepaid card coming on the mobile phone, the banks also have a prepaid card to spend money.
The UPI is an extraordinary base for business, so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is so simple as you send information on Wattsapp.
He is aware of how to send information to the Watts App today, how to forward.
Not only this, technology is very easier for this work that the biggest smart phone is unnecessarily required.
Money can also be exchanged through a mobile phone with common facilities.
Nobody can use it uncomfortably, whether a slave worker, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller or a seller.
I have stressed the efforts to make this way more easier.
All the banks are engaged in this.
Now we have canceled the additional fees for online business and we have brought all such taxes related to the card to strengthen the idea of non-trading society, which you might have seen in the last two-four days.
My young friends, even after all this, this is inevitable for all generations.
I am grateful that all of you are actively associated with this great work.
I am paying attention to the messages of the creation of the WhitesApp, the poems, the poems, the cartoons, the new imagination and laughter.
In the midst of the challenges, when I see the creativity of our younger communities, I see a basic infrastructural infrastructural within you when we meet the time to make such a big change today, just as the specialty of the land of India that once even emerged in wars.
But, my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, I once again say, I am confident that you and millions of youth of this country will do this work.
Today's first pledge is that you are a part of the society that is not a cash exchange.
Provide all the technologies for online costs on your mobile phone.
You must lead the unchanged society, the casualties emerging from the nets, the movement of liberating the country from corruption, the movement of liberating black money and the movement of freeing the people from the problems of the people.
Once you have learnt about how the benefits of the RuPay card are available to the people, the poor will bless you.
Within a month, we can stand as a new India and you can do this work through your mobile phone
Go to 10 houses everyday and contact 10 houses every day.
I urge you to come, not only your support but also to make this transformation a landlord, and to bring about change.
We will move forward in this war to free the country from black money and corruption.
This country has created a major revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I call upon all of you to join this work in every school, college, university, National Students' Force and National Welfare Scheme on a social and personal basis.
We will take this task forward.
We have all got the opportunity to serve the best for the country, and do not let this good opportunity go.
My dear brothers and sisters, Today is the birth anniversary of a great poet of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, and today is the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji.
You might have noticed that this centuries old artist Amitab ji has taken the Swachh Bharat to a greater height.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I pay tributes to Harivansh Rai for his respect.
I express my gratitude to Amitab ji for connecting with the voice of Mann Ki Baat and leading the cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, myGov and narendramodip continue to connect me with you.
Now at 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baat (Mann Ki Baat) is a sound, but in the languages of the state, it will start soon after it is completed.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is being celebrated with zeal and fervor all over India.
Our country is going to celebrate any festival in any corner of the country for 365 days.
But all this is one thing that we can clearly see, the entire journey of the festivals of India, its prosperity, its deepness and the convenience of the people are all connected to a basic mantra - the movement of individualism towards society.
Festivals are responsible for all trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now we celebrate holidays on Sunday, but you must have taken care of the holidays of the previous generations, be it the working class or the fishermen, on their full moon day and on the occasion of Amavas.
Science has proved to be the kind of transformation in sea water and the kind of impact on nature.
It has an impact on human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating holidays in our country is also living in harmony with disasters and science.
Today, we celebrate the Deepavali, as I have said before, it is a teaching and advising each of our festivals.
This Deepawali festival gives us the message that Dhamso Ma should go from darkness to light.
This is not merely the darkness caused by lack of light
The darkness of blindness, the darkness of incapacity, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evil.
If we can liberate from the darkness of the individual, the darkness of the individual and the darkness of the bitterness of the society, the aim of illuminating the Deepavali is to brighten the lamp.
You will see that every corner of India, every corner of the country, whether it is a large wealthy house or a resident of the poor, during the Deepavali festival, the Swachhta Mission is shining in every household.
Every corner of the house is clean.
He will also purify his soil mixture that the poor will have mud but the Deepawali has come.
Canada's Prime Minister is sharing his film on Deepavali through a Twitter.
On the occasion of Deepawali in London, the Prime Minister of the UK organized a welcome programme to connect all communities and also participated in it.
It may also be said that there is no UK city without celebrating Deepawali with great celebrations.
The Prime Minister of Singapore shared a film in Instagram with great pride.
Well, what do you know about the film
The film is a film by 16 women members of Singapore Parliament wearing a shovel of India and standing at the door of the Parliament.
All these are on the occasion of Deepavali.
I want to say that the day of Deepawali is the day of brightening, it is a great day to inspire all the people of the world from darkness to light.
During the days of Deepawali, reports of dangers, fireworks and future deaths are complicated.
And there is another distress - when a large number of doctors go to celebrate Deepawali with their families on the occasion of Deepawali, there is a confusion.
In particular, I call upon the parents and the insurgents to keep an eye on the fact that when the children are slaughtering the bats, the elders should be with them and they should be careful that they don't misunderstand anything.
Deepavali is celebrated for a long time in our country.
It's not a day
The govardham puja, Bhai Dhuj and Lab Panchami, which is long till the illuminating festival of Karthik Purnima, is a long period.
Along with this, we are happy to celebrate the Deepavali festival and also to prepare for Sat Puja in Mussoorie.
The Sath-Puja festival in the eastern part of India is a big festival.
In a way, this festival is celebrated as a big festival for 4 days, but there is a significance for this, which gives a big news to the society.
The Lord of the sun gives us all, and we are all from him: it is hard to see that the Lord of the sun is straight and hidden.
This sacrifice, penance and labour of the soldiers and the security forces is emotionally in my mind.
I want to share one thing from the world of these sentiments - we will dedicate this Deepawali to the security forces.
I called upon the people of the country to participate in the movement of Sandesh2Soldiers i. e.
I would like to bow down my head that there is no immense affection on the soldiers of the country, no pride on the forces and no pride of the security forces.
The media has also transformed this island festival into a day of thanks to the soldiers.
When we are in the mood, if we think about them then there is a new energy in those memories.
There is also a message that has multiplied power and the country has shown it.
Some were paintings, dumped and made cartoons.
I can imagine how proud this is for the soldiers of my country.
All these things have been identified in Hashtag, namely Sandesh2-soldiers.
I want to read the poem sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Sauhan ji.
Ashwini ji writes, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am happy to celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am laughing, all these are because of you.
I also congratulate the people of the country for their livelihood.
"My countrymen, there are soldiers in the birthplace and the soldiers are filled in the houses that have been supplied by a sister Shivani has sent me a telephone.
Let us ask you what the soldiers want to say to the family.
Salute Prime Minister, I speak to Shivani Mohan.
Military officers and soldiers, along with their families and their wives, perform a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, the entire military society has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the military brave is seen not only on the border but on every stage of life.
You might have heard that the habit of liberating the Himalayas from open defecation.
He belongs to Patana, a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
Our soldiers from this Indian Tibetan Border Force visited their village on holidays.
When he went to the village at the time of the Panchayati, there were discussions about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was found that some families were unable to build toilets because of the demonetization.
He immediately took the book of his cosmetics and gave Rs. 57,000 to the Chairperson of Panchayana, if there are no toilets in any 57 households, give a thousand rupees to each family from me, build 57 toilets and keep the village out of the open defecation habit.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has shown that he has given Rs. 1000 to 57 families and has given a new energy to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from open defecation.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that happened in Kerala too.
At the same time, the National Students Force's casualties, the country's well-being programmes and engineering students came to an end to build toilets.
All the commodities such as brass and cement, which were required to build toilets, were carried on their shoulders throughout the day and went to the forest.
They built toilets in the village through their hard work and these youngsters were freed from the habit of open defecation to the small village in the remote forest.
This is why Kerala is going to become an open defecation free state.
The state of Gujarat has declared that in all the municipalities and towns, more than 150 have been freed from open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally, these things are not taken care of.
The old schemes are underway, the new schemes are being implemented, the next schemes are expected and this is going on.
Those households in our country where there is gas connection, those households where there is electricity, they do not need kerosene.
But those who are worried about the government, kerosene is being provided, gas is being provided and electricity is being provided and the middle class is getting the opportunity to pay.
Look at such a big change, the sale of potato markets will be stopped, the environment will benefit, our foreign exchange will be saved and people will also be able to enhance the facilities.
Yes, there is no doubt that there will be trouble for the middle class and the uncashed.
My desperate countrymen, Gandhiji has always been a guide to us.
He sets the standards in every matter where the country should go and how to travel.
We must focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps after each other to liberate them from the seats.
Anyway, our ancient thoughts must be liberated from the variety of men and women.
Now there are toilets in school children, children and toilets.
It is a good moment for our women children to achieve the status of India without any difference.
The government has been vaccinating, but also millions of children have to get rid of the vaccination and target the diseases.
The Mission Indradhanush vaccine is being organized for children who are freed from vaccination, which gives children the power to get rid of serious diseases.
We have been in the 21st century but the situation of darkness in the village is no longer continuing and a big movement to carry electricity in the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of independence, how will she be healthy when the poor mother cooks food in the crushing smoke and 400 cigarettes smoke in her body
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and we are on the path of success.
Small businessmen, small entrepreneurs, vegetarians, milk sellers and finished shopkeepers are borrowed from the neighbours.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are successful movements which are being launched to get rid of the borrowers.
Direct money to the banks through Aadhaar, directly to the owners and the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the graduates in the lives of the common man.
We have to fulfil our breasts with the memories of human beings.
But a telephone call from Punjab, pain and pain touched my mind: "Prime Minister, bow down, sir, I speak from Punjab to Jasdeep.
Sir, on October 31, Sardar Patel ji's birth anniversary.
Sardar Patel ji had tried to unite the country throughout his life and he has succeeded in this goal and has united everyone.
I don't know what the country is fortunate and what else is being said, the same day Smt. Indira Gandhi was assassinated.
We are well aware of what happened in the country after that.
I want to understand your views on how we prevent such unfortunate events.
My countrymen above my creatures, this pain is not only of a human being.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the work of integrating the country.
Sardar Patel ji tried to conclude for loneliness and integrity because of his primarily objective, he became a ruler of anger, but he was not simple from the goal of unity.
But on the birth anniversary of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt Indira Gandhi.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of that man, who spent his whole life for integrity, the iniquity that was slain on Sardars, is on one side of history, sorrow to us.
But even in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the logical mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
Many languages, many castes, many garments, many food habits, but unity in diversity is the strength of India, the speciality of India.
Every generation has a obligation and every government is responsible for finding a chance for unity in every corner of our country and for the principle of unity.
We are also away from separatistic thoughts and divisive natures and save the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a better India.
The basic mantra of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar jis life journey started in the peasant struggle.
He's the son of a farmer.
Today we are asking the name of Amul.
Every object of Amul is well known in India and abroad.
But many people have the possibility that Sardar ji's vision of creating a milk manufacturer cooperative union.
He was called Kera in the district of Kheda in 1942 and in the form of that, today, we are the example of how Sardar ji worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I salute Sardar ji with my respect.
On 31st October, on the day of integrity, wherever we are, let us remember Sardar ji and fulfil our commitment to unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepawali is celebrated as a light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev jis faiths are for the entire human society, which is not only spoken to India but also for the entire human society, which is still guiding.
This is the message of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Peace, unity and harmony are the key mantras.
The goal of liberating society from diversity, hypocrisy and illiteracy was that of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
May your dreams, your commitments be successful in all ways.
In the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country, after the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri region.
I pay my tributes to all the brave and brave soldiers.
This passionate event has swollen the entire country.
The nerves of the people of the country enhance sorrow and anger
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
This loss is being experienced all over the country.
That's why, people of the country, I still tell you that the culprits will be punished and they will not be able to escape from the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will break every surrounding with their might, and the 125 crore people of the country will show their supreme bravery in the way of living peacefully.
We are proud of our army.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir specially.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemies of the country.
When they have started understanding the truth, they have begun to drive away such harmful forces from them and travel to the peaceful path.
Every mother and father wishes that schools and colleges start functioning at the earliest.
For the past few days, business has started doing well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be a solution to our problems, our progress can be a path of development.
For our future generations, we must take new heights of development.
I am sure that if we communicate peacefully and guide the solution to every problem, we can make the future generations of Kashmir a better way.
The responsibility of the security administration of the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to take some measures to build the law order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to follow the capabilities, powers, laws and regulations we have to use in law and ensure the peaceful lives of the common man of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who differ from our ideas and imagine new ideas.
Shershvardhan, a young man who reads class 11, has put a different view on me.
'After the extremist attack, there was more concern in my mind, there was a debate in my mind to do something, but I didn't know how to do it.
This is a matter of great pleasure for me that in such a small age, you are positively reflected.
But Harsh Vardhan is a great value for the anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have advanced a positive approach.
But you know that during the 1965 war Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had led the country, this kind of feeling was enhanced all over the country and there was a passion and a patriotic dream.
There was a commitment to do something in every citizen's mind.
At that time, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to make this feeling of the country excellently.
He gave the words of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and encouraged the people of the country to work for the work of the nation.
One more effort to express patriotism in the midst of the ambition of bombings is to be understood by every citizen, which Lal Bahadur Shastri presented.
While Gandhiji was guiding the freedom struggle, he successfully worked to give a boost to creative work in the society when the freedom movement was very fast dreaming.
We and our army will fulfil our duties, the people of our country and every citizen will contribute a constructive part of our patriotic spirit when the country will surely attain new heights.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who have come to participate in the Para Olympic Games is the success of human inspiration.
Varun Vishwanathan ji has registered on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have worked very closely and he has been asking you to tell it in the voice of your mind.
Not only to you, but to every citizen of the country, there has been an incomplete link between the sportspersons participating in the Para Olympics.
These Para Olympic competitions and achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the attitude of humanitarian views and the views of our disability.
I will never forget the words of our successor sister Deepa Malik ji after winning the medal on my lifetime.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including 3 women in our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, when the handicapped players play, they have more than their physical skills and their capabilities in sports, they are determined and determined.
Mariappan Goldenwell ji won the gold medal in the high altitude.
Mariappan lost his right leg in just five years.
Even poverty cannot prevent his mindset.
He is not a resident of a big city, but a middle class family or a wealthy family.
At the age of 21, he has given medals, not measuring physical disorders, but helping meditation.
While they have raised our feelings, they have also changed our views of handicapped people.
Can anybody imagine that the replies of the Olympic Olympics can be discontinued
This time it happened.
In comparison to the Gold Medal in the Olympic Olympics for 1500 metres, Abdel Latin Puducherry from Algeria in the Persons with Disabilities.
Once again, I congratulate these sportspersons, and in the future, India will travel in the direction of making an honest programme for its development and development of the Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in Gujarat's Navsari.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for Persons with Disabilities, in which many world achievements were made.
There I had to meet a little girl who hadn't seen her, Kauri Shardul was her name - she had a little child from the longest forest area of Nang district, and she loved her all the way to Ramayana.
And she told me some part thereof: and when I told him to accept it before the church, the people were astonished.
The Government of India has achieved a world record in Navasari and I consider it a great one.
600 disabled persons with disabilities were performed within nearly an hour through instruments.
This was placed in Kinnas World Achievement Book.
It is a matter of great pride for our nation to achieve 3 world achievements by the handicapped people on one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I would like to remember that cleanliness should become our nature, every citizen should be obliged to be seen as a waste.
I am sure that when two years will be completed on 2nd October, there has been awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take one step according to the saying that we will take one step towards cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
If the direction to go is right then it is sure that the benefits will be better.
Be it civilians, government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, schools or colleges, hospitals, children to elders, the poor, the farmers and women of the village have all played their role in cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a constructive job.
This is not a progress, we have to see further progress.
This is very important
This is why we talk about rural India so far about 2 crore 48 lakh i. e.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will be ended soon.
When I had recently visited the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the officers had told me that the day to come to an end of the open defecation habit.
Come on, people, we will see a hundred garlic progress.
In particular, my younger brothers are using technology completely today and I want to launch a programme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone phone call of 1969 to know how the Swachh Bharat Mission is located in your city.
You can use it completely, especially the younger generations.
The Government of India also urges the Corporate World to take forward your contribution.
Young entrepreneurs, who want to work for cleanliness, support the business.
We can use them as a Swachh Bharat Fellows and a Swachh Bharat Fellow of all the districts.
If this Swachh Bharat Mission stands with the governments then it cannot be achieved, it is natural that it will not be completed.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the Swachhta Mission, we have to move towards the direction of salt from waste.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy the combost fertilizer from the waste.
The farmers who want to join organic farming should see their way to get this fertilizer.
Those who want to improve the prosperity of their land, those who are interested in the health of the land, those who have a significant impact on chemical fertilizers, they should be given this fertilizer even though they need this fertilizer.
Amitab Bachan ji is contributing to this work as a business ambassador.
All the ministers, Chief Ministers, Municipal Mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to have a deeper discussion on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the financing model
There are discussions on all matters.
I am constantly watching that there are innovative news about cleanliness.
On that day, I had read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University were working to create awareness about the construction of toilets in 107 villages.
The Government of India has also prepared a list for one year in its Ministries.
Each sector should drive on cleanliness for 15 days.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj and Rural Development will collaborate and implement the Swachh Bharat Mission in their respective territories from 1st to 15th October.
In the last two weeks of October, from 16th October to 31st October, three Ministries such as Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs will carry out Swachhta Mission across their respective territories.
I urge the citizens to join if your work is related to these sectors.
You might have noticed that now a Swachh Bharat Mission is going on.
It was first reviewed in 73 cities, how cleanliness was done before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, now we are left behind in every city and there is a hope that the next time there will be a progress.
There is a competition for cleanliness.
We must contribute as much as possible to the movement of citizens.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It has been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I have been asking you to buy some doors.
I once again ask every family to buy some doors and burn the light in the houses of the poor on the day of Diwali.
On October 2, on Sunday, as a citizen, can we be able to do any work related to cleanliness
I urge you to join your cleanliness work for 2 hours and 4 hours and share a picture with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With the efforts of all of us, once again this movement will be strengthened and new pace will emerge.
Remembering Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we will fulfill the promise of doing something for the country.
In the past, the responsibilities of the countrymen, according to my request to expel gas subsidy, are one of the most inspiring in the livelihood of the country.
This is a movement to gather food and clothing to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers landed on the streets and took the old sports materials in the households and brought them to Anganwadi in the area of the poor.
Thanks to the political ideas that millions of workers like me have been driven by the political thoughts, the Prime Minister explained to them the political ideas.
Today, the centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji's centenary begins with the idea of recognising India's root-related political philosophy and humanity.
Sarvajan Hittai, Sarvajan Sukai, Sabka Saath, Sabka Sabka Vikas, Sabka Sabka Sabka Vikas.
Gandhiji also spoke of the interests of the people living in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal has laid the entire economic programme in one word that you are in every hand, in every land.
The country should celebrate the centenary of his birth as the welfare of the poor.
The focus of the society and the government should be on how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I recall Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who was a sensitivity of all of us, who was an incredible fervour of our thoughts, with great pride.
How is the common man of this country inspiring me
What are the desires and aspirations of the common man of this country
The registration of the common man in my mind and mind has emerged in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to you all for expressing my thoughts and making full efforts to bring it to all languages.
They gave letters after Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions, laying down the doors of the government, highlighting the government's deficiencies, making special programs with such letters, taking representatives from the government and setting up a base to solve the problems.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat did not stop with a 15-20-minute conversation, which was a new opportunity for social transformation.
What can be more happy than this
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to its success and bow to them.
My dear countrymen, next week, Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadasamy will start organizing Deepavali and a different situation will take place across the country.
This is the strength of the country, the unity of the society is the strength of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri, or Durga Puja, we will think of making this Shakti puja a way to social unity.
We will celebrate the sacred days of Navaratri and Durga Puja, keeping in mind the ideas of peace, unity and harmony to take the country to new heights.
We will celebrate Vijayadasamy.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
During the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he has done a very important role in winning gold medals for India.
At that time, it was only 10 minutes to get the result of the flame.
Dhyan Chand ji put 3 rounds in the ten minutes and I retaliated with the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a time for the sound of Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions on the website of MyGov or narendramodiop.
They are different.
This time, however, there were more demands that I should definitely comment on Rio Olympics.
I feel that this kind of interest in the Rio Olympics in the minds of the people, this kind of awareness and the pressure given to the Prime Minister of the country on this matter is very positive.
Even after the cricket, the people of India are very interested in other sports and are aware of this.
Sachin has written that this time you must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmaar in Mann Ki Baat.
One of these women belongs to North India, one from South India, one from East India, and other from the other from India.
It seems as if the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of proud of the country.
On MyGov website, Shikar Tagore has written that we can work even better in the Olympics.
He added, My best wishes to you for the two medals we have received in Rio, Honble Modi Sar.
There is a need to travel a long way in sports.
Our parents pay attention to reading today only.
They still see sports in the society with the point of view of time.
We have to change this idea.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who can give this work better than you
Likewise, Shri Sathyaprakash Mehra also wrote on the narendramodip - Mann Ki Baat was demanding extra-curricular activities.
In a way, this feeling reflected thousands of books.
It is true that we have no alternative idea that we cannot act according to our expectations.
We have two medals in the medals.
However, if you look at medals, you can see that for the first time, India's sportspersons have shown considerable skills.
Our Abinav Pindra ji was ranked 4th in the shooting category and he lost the medal in a very small difference.
Likewise, Sania Mirza-Rohan was involved in the tennis competition.
This time we are doing well in the Athletics category.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has been able to finalize the track field.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the dancers have succeeded in achieving the Knock Out position in Hockey.
Vikas Krishna Yadav came to the final stage in Baxing, but he could not get a bronze medal.
Many soldiers, for example, the activity of President Ashoka, Tathu Bognal and his Das was excellent.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have so far, we may have to get disappointed again.
I have also announced the setting up of a group.
The Government of India will deeply devote it and will examine what kind of activities are being done in the world.
Action plan will be implemented on which sector we can work well.
Our vision for 2020, 2025 and 2028 must be made.
I would like to urge all Indian citizens who are interested in sending their suggestions to the narendramodip.
Let the State Governments send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I was able to learn a lot from these small boys.
For me, the month of September 5 is not only a teacher's day but also a day of education.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 summit, it seems that I can't express my feelings in the voice of Mann Ki Baat today.
The more important is the mother in life, the more important is the teacher's place.
We have seen teachers who are more interested in us than us.
They dedicate their lives to their teachers and their students.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher as a sportsperson.
On the Teacher's Day, I salute Bullela Gopichand ji, to her divine spirit and to her entire commitment towards sports, and to her joy in the victory of the players.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli Radhakrishna's birth anniversary
He always tried to live as a teacher, even though he had reached a position in his life.
Not only this, he says that he always does not die a student in good teachers.
The books that he had read in that month and the curriculums were seen in it.
It has been observed that the whole month I did was not good in his sight.
Even today, he's like teaching me in the classroom.
Even today, he is giving me far-reaching education in a way.
When I see his signature at the age of 90, I am surprised to know how this maternal grandmother can be written by him at this old age
Because my signatures are so bad that if someone writes beautifully then my heart increases great respect.
You might have experienced like my experience.
Whatever benefits you have received from your teachers in your life, if you tell them worldwide then there will be a change in the vision of our teachers and a glory.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in society.
If you are taking some photographs with your teachers, if there is an event with your teacher then you must share with the narendramodip.
It is a matter of great value to see the contribution of the teachers of the country in view of the students.
But when we talk about the democracies, it is natural to return our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadar Tilak.
The tradition of commemorating the demographic square is the corpse of Lokmanya Tilak.
He has transformed the event of religion through a democracies into a day of national awareness and made it a social cultural day.
Democratic square has been deliberating on all the issues that touch social life, which have created a new upheaval in society and a new emergence.
Not only this, the mantra given by him is that the swarajya should be the center of our birth and the strength to freedom struggle.
Today, not only in Maharashtra, but also in the country, the democracy is not being celebrated socially.
They are discussing public matters, organising articles and competing for Kollam.
The scenes in this place have shown artistic lights to touch the society.
In a way, a campaign to create awareness for all is being carried out through socially democracies.
Lokmanya Tilak Swaraj has given us the majesty of our birth.
But we are now in a free India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
It is true that the celebrations are the forces of society.
They give a new life to the individual and the society.
Life without celebrations is not possible, but it has to be changed according to the need of the hour.
I can see that this time many people have written about the special heroic square and Durga Puja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankara Narayana Prasad, Mr. Modi ji and Plaster of Paris urge you not to use the idols of the child through Mann Ki Baat.
The statues made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable to the environment, but many others have expressed their concerns.
I urge all of you to relieve our old tradition by using the statues of children of earth or the statues of Durga.
Ganesh is a destructive man.
In such a situation, we should not build a Ganesh statue that makes us embarrass.
I don't know how you will take me to say, but I don't say so, many say.
An architect of Pune, Mr. Abijit Totbale, organisations of Kolhapur, Nisark Mitra, Vikyan Prabodini, Nisark Katta of Vidarpa, King Prabodini of Pune, Kirkawasa RA of Mumbai.
Several such organisations and individuals work hard to create statues of Ganesh and also campaign for them.
A democracies that do not harm the environment is also a social service.
There is a little more time for Durga Puja.
Employment through such mud-stone statues to the families of traditional idols
We will take a resolution that the environment will be protected because our ponds are made by the soil of rivers.
It is natural for all the people of the country to be proud when Mother Teresa, who served for the poor of India, is now being given a holy degree.
When we are from the saints, sages, sages and great men, we have got the good fortune to learn something every moment.
We have received something from them, we will learn more, we will understand the best.
My dear countrymen, when progress is a movement then how big will it change
People are seen in the form of Make-in-Charge.
In the past, the Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments, worked with the people to clean the Ganges and to make a successful effort to clean the Ganges.
We took the leaders of the villages living on the bank of the river Ganga to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th May this month.
And there were men among them, and women.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India, who have done this great job.
I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of 5 State Governments, who have helped in connecting the people with the power of the Ganga to take a very important step.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and sometimes there is a great respect in my mind for those who make such an opportunity.
On 15th July, in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh, 1.
More than 25 lakh students wrote a letter to their parents socially.
Some were in English, some in Hindi and some in the language of Chhattisgarh, in a letter to their parents, saying that they had to have toilets in their homes.
They had asked to set up a toilet and some children had written that even if you don't celebrate my birth anniversary this year, it would not be comfortable.
Children from seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
A woman named Malamma, a 16-year-old girl in Kopal district of Karnataka, has done Satyagraha against her family.
And he did nothing to save himself, or to wear good garments, or to eat sweets:
The belief of the girl child Mallamma is that we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the significance of the village leader Mohammad Shahfi, he arranged for Rs 18,000 and built a toilet within a week.
But everybody is somehow connected to it, everybody is making a golden contribution.
I also invite television channels to make such films and organise competitions.
There is no need for a big studio and a big camera to produce a film
Today, you can make a film using your mobile phone camera.
The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new programme called Akashwani Matri Channel in Kolkata.
Several people may have the question of starting a radio service as the President of the country.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are enjoying the same cultural heritage.
Here Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Bethar radio will exchange programmes across the border and people speaking Bengali on both sides will be happy to hear academics.
Akashwani has a great contribution to connecting people with people.
The President has inaugurated this.
I also express my gratitude to Bangladesh for fulfilling this work.
I also compliment the friends of Akashwani for their contribution to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you must have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I am a man like you.
That's why sometimes some of the emotional events touch my mind.
Such an emotional events provide innovative energy and new sensitivity, which give the people of the country the inspiration to achieve something.
A letter that came to me a few days ago touched my mind.
This was written by a mother of about 84 years old
If he didn't ask the retired teacher not to mention his name, I would certainly have mentioned his name.
I also broke the subsidies, and I forgot about it, as you asked to expel the subsidies for gas.
I believe that the letter written by the Prime Minister of India in terms of me is similar to the Padmasri Award.
You people of the country will be aware that I have written a letter from my side to all those who have opened the gas subsidy and some of my representatives will go and give it to those who have broken the subsidy.
I am trying to write a letter to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we were shocked by the dryness of the last year, but this month, the floods continued in August.
There were floods in some parts of the country again and again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the local organisations, the social welfare organisations, and the citizens have made an effort to make them self-sufficient.
But some of the tragic floods have been reminded.
Let us remember this year in August this year how the strength to live together and how the impact will be on everyone's shoulder to shoulder.
In August 2016, the political parties and 90 parties from all over the country, together with all those political parties in the Parliament, passed the law on GST.
Congratulations to all political parties for fulfilling this.
This is a wonderful example of the benefits of all political parties if they travel together in one direction.
Similarly, in connection with the situation in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together discussed the issue of Kashmir in one voice.
This led to the news of the world, the message of separatist forces, and their understanding of the people of Kashmir.
After interacting with all the political parties in Kashmir, one thing was well known, if I want to suppress it in two words, they are integrity and harm.
Both of these words were shined as the original mantra.
Whatever the lives of a young man in Kashmir, whether it is the lives of a young man or the lives of the security forces, whether it is ours or ourselves, the trust of all of us, the trust of 125 crore people of our country, the trust of all the people from the village leaders to the prime minister of the country.
One day, it must be a replies to these unprecedented children, who pursued small children to create unrest in Kashmir.
I believe in 125 crore people of the country.
Tomorrow morning, I got the opportunity to spend a few weeks with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, sports inspiration will increase the zeal and zeal of every young man across the country.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh of the world sports is going to be held in a few days.
The word Rio continues to resonate in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had organised an excellent arrangement to play, live and sport and develop.
Anything that can be encouraged by our sportspersons in any part of the country.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to be a postman to bring your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all make every sportsperson proud in the days to come and encourage their efforts.
Today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet of Punjab Central University.
Like that, many more poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have become songs and songs in every language, but today I want to share with you the poems written by Suraj ji.
Let the medal of gold, and the silver, and the brass.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your sentiments to all these sportspersons, and I extend my warm greetings to you, from my side and from the side of 125 crore Indians and our flag in Rio with pride.
Mr.
But when Abdul Kalam ji's name is taken, a future picture of a skilled India as a science, technology and missile is visible to us.
In that way, what is your government trying to realize Abdul Kalam's dreams
At the same time, if we want to make our path musical then we must do research and innovation, this is the life of technology.
If research and innovations are not created then how the stagnant water starts flowing and technology will become a burden for us.
If we are not doing research and innovation, we are dependent on ancient technologies, we will become a transformation in the changing age.
Therefore, the government is taking several initiatives to seek the breastfeeding of scientists, technologies and the breast feeding of research in our youth.
That's why I call upon you to set up Let us aim to innovate and innovate.
In this way, when I call AIM, it means that Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to build next generation innovators, then we should connect our youngsters with this scheme.
That's why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakhs will be provided and more than 10 lakhs will be provided for maintenance in five years wherever such magnitude centres are set up in schools.
Similarly, the Innovation Incubation Centre is directly connected.
If we have a powerful, sufficient incubation centre, we have a system that requires innovation, to examine and concentrate on start-ups.
While it is important to set up a new Creation Centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
Our daily life has problems in our eyes.
Now we have to find technical solutions.
As an Atal Grand Challenges, we have been inviting the younger generations of the country to conduct research and innovation and come to solve the problems of your eyes.
The Government of India wants to give special awards to the technology created to address our problems.
It is also a matter of great pleasure that when we talk about the Tinkering Lab, we have applied more than 13,000 schools and when we mentioned about the Creation Centre, more than 4000 non-educated organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I firmly believe that Abdul Kalam is a true tribute to research, innovation, finding solutions through technology and ease of liberating from our distresses to the problems that we face in our daily life.
Whatever our younger generations focus on these, their share in cooking the modern India of the 21st century will be so great that it will be a true tribute to Abdul Kalam jis memories.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, there was anxiety of famine in our minds and now rains are enjoying and news of floods is also coming.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working with the shoulders to help those affected by floods.
Though there are some hurdles due to rains, there is an increase in every human mind because the rain is the center of all our economic activity.
Sometimes the diseases that cause us to suffer from lifetime.
But if we are awakened, if we are awakened, then the ways to prevent them are easy.
Let's take the fever of dengue.
We can save us from dengue fever.
I urge all of you to be aware that even though the government, hospitals and doctors are doing their jobs, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our homes, in our families, and that there is no disease that can be caused by water.
Moreover, my countrymen, I want to turn your attention on a problem.
If life becomes so urgent and fast, sometimes we do not have time to think about us.
If you want a few weeks, you can get relief, but you must stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consultation.
If the doctor has advised to take 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please fulfil the recommendation in the days of the doctor's suggestion
If we leave that there is no need for health, then the micro-organisms are benefitted and they become stronger.
We call this antibiotic resistance in medical terms, therefore, it is important to follow the rules of taking them as much as possible as the antibiotics should be used.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotics sold at this time have been covered on the threshold of a red colour, it is to make you aware and take care of it.
When we talk about health, I want to add another thing to it.
The health of the pregnant mothers in our country is sometimes a lot of concern.
Every year about 3 crore women are pregnant in our country, but some mothers die during childbirth and some babies die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and sister have to die.
Though it is true that there has been a decline in the maternal mortality rate in the last decades, even today, the lives of pregnant mothers are not protecting us more.
She doesn't know what kind of child would be the victim of blood deficiency, infections related to delivery and high blood pressure.
In view of all this, the Government of India has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matridva Abhiyan (PMSMA) - the safe motherhood scheme of the Prime Minister.
My doctors brothers and sisters cannot dedicate themselves to the poor for 12 days in a year
In the past, many have written a letter to me.
I believe you will surely join you in this.
My dear countrymen, today the concerns of climate change, global warming and environment are increasing all over the world.
Discussions are going on between the people of the country and the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
And in the singing, Lord Krishna, said to Achvath, Sarvarukshanaam, that is, I am a tree of palms.
There is no vegetation that is, Sukrayanio, Nasti, or no medicinal properties.
The example of a woman from Pune attracted my attention, which gave my mind.
The synonym of the Mahabharata has been said that trees also perform the obligations of McCatchelvam in heaven, and Sonal accepts the challenge not only to his mother's will, but also to fulfill the wishes of the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahadre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Jhunnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made.
While I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have seen a large number of pilgrims coming to the Amba Devi Temple during the month of Bhadra.
Once a social service organisation has given a pride to those who are worshipped in the temple, if you take it to your village then your mother will continue to give you her blessings.
Millions of thousands of pilgrims who have come here gave millions of trees that year.
Even temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of Prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement on tree plantation.
I ask my farmer brothers again and again why shouldn't we increase the trees of coconut instead of wasting our lands by setting trees on the borders of our regions
Today, we have to import united trees from abroad to build houses and chains in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
Even there, a massive forest festival has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small fact that there are 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
Those who knew about the land of Rajasthan know how big it is.
It has been decided to increase greenery by 50 by 2029 in Andhra Pradesh.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular heritage.
In Gujarat this year, projects have been set up in several ways such as peacock forests, Ekta forests and Sheeth forests, in which work was done between crores of trees and plants.
In many areas, international agreements are being made on foreign tours, such as political diplomacy, non-connected organs, trade discussions and security-related talks.
But in terms of me, the visit to South Africa is in a way a pilgrimage.
It is natural to recall the memories of Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela when you think of South Africa.
When the words of ahims, love and forgiveness of the world come in the ears, the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will be seen before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to go to the Phoenix residential place called Sarvodaya, where Gandhiji lived.
I had the good opportunity to travel to the Peter Maritsburg railway station, where Gandhiji had travelled on a train or the train that had made the seed of transforming Mohandas into Gandhiji.
This time I had the opportunity to meet many important people who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
Nelson fought shoulder to shoulder with Mandela and spent 20-25 years with him in prisons.
In a way, they had sacrificed their entire youth, and I had a great deal of sightseeing the great people of Nelson Mandela, Ahmad Kathada ji, Lalu, Sipa ji, George Pessos ji, Roney Castles.
When I was interacting with them, when they were asking their prison experiences, there was no bitterness in their minds, no tragic appearance.
The feeling of all equal, all of us is the way to bring us to a bright future.
Come, let us proudly recall these Indians who have lived in the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a newspaper that a woman hiding in a fraud and absurd email net lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
I am sorry to be a woman and her family.
I want to know what your views are about such fraudulent emails.
A new technique that uses technology is spreading all over the world.
As technology plays a major role in the economy, its misuse is also increasing.
If you want to get a big amount from abroad, if you want to get it, then put 2 lakh rupees in bank accounts for the solution of the customs, this person took 2 lakh rupees in his life and sent it to a person who did not know the name of his name.
Anyone who can manufactur and send a fake letter balls, get your credit card number and debit card number, through technology, cleansing your bank account.
This is a new kind of fraud and this is a digital fraud.
I want to save us from this fury, I want to be awake, if such letters come then we must immediately share them with friends and help them to be aware.
My dear countrymen, when the Parliament session is going on, I have the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
I had a pleasant experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar came and met me.
Encouraging the student was running on the shore, they brought a very big alphabet, shouting joy in their faces.
They brought the films that beauty the Aligarh railway station with them.
They built a layer garden built by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new shape for the station.
If you also have the opportunity to go to Aligarh then you must visit the railway station.
I have this kind of information related to several railway stations in India that people from those regions are engraving their regional arts in the walls of the railway stations.
I feel a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can transform through their contribution.
My best wishes to all those working in the country, especially to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of many festivals starts in our country on the occasion of rainy season.
And you shall also be in your houses, and in the releases.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, during the Raksha Bandhan, you cannot provide Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Jeevan Bima Yojana to mothers and sisters of the country
Imagine, brothers and sisters, give a prize in your life to really feel safe.
Whether we have laid down a woman in our houses to cook or to work in the houses or to be the daughter of some poor mother.
Is it not possible for them to be awarded the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Suraksha Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Life Insurance Scheme during this Raksha Bandhan festival
My dear countrymen, many of us will be born after independence.
We can create such an environment.
The Independence Day is not the programme of the governments, it should be the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we must celebrate this festival as a festival.
I want to do something positive in collaboration with the theory of patriotism.
You can tell the people of the country that I invite you to speak out of the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I don't want to have the opinions of the Prime Minister from the ramparts of Red Fort.
The Red Fort is being described from the fort and it should be the feelings of 125 crore people.
Several events are being organised on holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages
A few days ago, somebody told me that the village Panchayat and the village people from Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra had sentimentally reached the problem of water.
There may be a number of villages that want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, they have changed the entire tropical system.
Whatever crop is used, it may be black or waste, it is decided that it will not be able to cultivate such crops.
It's easy to ask, but it's not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers, if there is a lot of water for black pepper, don't move.
They all cultivate fruits and vegetables, i.e., they cultivated only what the lowest water requires.
They will clarify that today they have succeeded in their own efforts to address the problem of water through a variety of initiatives such as drop water conservation, rain water conservation, water recharge or rain water recharge.
Well, I have spoken about a small village, Hivere Bazar, but there may be many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to the people of this village and for the great work you have achieved.
Someone told me about Gorva Gorva village Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
I think it is a news for the world when the Government of India brings water to the ladder through trains.
If there is a good news from somewhere, it is human nature to feel that the whole embarrassment is lost.
This time, I have heard the news that there is a possibility of 106 to 110 percent of the rains, so I feel like some very happy news has come.
Though the rainy season is still time, the news of good rains has also refreshed.
But, my countrymen, however, it gives me the joy that there will be a good rain, it also provides the opportunity and challenges.
Can we still start the movement to save the water from the village
The farmers need soil and it helps them in the field of crops.
Why shouldn't we put the soil on the lakes of the villages in the fields
When the soil of the fields increases, the water conservation level will also increase.
What if you put stones and soil on the ways to the outskirts of the black cements, and black squirrels
Whenever I tell you one thing, whenever we go to the birthplace of Gandhiji, we can see different places there, one of them is to see.
That is, how the ponds were built below the house 200 years ago to save the water and how clean the water is.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments had come, several schemes were formed and the integrated money was spent, because of this, it is natural to raise such questions in the minds of millions of people in the country as a model of brother Kumar Krishna.
Religious believers consider the Ganges as a household provider.
The Ganga gives us the job and the Ganga gives us the energy to live.
There is a pace of economic activity in the country due to the movement of the Ganges.
A Bhagiradhan brought us the Ganges but hundreds of crores of devotees are required to protect it.
People cannot succeed in the work without any contribution, so we all have to become a Changing Agencies for cleanliness and transformation.
It must be repeated and reminded.
Several efforts are being made on behalf of the government.
Efforts are being made to provide full support to all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to unite social and clean organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial pollution.
Every day, the solid wastes are mixed through the canals.
In the coming days, many more places will be able to remove this poultry and apply machinery and the people living on the banks of the Ganges will experience the benefits.
I feel that this will have good results too.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the districts of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the terms of ero liquid discharge for the past few days.
The expulsion of Black Liquid from paper plants has almost completely ended.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and there has been an increase in awareness.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges, but also on the far-flung southern coasts, they ask us whether the Ganga is clean or not.
It is the belief of the people that will certainly lead to success in cleaning the Ganges.
People are offering themselves to clean the Ganges.
This system is being implemented in a very excellent manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
We have celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April, and on 24th April, we are celebrating Panchayati Raj Day.
This is a good thing that the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments of India, carried out the movement from 14th April to 24th April in collaboration with the Government of India, from 14th April to 24th April, from the birth anniversary of any man who gave us the Constitution of India, from the birth anniversary of his birth anniversary, to the greatest connected villages of the Constitution.
Today, on April 24, I am going to celebrate the Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand, which is our majority of tribal brothers and sisters, this movement has created a massive awareness.
How to strengthen rural democratic institutions in all corners of India
How to make villages self-reliant
How do the villages suppress their development plans
Several programmes in many villages of India may have been held in ten days, which may be less.
I convey my best wishes to all the State Governments and the rural leaders, who have used it as an opportunity for the development of villages, for the welfare of villages and for the development of the villages.
There has been awakening in the villages, it is the responsibility of India's rise.
The foundation of Indias rise is in rural development.
Therefore, we are focusing on the upliftment of the village and we will reach the desired results.
Development has been essential for the past several years in the education sector.
Today, if there is a first dream for parents in every family then it should be a quality education for children.
The idea of homes and vehicles is all later.
This feeling is progressing in the minds of the people of the country like India, this is the biggest strength.
That's why I request my parents to talk to the children in a detailed manner about the practices of the school by taking some time.
If something gets up in the mind then go to school and ask the teachers.
This awareness must be the participant of the people to reduce our educational disorders.
All the governments in our country have been paying attention to education and every government has made its own efforts.
It is also true that there has been a lot of time in the attention of our people to establish educational institutions, to expand educational institutions, to establish schools, colleges, to include teachers and to go to school.
In a way, an attempt to spread education was preferred and it is also important.
However, the importance of expansion is more important than that of our educational system.
We have done the greatest work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary objective is to provide good education to all through the educational movement.
It is true that we have to take a long journey.
But if 125 crore people have decided then a long journey will also be possible.
It is very important that we make fundamental changes according to Sharmila ji.
The universities of India can also be globally competitive universities.
The importance of education is as important as skills as well as the role of technology in education is going to be very important.
I am confident that far-reaching education and technology will make our education easier and in some time the results will be visible to the eyes.
I salute the Prime Minister and speak to Mona Karna from Bijnor.
In today's phase, sports is also very important with education for the youth.
They need to have a team spirit and be a good leader, which will lead to their overall development.
I tell this through my experience, because I have been in the Indian Commonwealth Organisation, which has had a good impact on my life.
This required a lot of integration.
Their vastness gave me a lot of satisfaction and they had a lot of enthusiasm and need to do something.
I know that at one time, I have been in the National Students' Force and I know that there is a national outlook through such organizations.
I have experienced the benefits in my childhood, I have to fill a new energy in these organisations and give a new boost.
This time I have some things before them.
In this season, why should not our youth and all the organisations be involved in the greater water conservation work
How many circles and how many districts we can prevent open defecation.
My dear countrymen, I have to talk about what we all need to think today.
I see this astonishing thing.
You will be aware that the political condition of our country was as much as the party will provide gas cylinders as the discussions of the last several elections.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing to reduce subsidies, causing a number of groups to be formed and gave advice and decisions on subsidies reduction.
Several crore rupees have been spent in the operation of these groups.
But today my breasts are filled with pride for the people of my country.
However, more than 80 percent of these crore people went to the distributors, sequenced, written and opened their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government refrains from any tax system, then it will come to television and newspapers for a week.
Because they have forced political leaders to think in a new perspective.
Even today, the country's economists are forced to think in a new perspective.
It is an event beyond their calculations, even to the world's economists who advance various prospects.
This must be considered at some point.
This is an extraordinary thing that if one crore households have abandoned subsidies, instead of providing gas cylinders to one crore poor households, the rest of the households, if they seem to be ordinary in the supervision, then how much can be achieved while working with confidence in the people.
I urge all the political leaders to say something indeed by trusting the people wherever we are going.
May the benefits that you cannot even think.
We have to travel in this direction.
For instance, I thought about why the third stage and the fourth stage of worker should conduct a direct examination and why we should not believe in their selection values.
I am supposed to know that there are no ticket examiners in some railway stations.
Let us believe in the people of the country, we can do many such tests.
Once we believe in the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by any political leaders and one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written to me - Good News everyday, good saving every day, tell your officers that every day one should tell you about a good thing.
The worst news in every newspaper and media is breaking News.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent a letter to me, saying that on Monday we would not even publish a bad news and publish a positive message.
It is true that there has been an atmosphere of positive news.
Everyone feels good news and real news.
Whatever a well-known person gives a special message, however beautiful it is, however extraordinaryly explains it, more benefits are available through good news.
Good news is encouraging good things.
The truth is that as much as we strengthen the benefit, the place for evils is reduced.
If we take the island, the darkness will cease on its own, it will certainly go away.
You can also contribute in it.
Ravi ji, you have given good advice but please don't be angry at me.
Together with us, we will take positive initiatives, we will be able to speak positively and we will be able to take positive initiatives.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
The Kumbh Mela can be a tourist attraction.
Many of the people of the world have been unaware of the fact that millions of people are coming to the bank of the river for several days.
The festival is finished in a peaceful and peaceful environment.
These events are institutionally accomplishing the greatest standards as participants in the programme management point of view.
I have been paying attention to the films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela for the last two days.
I want the tourism sector of the Government of India and the tourism sectors of the State Governments to conduct a photographic competition on this occasion.
People can ask you to welcome the most important photographs.
This can definitely be done.
When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me in the middle, he told me that special attention has been paid to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival but also the aim of the people from there is to keep the idea of cleanliness in their minds.
While I acknowledge that during the Kumbh Mela, it is a spiritual festival, I believe that it can also become a social opportunity.
How can we increase our love for water, how can we admire the water and use the Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water storage.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I think that you shall speak to me, but I urge you to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to yourselves, and to the voice of mind.
You might remember that last time I had spoken about a book with the stories of Premchand ji and whoever can read it, share your thoughts about it through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have expressed their views on the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But now I have to acknowledge that I do not have enough time to read many books.
But I feel that we have to take forward the experience that we have received in the last one month.
Friends, I have touched the voice of Mann Ki Baat on water conservation, but even before this, I feel that the matter of water conservation is very popular to the common man.
It is a matter of water that has drowned the whole country for a few days.
Several unprecedented efforts are being made to influencing water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information on traditional methods.
The media has also overthrown many nutritional movements regarding water conservation.
I am very happy to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the North-East, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
Farmers are being encouraged to afford low water consumption in Haryana, which is not harmful to the farmers.
Why shouldn't we use these festivals to protect water
Friends, some things in life fill us with zeal.
This, especially the achievements of children and their achievements, gives us a new energy and encouragement.
And the things that I shall say now shall make you one another with pride and zeal.
We all know that a word called cancer is so impossible in the world.
When death is at the doorsteps, these ten children have not only left cancer in their struggle for life-saving, but have also honoured the name of the country because of their marvellous acts.
This month, in Moscow, the World Children's Winners Games won World Children's Competitions.
The event was organised for competitions like shooting, swimming, swimming, swimming, timelines and table tennis.
These ten winners of our country won medals and some of them won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that Chandrayaan II will give you the pride and pride of India's success in space.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga of Kolkata and B.
Many like Arvind Rao have been asking the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about this Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
The year 2019 must be said to be Indias best year in terms of space.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March, after which Chandrayaan 2.
We were unable to talk more about the importance of A-Sat in the electoral fray.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the earth in just 3 minutes.
On 22nd July, the Bong Chandrayaan rose in the heart of pride all over the country.
Chandrayaan 2 - This goal is important in different aspects.
Chandrayaan 2 will further boost our understanding of the moon.
We have to face temporary recessions even in our lives
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am going to forward the information about a very interesting competition for the students and the youth of the country, and I invite our youth to participate in this competition.
Knowledge on Space, Indias Space Programme and Science Technology will be the blueprint of the competition.
For example, what to do in the rocket delivery, how to rotate the satellite, what are we getting from the artisans and what are the A-Sat
On the MyGov website, information on the competition will be held on August 1st.
I call on my young friends and students...
I urge all schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to win your school.
I inspire all the students to join it.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take maximum number of students from every state to Sriharikota at its cost
Moreover, in the month of September, they will also get the opportunity to see the landscape of Chandrayaan.
The voice of our minds has given momentum to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Similarly, efforts are also being made for cleanliness and inspires Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today has set new standards of cleanliness with the help of everyones contribution.
I don't say that we have achieved the ideals of cleanliness, but the success of the Swachhata Mission from open defecation to public is the strength of 130 crore people.
But we're not gonna stop with this.
This movement is now traveling from unhealthy to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know about Yogesh Chaini and his team through media.
Yogesh Chaini, an engineer, has returned to the country to serve Bharat Mata by breaking his work in the US.
Some time ago, he took a challenge not only to clean Delhi but also to change the beauty.
He collaborated with his team and started his work from the pipelines in Lodhi Garden.
You will remember how all the streets of Prayag Raj city were mixed with paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
I knew that Yogesh Saini ji and his team had shown their handloom there.
We feel this experience in the beauty of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
The principle of wealth from waste should be strengthened in our society and it is important to be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting idea in MyGov.
Mohammed Aslam, a resident of Shopian region of Jammu and Kashmir, has registered this.
I love Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad to know that I have contributed positively in the programme to bring together the society in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The programme was organised in June.
Mohammed said that this would be the first action plan to directly drive people with the government.
Several more things have been added to this project to make it more interesting.
Sports competitions were held for children under the Khelo India scheme.
They were awarded sports equipment, workshops for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment, listed and tribal certificates.
In a way, this event is a development festival, a mass participation festival, a good festival of public awareness.
A large number of people participated in this development festival of Kashmir.
It is a matter of great joy that the programme for returning to the village had been done in the rural areas, while the government officials who reached such far-flung villages had climbed on the difficult hilly paths and traveled for one or two days.
These officers also visited the border villages along the borders of Sadasar and borders, not only without any fear, but also in the worst areas of Shopian, Bulwama, Gulkanva and Anantnag districts.
They have spent more than two days in these villages, if they were welcomed and affected by many officers.
It is a matter of great pleasure to organise Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, to ensure a large number of peoples participation and to make their plans.
New commitment, new enthusiasm and wonderful consequences.
It also makes it clear that all those who are trying to seek obstacles and harvest in the development journey, and their illiteracy has never succeeded.
My dear countrymen, how do you know that Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, who has been awarded the Gyanpeeth Award, has written about the period of his life in a poem
People from different cultures and languages across India are happy to celebrate Maritime in their own way.
If we surround us in this season, the earth will be seen as if we have fought some green war on him.
A new energy erupts all around.
In this sacred month, many devotees take a vow, take a pilgrimage to Amarnath, many people are eating and waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami with great enthusiasm.
During this time, Raksha Bandhan is also coming out of love for brothers and sisters.
It is a matter of great pleasure that when we talk about the period of our period, this time, the number of devotees has been participating in the Amarnath Yatra for more than four years.
More than 3 lakh devotees have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July.
The number of people who participated in this holy journey for a total of 60 days in 2015 has been deducted in just 28 days.
I would like to congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their hospitality after the success of the Amarnath pilgrimage.
All those who have returned after the journey are attracted to the people of the state by the enjoyment and sensitivity of the people.
All this will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
It is said that even in Uttarakhand this year, Sardham has started a sacred journey and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple in just one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural disaster in 2013, a number of people have made such a pilgrimage.
I urge you to visit some places of beauty in the season and somewhere in the country.
Nobody will have a greater mission than a tourism and a sacred journey to see the beauty of our country and the feelings of the people of our country.
May this beautiful and survival month of the period give you new energy, new expectations and new aspirations.
Likewise, in August, the memories of the uit India movement are being faced.
On the other hand, there is a widespread wealth in different parts of the country and in many areas people of the country are suffering from floods.
When we see the rain on television, we see only a perspective - wherever we see floods, filled water and transport stagnation.
I will come back after waiting for a month.
Today, the people of Christian society all over the world will be celebrating Estate Triday.
Today, when India is dancing with Australia, I convey my best wishes to both the teams.
India won Gold in the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked 4th in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have turned down to the lowest ranking.
It is also difficult to ignore the extent to which our position in the FIFA ranks has fallen.
Be it EPL or Spanish League, be it the Indian Super League lamps, today I see that the interest of Indian youth is increasing on the footsteps.
The youth of India are watching television to get more information about the footwear.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity to take the cattle to every village and every street.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2017 is such an opportunity that in this year, we must try to innovate and innovate about footwear among the youth.
I consider this as an opportunity to brand India globally.
You will be planning to travel on holidays, my friends and students.
Very few people go abroad, most of them travel for five days and seven days in every state.
Someone leaves their states and goes to other states.
There is a doubt that there will be a district that I cannot go to India.
There is a great strength for tourism in creating our lives and now Indian youth are keen to travel and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't want to travel on the way to the old model, they don't want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think it's a good identity.
There is also a case in our area that others will run away on their own if they blacken their hands.
But it is a pleasure to create a tourism surroundings with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than 10,000 people have experienced a concerted coal mine tourism surrounding Savaner village near Nagpur.
It provides an opportunity to see an innovation.
Can you contribute to cleanliness when you go to other places during this holiday
It may not be done very scientificly, but it's true to happen.
Can you also work as a tourist destination in a strong collaboration with the idea of cleanliness at the tourism center
India's tourism is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people decide together to strengthen our tourism sector then we can capture the world.
Come, let us move towards this direction.
My young friends, I don't like the situation that there were some holidays.
You also think of this perspective.
Can you leave your holidays, the great years of life, and their glory be lost
I'm offering a view to your child.
Can you develop a capabilities during your holidays, cannot you add a new thing to the pride of your governance
If you don't know swimming, if I learn swimming during the holidays, if I don't know how to run the cycle then I will learn to run the cycle.
Even today, if I am tapping with two fingers in the calculations, can I do the symptoms
How many kinds of capabilities are there to promote our governance, isn't it
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Think now, there is no need for a big deal, no trainee is required, no money is required, no big expenditure is required.
This is how I will interact with other friends.
I am confident that you will definitely do this and tell me what you have learned newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Prime Minister, during the last summer holidays, you should warm the summer for the birds, so we should keep water in a balcony or in a cup on the roof of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which I was friendly with a lot of birds.
This time again, I urge you to express this in the voice of your mind.
He has telephone connections and reminded me of a good job.
I was asking you to fill the water in the soil vessels outside your house in the summer.
Abi has told me that he is doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds have loved him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the greatest poets in the world of Hindi literature, had a lot of sin on birds.
In his poems, I will not let you go far, and I will fill the pieces with cereals, and I will fulfil the cool wine anywhere.
Shilpa Coke from Mysore has put forward a very minute idea.
Have we ever given them water to drink
I am grateful to you, Shilpa, you have put forward a very emotional idea.
My brothers and sisters, you must have heard more about Digital India.
Some people may have this digital India as a matter of youth in some city.
If you pay the app for these farmers' amenities then you will get all the information related to agriculture and climate in your handloom.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets and what is the best harvesting trend, how pesticides are fit.
If you ask any questions about them, they answer it or make you aware.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to make the App available to these farmers in their mobile phones.
We have tried to create wealth for water conservation through Manreka.
There may be a number of villages that have created such awareness in the country, be it the premier farmers, be it the citizens of many awareness.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deaths occur due to diabetes.
There are two types of diabetes, one type one and the other type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, hereditary, mother-father, as well as children.
Type 2, because of habits, because of age, because of obesity.
Since diabetes has become a worldwide concern, it has been set up as the center of World Health Day on 7th.
Our lifestyle is a major reason for this.
Physical hard work is decreasing.
Can we work on diabetes in our lives by imagining on 7th April
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check-up by getting embarrassed.
It is known that there has been diabetes for a long time only after the situation has worsened.
There is a shortage in our country in comparison to the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
This disease can be decided by proper treatment .
India should be free from these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to overcome diabetes and eradicate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, many important events are going to be held in April, especially on 14th April, on the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
On April 14 this year, I got the privilege of visiting Babasaheb Ambedkar's birthplace Mhow.
Baba Saheb has given us all that he needs to be an excellent citizen.
By passing through the way he showed, and being a good dweller, we can show him a great tribute.
Vikram will start the year in a few more days.
New Year is celebrated in different states in different forms.
My new year greetings to everyone.
Whenever you hear the voice of my mind, I have said this thing that you know that you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can hear it at a comfortable time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am happy to join you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the Easter Festival.
My young friends, all of you will be on one side of the election.
There's a wonderful inspiration.
You might be aware that in the next year 2017, India will be hosting the FIFA Under-17 World Cup competition in our country.
What do I mean is insisting that the interest of the footsteps increases, but when such a great opportunity lays the doors of India, can we only be obliged to fulfil our duties
Last time also I had requested you to welcome the photographs of the place where you are going.
Millions of foreigners of the country have done the work that the tourism sector has not been able to do, the work that our cultural sector cannot do, the state governments and the Indian government cannot do.
It's really enjoyable to see all the photographs they have shown.
We have to take this task forward and do it this time, but this time we have to add something else.
Not only sending pictures but also showing your architecture and visiting new places, many things can be understood.
India is a diverse country.
If you start traveling once you want to see, you will be traveling all over the life and you will be enjoying it.
We generally think we should stay away from coal mines.
When we look at the films about the people, we think what's going to happen there
I am confident that my young friends will definitely be helpful in this work.
Be it government or organisations, be it society, be it citizens, let us all work together.
Your governance will be identified by it and your self-confidence will increase in abundance.
They come to our houses to sell milk, those who sell newspapers, those who are postalists, sometimes those who sell utensils or those who sell garments pass.
Have we ever asked if you want to finish their thirst while the heat of the summer remains
Only then can one drop of rain water be used without waste.
Initiatives of farming for farmers are very important.
But if there is no water, we should also think of what is the country's people.
This time you might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes have been making efforts to create irrigation ponds.
I still remember that people are scared as soon as I hear the name of TB at my younger age.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis then the right treatment is important and complete treatment is important.
If you leave the treatment in the middle, the disease will come back.
And whenever you have time, you can hear the voices of the old mind, you can hear it in your language.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In a way, this is a sound of my heart in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat event will be held in 2016.
In a way, every festival is going to leave the hope that when the next festival will come.
Sometimes, India can also be called the economy that is driven by festivals.
They are due to the economic activity of the people under the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas Festival and my best wishes for the coming year 2016.
May there be a lot of joy and joy for all of you in 2016, let the new enthusiasm, new temperament and new commitment take you all to new heights.
Let the world be hot, and the natural disasters, and the shame of man.
What is more joy than this, that human society should live peacefully by getting rid of all these
Chawley Savarkar ji is a tourism season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas celebrations
I welcome Ganesh ji's ideas as clean as our tourist destinations are.
I am carrying Ganesh ji's ideas among the people.
If the guests come to our houses, then we feel like cleaning and cleaning the house immediately when we come to the tradition of visiting the guests as a god.
Similarly, we must keep the tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations of our country clean and clean, and we need to add special strength.
I am glad that there are colors of news from all over the country about cleanliness.
From the outset, I have been conveying my appreciation to the media friends on this matter.
Because they are looking for small and good things and taking it to the people.
I would like to share with you that now I had to read the message that he has built hundreds of toilets only in Bhojpura village, considering this work as a sacred thing.
The country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the continuous efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress, and the country is also progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills, increasing employment opportunities
Life Insurance Schemes for citizens, banking facilities, global trade without seats and setting up of new industries are being done on one hand.
All the comfortable families who cannot even go near the banks can now get loans easily through the Mudra scheme.
Now the Indians have started to understand that the milk of Yoga art has begun to grow all over the world.
When the whole world celebrated International Day of Yoga, the feeling of how proud our country was, didn't we
This feeling will happen only when our thoughts and thoughts are large.
And it came to pass, when his mother opened the mouth of Jesus, that when he opened, who could forget to see her eggs there
Similarly, Yoga Day has shown us the importance of India as Indians.
Now the talk of cleanliness is echoing in every household.
Be it a farmer, be it a poor man, be it a young man, be it a mother, be it a renewable change in their lives, the feeling of bringing electricity to those villages will be a great pleasure for the government officials who are working to bring electricity to those villages.
I can't do everything alone alone
But when I talk about this, don't I have to contribute to this
An ordinary citizen can also join me with app called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I am sharing simple things in this.
I am happy that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us join us in the matters of the interests of the common man and bring it to the common man and give them the imagination to get their excellent things.
My dear young friends, on August 15, I presented a fundamental idea of Startup India and Standup India from the Red Fort.
Thereafter, all the sectors of the government were put into consideration.
Can India become a start-up capital
Startup India has brought a great opportunity for the youth of Standup India.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will start the work on Start-up India and Stand-up India on the entire street.
We have a sustainable idea about start-ups that the start-ups are the only people in the digital world and in the field of information technology.
We must make changes in this regard, keeping in mind the needs of India.
The intellectual skills of our younger generations spread all over the country.
This startup should not be left only in some cities, such as Stand-up India, which cannot be spread across the corner of India.
Therefore, I urge all the State Governments to take this project forward.
On 16th January, I will definitely share this with you in detail.
I am eagerly awaiting your ideas.
My dear young friends, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on 12th January.
There are millions of people in this country like me.
From 1995 to January 12, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as National Youth Day.
The events will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
I urge my young friends to send your views directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to understand and understand what is in your mind.
He was a visually impaired person from Ahmedabad, who celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet people like him in our lives, there will be integrated thoughts in our minds.
The perspective of human beings like this will be based on our ideas.
There is no doubt that there is a significance for words.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat programme, I was planning to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially because of the severe floods in Chennai, I had to go there, I could not participate in this event.
Even though I was unable to participate in this event, I had a lot of ideas in my mind.
Innovations are needed to facilitate schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible vehicles, lifts, braille languages, etc.
They shall not be drowned in crowns and killed.
Didn't the schemes be made even for the common man and the poor
A few days ago, efforts were made to facilitate the beneficiaries to carry out the programme's amenities.
The subsidy for gas cylinders is being provided in our country.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a small change in granting subsidy to know whether or not the subsidy is reaching the real beneficiaries or not at the right time.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Pahal Gas Scheme.
These 15 crore beneficiaries have received direct subsidies to bank accounts.
This is happening without intermediaries, Sipariso and any probability for corruption.
On the one hand, the movement of Aadhaar Identification Card, on the other hand, opening of Jan Dhan Bank Account, and on the other hand, the Central State Governments are collaborating on the list of beneficiaries and linking it to Aadhaar Identification Card and Bank Account.
There were colours of integrated charges regarding the project.
In many places, money is being directly credited to the bank accounts of workers working.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been deposited directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries regarding about 35,40 projects.
My dear countrymen, a golden account for the Republic of India on 26th January.
It is a very pleasant link to Babasaheb Ambedkar ji's 125th birth anniversary.
We have to take this forward.
During the elections, more advertisements such as 'the sacred obligation' will be published and layers will be written on the walls.
We will talk more about all the obligations in the elections, but why shouldn't we talk about the same obligation in daily life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, cannot we organise a poetry competition, poetry competition, dialogue competition in schools, colleges, villages and cities, in many societies and associations, on 26th January
When the 125 crore people of the country take a step by compassionately, you can imagine how big a history will be created.
On January 26, when we celebrate the President, cannot we clean and decorate the idols of the country's leaders and their surrounding places by the citizens, through school-children
I urge you to do this as citizens.
We reflect the sensitivity of those leaders who are feeling very commendable in keeping the statues.
Can we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On 26th January, we will join us in this effort.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival is being started.
There is a different place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes the festivals are also beneficial to remove wounds and sometimes they are inspiring.
But sometimes when there are troubles in the festival days, they are sorry.
From every corner of the world, reports of natural disasters are continuing.
There are reports of disaster events even without questioning yet.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and rescue operations in the entire house.
The central government has always been working shoulder to shoulder.
I am sure that even after all these complications, Tamil Nadu will become faster and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But there is a feeling that we face such a difficult situation all around and there is a change in coming.
Until about 15 years ago, the natural disaster was associated with the agriculture sector because there was a natural disaster only with dryness and famine.
Governments, people's society, citizens and small and big organizations have to work scientifically in the field of skill development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had to interact with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawas Sharif.
I also advised the South Asian countries to collaborate on a joint action to be prepared to face the disaster.
I am glad that a seminar on the best ways to address the disaster and a poll in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I am talking to Lakhvinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab.
We are engaged in agriculture and many are also guided by agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are making natural farming.
It is a matter of great pleasure that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified, but this is not happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is usually the whole of India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural wastes after the crop.
Earlier, we did not know about the evil caused by such burning, and all do so, so do I.
As a result of this, it continued to grow and today it has been associated with climate change.
After the impact of this crisis began to reach cities, people's protests began to shout.
In that way, the concern you have expressed is real.
In the first phase, our peasant friends should be trained and they should explain the truth.
After this result, the burning of farm wastes can save time, reduce the complications and make the land ready for the next time.
But this is not the right norm.
Farm wastes are also very valuable after cutting.
They are natural routes.
We're losing them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, they can be inhabited in the cattle.
Secondly, when we burn them, the layer on the ground becomes red.
Listen to me, my farmer brothers and sisters, Look at one moment, our bones are strong, our hearts work well, our kidneys work smoothly, but if the skin on the body is burnt then can we live
As the skin of our body is burnt, we cannot survive our lives, even if we burn the skin of our mother, the skin of the earth is burnt, the layer on our earth is burnt.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in waste management.
They shared their unique experiences to me.
They had to spend Rs. 50,000, 15,000 per hectare to remove livelihoods after they had earlier cut their lives.
There was no work until the ropes had to be taken into the tractors.
Last time I had spoken about organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
In this regard, I had mentioned the NOTO free phone number.
Many prominent film actress Ravina Tandon joined them.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What else can be more than that
The Registration Centre for National Level Organ Transformation (NLOT) was launched on 27th November, 2018 with details of patients awaiting organs and organ donations.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this sector and I believe that it will help those who are needed at the right time.
As long as there is no one to donate, this help is not available in any way.
I had already said that on December 3, we are going to commemorate the Day of Divyangjans.
Physically, physically handicapped persons are immense courage and immense potential.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as celestial materials, the heart feels sad.
Sometimes there is a feeling of grace and compassion on them.
But if we change our vision, if we correct the vision that we see them, they will be our ideologue and the achievements will become an inspiring force for us.
Their commitment, their confrontation of life, their ability to transform the complications into compassionate, thirsty and commendable.
Today, I want to talk about Javed Ahmad, who was 40-42 years old.
In 1996, militants killed Javed Ahmad in Kashmir.
But Javed Ahmad did not accept defeat.
The wounds that caused terrorism did not make him crushed.
There was no part of his provocation, a person who did not commit any crime had such a punishment, his young man was lost, but there was no anger or anger in his mind.
Despite not collaborating with the body, he has dedicated himself to the education of children for the last 20 years.
As a social worker, as an awakening citizen, he is today making a peaceful revolution as the sovereignty of the handicapped.
Is Javed ji's life sufficient for all Indians to be sensitized
I extend my best wishes to Javed ji's blessings and his spirit of dedication on the 3rd of December.
Even today, because of the lack of time, I have been able to talk about Javed ji, but the sensitivity of such sensitivity is brightening and encouraging livelihood.
In the same way, on December 3, we have to get inspiration from them.
In many cases, we have to work based on the governments.
The middle class, the middle class, the bottom of the middle class, the bottom people, the underprivileged, the deprived, the oppressed, all of them are constantly associated with the government and government-related organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they are likely to have a bad experience with government employees somehow.
These couples are spending their wealth in their resting life in the development of the poor.
The total population of Dentaga, the smallest village in the Balasore district of Odisha, belongs to tribals.
The poorest of the village is a condition that is suffering from malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA worker from this village, decided that I would ensure that no one from this Dentaka dies of Malaria.
He has overthrown the struggle against Malaria and prepared to confront the entire village.
Everything like this may be in the country.
You must read and recommend not only to others.
The creative power is the largest power.
Distribute good events related to this, share these e-books and conduct consultations.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned about climate change.
On December 14, National Energy Conservation Day.
Several projects are being implemented on behalf of the government.
The LED bulb movement is progressing towards the end.
On the full moon day, I had told you to tied the street lights and wet the whole moon for an hour.
A friend had sent a connection to my sight and I had the opportunity to see it.
I had come to share this with you.
He is trying to give light to the poor by using solar energy, fighting with darkness, working in accordance with his name, he has formed a group of women.
Landar, who is a solar powered lantern, has started a church to give light to the light.
He is providing these lanterns at a cost of Rs 100 per month.
People are taking such lights in the evening and giving them electronics in the morning.
I know that about 500 households are providing such electrification benefits till I have heard.
This Noorjahan has been working towards providing electronics to these lanterns throughout the day.
But a good beginning has taken place.
66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana in a very short span of time.
I am happy that 24 lakh of these 66 lakh beneficiaries are women.
I had already said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
Sailesh Bonsley has made it fun of them.
He is doing this by buying a tanker and I know that in a short span of time he has returned the loan of Rs. 2 lakh to the bank.
This is our vision of Mudra Yojana.
The same was stated in the case of Mamta Sharma ji from Bhopal.
He also received 40,000 rupees from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He's working to make a handcuff.
With no need to pay higher interest, about Rs. 1000 per month is left.
There was a good business for his family.
But I want to further expand this scheme.
All our banks must reach it with greater understanding and come forward to help small businessmen.
In fact, they are acting as economic drivers of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to encourage them.
It's good, but it has to be better and better.
This means that the cost of our freedom is to be always awakened by the name of Rashtriya Jagriyaam Bhai, Eternal Vigilance is the piece of freedom.
The country's unity should continue to be shouting.
But I look forward to more suggestions.
I am confident that your above suggestions will certainly be of benefit.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is going to start.
Once again my best wishes to the people of the country, Jai Hind
I have got the opportunity to interact with you all again through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the 5th one-day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
The 5-day cricket competition has been called Gandhi Mandela series.
Therefore, interest in the final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate the friends of the All India Radio at Kannur station.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the companions of Kannur Radio Station.
I once again want to tell you about Kerala today.
Duya Mary Upper Primary School students from Sindhu region of Kerala have sent me a letter.
This letter is special in many ways.
On one hand, these girls were registering their thumbs and covering the return of Bharat Mata in a very big cloth.
The Indian map has been sent to me by Bharat Mata.
I was surprised first why they took their thumb map records and made this film.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I gave it to me how big index they have sent to me.
They are engaged in the awareness movement of organ donation.
Guruji, about 80-year-old resident of Maharashtra, has been conducting a movement for a long time.
He wants to celebrate organ donation as a festival.
Nowadays, many news and information are coming to me through my phone.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent a similar message to me.
I am talking to Devesh from Delhi. I am very happy to note that the government's efforts to donate organs and its policy plans.
The nations like China are in a very advanced position in terms of organ donation and I feel that the goal of a body donation for 10 lakhs of the government is commendable.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, liver and liver organ donations are required every year in the country.
However, in the country of 125 crore people, we can implement only 5,000 organic changes.
It is necessary to brighten one lakh eyes every year.
But we can only give eye to 25,000 people.
When 4 people need eyes, we can only give it to one of us.
Efforts have been made to provide guidance to the State Governments.
Some states have made good progress in simplifying the administrative processes and trying to eradicate it.
I express my gratitude to Tamil Nadu for the first time in donating body parts.
Helpline, which runs for 24 hours, is provided through the number of 1800 11 4770.
Our ancestors are not even honey dynasty.
That is, they have said through the words of Honey Dayakteen Bunjeetha that is, the joy of sacrifice.
In the last few days, Delhi's G.
This operation was successful and a life was saved.
A few days later, we will also celebrate the Deepavali festival.
We also celebrated Eid and Democratic Chaturthi.
The Indian African Convention is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2018.
This is the first time that such a large-scale conference is being held on Indian soil.
54 African countries and Union leaders have been called to participate in the conference.
The population of our two countries is one-third of the world's population.
Millions of years ago, India and Africa have been the only geography and then it is said to be two parts of the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of unity.
India's wildlife and Africa's wildlife can see many appreciations.
There is a great consensus on natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in African countries for years.
There are relations between India and African countries in the fields of economic, cultural and political.
However, India is playing a major role in training the younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India in the field of Human Resource Development and Skill Development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organised a very important event.
Competitions have been organised in writing poems and increasing their participation among all the students attached to the CBSE.
Thousands of schoolchildren wrote information on Indian African connectivity.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the people of the village saw, what was the contribution of Gandhiji in the relationship between Africa and India, and the people of both these lands knew how their impact was on their minds.
Several important contributions were made in this competition.
A poet has a fascinating heart, this is my favorite, so I want to read it to you.
I extend my warm greetings to all the students, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development, who have participated in this event.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and the Parliamentarian Model Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, many members have completed this work.
They are engaged in this.
Last month, a commentatory was held in Bhopal.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the leaders of the villages, district governments, some parliamentarians, and officers from the State Governments, on the Model Gram Yojana.
This led to a number of new ideas that were inspired.
I would like to take care of some things.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, when we talk about Jharkhand, it reminds us of Mao extremists, bombing culture and massacres.
Many parts have been damaged by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
However, our senior parliamentarian, Kariya Munda ji, who has been working as the Vice-Chairman of the Parliament, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, brightened the hearts of the people, tried to live in government organisations and encouraged the officers to work there.
He created a country to bring development in that area, which was long-term neglected.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Village Programme, a successful effort has been made to create awareness in the minds of the people in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to Honble Member of Parliament, Kriya Munda.
Other arrangements are going on and he has created a special innovation in this regard.
He dedicated a work to the students studying in the schools there.
He asked school students studying in upper classes to keep their parents in this category.
In this way, the school was also providing education to students and their parents in the morning and evening.
These children taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
See, how big change has been made in the society without any budget, without any rotating, without any special comfort, through just commitment.
This is the song given to us in the village of Dwarapuri.
This village is known for production of black pepper and black pepper.
Ruwala ji started the banana festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of one thing and after the Deepawali celebrations last year, the media has carried out a movement in our country, especially in our country.
The way we are trying about cleanliness before the festivals, even after the festivals, it is right to continue.
This kind of work should be done during every general event.
Today, I congratulate all the media in India.
On 2nd October, when Gandhijis birth anniversary and Swachh Bharat Mission was launched and one year was completed, it was a privilege to participate in the event of Safai Giri organised by the India Today Committee.
He has been encouraging sanitation works for the last one year through EDV, and there have been reports on his newspapers and he is focusing only on creative work.
He has linked 51 lakh children of about 55 to 56,000 schools from Andhra and Telugu to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Be it public places or railway stations or shrines, hospitals or parks, Swachhta Mission is being organized in many places.
These reports also strengthen the creation of a Swachh Bharat.
The ABP News Cell has launched a programme titled 'India My Country'.
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in the minds of the people about how much awareness about cleanliness has happened among the people.
NDTV was organised to create a Swachh Bharat Mission.
There are several channels and many newspapers in our country and I cannot tell everyone's names because of the lack of time, but everybody took this movement.
For the past several years, this village has been taking cleanliness as a summit and every generation has been doing cleanliness.
A few years ago, the rulers have written in the letter that this village has been awarded the most clean village of Asia.
I am very happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, which is located in the remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for several years.
It has become the culture of the village.
This kind of events give us confidence that our country is certainly clean.
My dear countrymen, when I spoke to the Red Fort from the bottom of August 15, I had said that corruption has gone down in the country.
My best wishes to all my young social friends.
In the last budget, we have made an important announcement.
Accordingly, you can get your gold in the bank and as you get the interest for your investment, you can get the interest of the gold deposited in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you through the bank.
Now tell the people of the country, whether the gold money is fat or not
Can't the gold that has been unprofitablely encapsulated change to life
Don't keep gold in the house waste.
There are two advantages of its safety and circumstance, and do not miss its benefits.
We don't have to buy gold, we don't have to save gold and nobody can play the paper.
I will surely dedicate this project to the people of the country that will provide security in the next week.
However, we have so far used foreign gold currency or are using foreign gold boundaries.
Why shouldn't there be an indicator for our country
Therefore, before the sacred day of Danteras in the coming week, the Indian Golden Money will be released by five villages and 10 Grams of Ashoka Chakra.
Besides, 20 grams of gold boundaries will also be provided to the people.
I am sure this new project will bring about a new change in the path of economic development, in which your full cooperation will be given to me.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, on the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
When Patel, who was a vision of Ek Bharat, Uttam Bharat, thinks about them, the whole of India will be thrilled.
This great man has made a big contribution to India's integration.
Not only these varieties, but the beauty that has given us honour will not fail us.
Therefore, the mantra of unity is the only variety.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last several years, a unity movement has been carried out on October 31.
I have already got the opportunity to participate in it.
I am told that this time too, arrangements are being made in different areas and people are engaged in the preparation of loneliness.
The movement of solidarity is actually a movement towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is to run the solidarity.
Let us pay tributes to Sardar ji.
We will take the mantra of unity forward.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are engaged in the preparation of the Deepavali festival.
I urge my parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali but also to see the color that our children have no effect, and we have to clean it.
My dear countrymen, the next day I will go to Britain.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
When our children go to Britain, I am confident that this memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination for them.
As far as possible, learn and live for the country, this is the message of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, he has not lived.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Basaveswar for democracies and for the empowerment of women has to be understood.
It is an excellent example of the vision of Lord Basaveswar in London, to dedicate the statue of Lord Basaveswar to the people of the world, how many centuries ago, the ideals of the greats of India were immense.
When such an event takes place, the minds of all the people of the country are filled with tune.
I have the colors of your suggestions.
And then with your letters, programmes are being organized at Al India Radio, consultations are being conducted by the government officials and some are trying to find solutions to them when they write about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
It is true that I cannot learn so many languages, even though I have some languages to learn.
In your language, I will definitely try to enter your mind at 8 pm.
Look how close our relationship has emerged.
The last one year was completed
Today we are on foot in the new year.
Once again my best wishes to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all, this is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance for the power of the people in democracy.
There is an idea that is based on my lives, and that is why I have great faith in the power of these people.
But the voice of Mann Ki Baat has educated many things, they have translated into experiences, and all of us are aware of how important the power of the people is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti Makeshan Shakti.
I can say that with the experiences I have in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there is a great power in the thought of our forefathers and there is a great truth.
In this context, I congratulate Al India Radio and they have not seen these suggestions in paper, they have seen them as the expectations of the people.
In terms of administration, information must be above the bottom and guidance must be from top to bottom.
Who would have thought that the voice of Mann Ki Baat would be an instrument of information
But it's the same.
I had said that on 2nd October, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Sometimes there were doors for the country, but shouldn't it be the doors for the speech
I don't have much, buy a little bit.
I am happy to note that in the last one year, the sale of doors has been almost two.
It is difficult to break the subsidies to the common man of the society, the middle class and the middle class.
Yet, they snatched it.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Is this not the expression of the power of the people
The governments should also learn the lessons of the power of the government sectors, even though there is a massive manpower, which is effective, powerful and determined.
Whatever I believed, after the Mann Ki Baat, all of them became my surety.
Therefore, today, with the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I once again wish to bow down to the power of the people.
And even the smallest things that people have told me, they have become theirs for the welfare of the country and they have also added them to it.
What else can be more satisfactory
This time I thought of handling a new approach in Mann Ki Baat.
I urge the people of the country to telephone and register your questions and your advice.
Discussions from all parts of India have come to the extent that there is nothing that doesn't call.
It's a pleasant experience.
All the adults have consulted.
It was easier to listen to some suggestions and my team is paying attention to others.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes, but your advice and news are very important for me.
The government will definitely pay full attention to your suggestions.
It is generally seen that negativeness is full of negative ideas all around
But my experience is different.
Moreover, there were more calls from people with disabilities, especially those with disabilities.
They cannot see televisions, but they must ask radio.
Bhawan Acharya ji from Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want the people of the country to listen to Bhawan Acharya ji's advice and follow it.
My name is Pawan Acharya, I am from Alwar region of Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I urge the people of the country to use abundant soil bright lights.
Moreover, by using soil grasshoppers, the environment is not polluted, and there should be employment for thousands of soil-productive poor.
During the coming festivals, if we listen to Bhawan Acharya's advice then the soil lights will be used in our houses, but I urge the people of the country to put the light in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, during the Democracy, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the three soldiers.
As the 1965 war was over, 50 years ago, an exhibition called Veering Path at India Gate in Delhi was organised.
We have heard about the glorious moments of the war, the blessings and sacrifices of our soldiers, and there are no pictures or pictures of that period.
If you want to build history, you must understand the libraries of history well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness must be ourselves and we should also provide the means of it.
I didn't misunderstand this.
I am very well aware that the Parliament of the country is also engaged in discussions on cleanliness.
On the other hand, what can be a matter of pride for the country that both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness on the other side of the Parliament
The movement of conceptions has created an atmosphere against pollution and awakening on cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once I want to choose one between freedom and cleanliness, I would like to first clean it and then it is the freedom of the country.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhiji.
Kulshan Arora, Delhi, has registered a document on MyGov website.
Deen Dayal Upadhyaya wants to know about his centenary.
Even last year, there may be many types of fashion clothes, but I had asked him to be with the doorsteps.
I urge you to give a place for something.
Last time you have almost doubled the sale.
How many poor have benefitted from this
You have completed the work that the government has not been able to spend several crores of rupees with small help.
This is the strength of the people, so I once again request you in this matter.
My dear countrymen, my mind is also happy for another thing.
I want to share this with you.
I went to Kolkata in May and the family of Subhash Bose had come to meet me.
His brother son Chandra Bose organised the meeting.
Chandra Bose and his family were engaged in this work and it was decided that last week more than 50 families of Subhash Bose will be coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how great it gives me happiness
Many of the family members of Subhash Babu live in other countries.
Is it a matter of great satisfaction that everybody is coming here especially for this
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to take this as a habit.
I want the youth of the country to make efforts to join the voter list and also participate in the vote.
In the election season, I am telling you one thing, first vote, then all others.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Among them, I met a young man who reads the seventh grade of Kashitij Pandey.
He is studying in the seventh grade of Banaras Hindu University at Kendriya Vidyalaya.
Similarly, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The daughter of Sathavraj Patel, 9, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi.
She's a woman from a very poor family.
The whole singing of this girl is singing, but the greatest thing is that when she asked about some sensitivity of Geetha, she dedicated it and gave her English explanation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, she told her that she was telling it from her 5th year.
He further said that this is a great surprise to all of us in the family.
It had a great impact on me in yourself.
Some kids have an interest in popularity, but there is no such impression for the child Sonamu.
I feel that God has given her some special power.
It is a special thing that I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I would like to share this with you.
You must make the voice of your mind once a week because we get more imagination from these.
Sudip ji, don't you know what you want to buy from me
Now it's the best time for a month.
One year has passed since Mann Ki Baat.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used the heaven
He launched a broadcast in Germany and spread his views through radio on free radio for the people living in India.
Asad Hindu Radio was launched by a weekly report.
He broadcast radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Urdu and Pashdu in many languages.
I have also completed a year from the launch of my radio broadcast through Mann Ki Baat.
Your contribution is not worth mentioning to me.
My best wishes to all of you again.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
Once again, I have a good opportunity to inform you of the voice of my mind.
In the southern part of the country, people are celebrating the Oman Festival and yesterday the Raksha Bandhan Festival was celebrated across the country.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security, keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, all of them have joined these projects in detail.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested our sisters to take advantage of these security schemes.
I am told that about 11 crore households are connecting themselves with this scheme in a short span of time.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are as mothers and sisters.
I consider this as a good sign.
My best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, people started implementing their schemes in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised that a scheme that cannot be completed in 60 years can be implemented within such a short time.
However, it is heartening to note that all the sectors connected to the implementation of this project, all the branches of the banks have been engaged with full force and mind, and we have succeeded in this thing, so far, about 17.
Even though it is said that even the revered accounts can be started, they have saved Rs. 22,000 crore in it.
The banking sector is also one of the main components of the economy, which has reached the houses of the poor.
Today, 1.
25 lakh bank companions are working on the ground.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Now thousands of people have become empowered to take overdraft due to their scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again, I would like to congratulate and congratulate all those associated with it and I would like to appeal to all the poor not to break your relationship with the banks at all times.
Banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have taken the banks to the doorsteps of your houses, do not leave it and hold it thickly.
We all have to have money in bank accounts.
I don't believe that you will definitely do this.
Just a few days ago, the events in Gujarat, violence, violence and all over the country, have lost peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of demand has happened on the land of Gandhi and Sardar. It is a matter of great sorrow and pain for all the people of the country.
Peace, integrity and brotherhood is the right path
On the path of progress, we all have to travel by standing shoulder to shoulder.
Progress can only be a solution to all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud to be participating in this event that will be attended by Buddhists from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to share the voice of my mind with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters, don't want me to die and don't be afraid.
I assure you that if someone is trying to guide you in a wrong way, we will not take any action to replace you.
For us, there is a value for every citizen of the country, but there is a special significance for the opinions and voices of the farmers.
We brought an emergency law.
The deadline of the Emergency Act will be concluded on 31st August.
This will ensure that farmers are not economically damaged.
I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not merely words of fury.
The interests of the poor farmers living in villages are in our minds.
Therefore, in my Independence Day address, I had said that the Ministry should work in the field of agriculture and farmers welfare, not just in the field of agriculture.
We are taking this resolution faster.
I want to talk about one more thing.
Two days ago, the war was completed in 1965 and 50 years were completed.
When we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also be remembered.
Our scientists are really making excellent progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
It was a sympathetic and academic to me.
Many young scientists shared things with me very fast and I had a lot of dreams in their eyes.
Even in the last Mann Ki Baat, I had asked you to guide our students' wealth to science.
I had also spoken on the occasion of my Independence Day.
Every poor family and widowed mothers have to gain a letter of securities and seek help from whom to get jobs while calling for a direct election.
This is one of the reasons for corruption at the bottom.
I had said that there should be no direct selection under a specific condition.
I am glad that the government is progressing rapidly in this direction, suggestions are being made, this resolution will be completed almost and it will be tired as a direct selection for the bottom-level workplaces.
Today, there are colors of international entrepreneurs in India.
In order to reduce the maternal-child mortality rate, 24 countries of the world have coordinated a conference in India to implement the Call to Action Plans.
The first meeting was held in India outside the US.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh babies in our country die and then die.
Just as we are freed from polio, we are also freed from detention, as a reason for mother-child deaths.
The world has accepted this.
But even today, we must save our mothers and save our brethren.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue fever is spreading.
It is true that the fever of dengue is dangerous, but it is easier to prevent it.
My request for Swachh Bharat is related to it.
Even if we see advertisings on television, we don't pay attention to them.
Even though advertisements are made in newspapers, our child is not paid in it.
Awareness is being made in small matters in the households and in the way of clean water conservation
However, we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities, but sometimes we don't know about the accumulation of water around us.
I urge you not to expand such a simplicity to die.
Life is very valuable.
The lack of attention for water conservation and cleanliness neglect are the calls to die, it is not right.
Around 514 dengue fever testing centres have been set up across the country, where free tests have been conducted.
Timely check-up and treatment is the best for life saving.
In this matter, your cooperation is very important.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, festivals and festivals will be filled in our country in the coming days.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good registrations will become habitual, willn't it
My dear countrymen, I want to share a happy message with you.
Hidendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of the tribal people of our country are enhanced in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
These two brothers are proud of India.
This year, these two brothers have succeeded in this event and have been proud of India.
I extend my best wishes and appreciation to these two brothers.
But in all these endeavours, they are keeping in mind the interests of Time ia, Vision for Tribals.
See how everybody is contributing to the progress of the country.
When this kind of events are heard, there is a glory in the heart.
Sometimes, because of our perspective, we have suffered injustice to our youth.
An idea that the new generation doesn't know anything, I believe that this trend has been going on for centuries.
But my experience is different from the youth.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can learn many things too.
I have met many youngsters who have decided to ride on Sundays on the Sundays.
Some people are following it as a cycle day that I will travel on a cycle one day a week.
They say that this gives me the benefits of health and environment and the happiness of the youth.
Cycle clubs are being run in many cities of our country and many are also inspiring the journey of the cycle.
This is a good effort for health and environmental health.
Like the achievements of both the youth of India have made the country proud, the vision of the youth of the country is also worth mentioning.
The building of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial on the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been in a long time.
When Indians around the world visit London, the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, which will be set up by the Maharashtra Government, will be conceived.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations and appreciations to the State Government of Maharashtra for trying to build these two memorials to be built to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you, thank you very much.
There is a lot of deficiency of pulses and oil seeds in our country.
The poor need pulses, and some thoughts are required to be added to broader varieties.
I am very happy to note that in this process, there is a 50 increase in pulses species and about 33 increase in oil cultivation.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers on this matter.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, it has been celebrated as a day of success in the Kargil war in the history of our country.
Not only did the war take place on the borders of Kargil, but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it important for another matter.
After the formation of our government in 2014, we started the MyGov website on 26th July in a few months.
I am glad that about 2 crore people have gone to MyGov web site after nearly one year of the government has completed and about 5.
It is even more happy that more than 50,000 people have given their suggestions in the PMO app and have spent their golden time for this and have paid their child in it.
They have given a very excellent suggestion.
But the people of the government have not been able to take care of this thing yet, but brother Allash Vajpayee ji's advice was taken by the government and today we have been implementing it.
Today, any of the government's programmes are being implemented, projects are being implemented, policies are being formulated and there are very positive suggestions on MyGov website.
Now on August 15, I have also been consulting MyGov on what I should talk about.
Suchitra Rajavachary from Chennai has given me many suggestions.
He has been asking all the women to save their children, teach their children, talk about Swachh Ganga and Swachh Bharat.
This is an idea in my mind and this time, on August 15, you will not be able to register your ideas about what I should talk about.
You can send to MyGov Movement, write to the radio, send to the Prime Minister's Office.
In my speech on August 15, there is a great idea that I should get the place from the public.
Surely, I think you will give me the best ideas.
Two days ago, my thoughts were on an accident in Delhi and after that, the life of the person who traveled in the square was split for ten minutes.
He has no help.
Sometimes people are asking me to talk about road safety and to create awareness.
Your concerns are all right.
If we wash the statistics, the heart will stand.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
I urge my parents to create an environment regarding a child-driven vehicle, 2 cycle vehicle or 4 cycle vehicle, whatever the administration has to do with the obligations to do.
In this regard, the government has also made several initiatives in this regard, be it road safety awareness, road construction engineering, enforcement, emergency treatment for the injured after the accident, we are taking the Road Transport and Defence Bill in mind.
In the coming days, we are planning to take several important initiatives in implementing the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We are focusing on cashless treatment on national highways like Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
Under this, we are thinking about how to get the best life-saving measures and maintenance in the first 50 hours, avoiding the issues related to which money is not available.
We must first reach this, in fact, the price of every life is valued.
I have been saying sometimes that the worker should be a Karma Yogi.
In the last few days, I will share with you some events that touched my mind.
It is a good feeling to see how everybody can bring life even in their works.
Vijay Biswal has shown how he can connect his country, his art and his strength with his work.
I believe that Vijay Piswal's painting can be a thing to speak in the coming days.
I am keen to have a programme undertaken by a large group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
Sometimes, some small things are also very happy and that's why I share them with you.
There is a village named Keshla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh
Over the past few months, they have created a movement to build toilets.
Now there is no need to spend natural patterns outside the village.
Whatever this happens, when it is completed, the entire village celebrated it as a big festival.
The best examples of how the values of social life are changing, how the vision of the people is changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
Bhavesh Da from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-East.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a Ministry called DONER was set up which means the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern states.
Well, we can't decide the interests of the North-Eastern states in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officers of the Government of India visited the North-Eastern region including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This effort can have better results in the coming days.
This is an extraordinary effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas, which I call ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am extremely happy to see the success of the Sewaii Satellite Travel Scheme.
A few days ago, India has launched 5 UK satellites through its PSLV C28.
Even though this news is not one of the most attractive, this is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the young people of the country, what you want after the development, they replied that a hundred of them want me to be a scientist.
It is a matter of concern that there is a lack of country on science.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Movement on this occasion.
I urge the officials of the Government of India to share your experiences with them, in order to encourage students from school and colleges near you one or two hours a week.
Our villages should get electricity for 24 hours or not
This work is difficult, but it must be completed.
Today, even if you want to serving mobile, you have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should be expanded to the villages and these facilities for the poorest of the market.
In this context, we have launched the 'Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti' scheme.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages and to ensure electricity supply to remote areas.
Your ideas will be mad for me.
Thank you very much
When I said so, there is no hope that you will get a lot of answers.
Millions of people sent photographs through towers, Facebook and Instagram.
I have also retweeted some of them that attracted my views.
If some people say that the photographs of Andhra Pradesh (B) mobile caves have not been registered, many people of the country would have been unaware of such caves.
Photographing of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh is the same
We always know Rajasthan as a less water state, but it is very surprising when one from there sends photographs of waterfalls on Mayan.
That is, actually, a wonderful thing happened.
I can assure you that Yoga exercises are not sunset in the world.
What kind of red composition is the world extending Yoga and no Indian has the honour and pride in his mind
I was also in the flood of joy and the mind was blooming.
As the Sin River and the Eiffel Tower of the people of France are very proud, they also chose the posterior place to practice yoga.
The New York people knew the Times square for Yoga.
While talking about Australia's Sydney, the scenes of Abera House are shining in mind immediately.
The people of Australia had practiced yoga before the Abera House Symptom.
Rajpath is Yogapat.
I felt a new upheaval, a new feeling, a new interest and a new zeal in all the crores of the world.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had dwelled in the photograph of Yoga, which was very interesting and popular throughout the world.
In doing yoga, all are connected to women, men, old people, children, villagers, cities, developing countries and developing countries.
Yoga is actually a factor in connecting the world.
I don't know how the wisdom of the living creatures shall despise and criticize this event.
But it is a matter of pride for every Indian that the world is very interested in knowing about India.
There is an interest in India and the world wants to know about Indias values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the pride and pride of our heritage, then we can make it better for the world.
Sometimes we think of what is innovation in this, for example, we can tell our family values and we do not know that India's family values are the biggest thing for the world.
This is the request of the youth of the country, especially the youth in the field of Information Technology, to all of you, to launch an online yoga programme.
Do you know that there is a sector named AYUSH in the government
Nobody's attention will return to it.
There are two to four times in five years, a small sector from one corner.
But it was during Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has shown the world's largest work.
This is an example of how many small organisations can be fulfilled when the goal is in front of us.
The world was surprised to see how our people had rescued those who were trapped in the country of Eman.
Within a few hours, the world saw that Indians had rushed to Nepal and helped them.
If we start working in our minds, the government will also work quickly, the government workers will also work quickly and the common man will be observed by lifting up their heads.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power to advance the country.
Last month, three people from Kolkata had announced life insurance schemes.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaged in life insurance schemes, but we have to take it forward.
I want to put it before you.
The Raksha Bandhan Festival is coming in August, the people of the country will not start a strong mass movement before the Raksha Bandhan Festival. Can these people give the benefits of life insurance to our mothers and sisters
Come, let us all join me and try to fulfill this commitment.
When I sound the voice of Mann Ki Baat, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have advised me to tell me something about the monsoon.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Tandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyanshu Gupta are asking you to talk about the weather.
They have given good ideas to their share.
You might have also enjoyed eating hot bakodas, bajjis and solar with sowing tea during this rainy season.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Each drop of rain is valued.
As a citizen and as a society, we must continue to enhance the feeling of protecting every drop of water.
The water in the village should be used in the same way for the use of the city.
We have to protect every drop of water, be it water management, be it small ponds or lakes.
If you have to go to the birthplace of Gandhiji, if you can see his house then you can see that there is a touch on the surface of the water conserved under his 200-year-old house in which rain water has been provided directly.
You must see this.
Even at that time, this kind of care has been taken.
We can't do this too
This must be transformed into a mass movement.
The village should be followed this time.
Similarly, the greenery takes our eyes.
How charming is the green life
All these trees, plantations and gardens change their lives to a greenery, right
We all have to implement tree plantation and movement in this rainy season through social organisations and through youth.
I offer a suggestion from my own experience and this rural technology is very successful.
When you meditate, put an old mud near the plant, fill it with water.
The health is very important because of the moisture filled in the environment, the micro-organisms grow in bulbs.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink clean water.
Most of the people boil the water in this season.
It's a lot of money.
The more we take care of, the more you get protection from diseases.
There is a need for water and rain, but it is also important to be safe from diseases.
Ladies and gentlemen, now we have introduced three new projects, especially for the urban people.
Under the Amrid Yojana, we have launched a movement to facilitate living of our cities.
In 2022, when India celebrates the 75th anniversary of its independence, all Indians should be provided a house.
Considering these three things, we have started a big project.
This inspired all parents to take selfie photographs with their daughters and register on social websites.
In Haryana, the rate of female children is very low as compared to men and girls.
There are 100 districts of this kind of worrying ratio in the country.
This is the highest in the state of Haryana.
In some way, let us make a programme of 'Beti Safety and Reading' as a mass movement.
Behold, you will feel how happy the glory, pride and the glory of the daughters and the safety of the daughters will be the movement.
Remember the rainy season very well
Make our country green
I am saying this experiencedly.
Take this forward.
The next time I will meet you for the next Mann Ki Baat event.
Sometimes some people believe that I want to announce the welfare of the government at my Mann Ki Baat programme.
This is my pleasure.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this interim period has passed.
And it shall come to pass on Sunday, when the last Sunday of the month is 11 o'clock in the morning, that, behold, there is a feeling that something has gone away, and that it is yourselves.
But what happened when I thought that it should be on Sunday.
But I looked forward to this Sunday when it came.
Many people have asked me why I traveled to Kedarnath in the midst of the election process.
But if I have started traveling in that direction, the voice of Mann Ki Baat can change.
That's why I was stagnant when the election period was overwhelmed and the imaginations of the failure and the voting continued.
Many consider it a political instrument.
In terms of me, I consider it a chance to meet me.
In a way, I went to meet myself.
I can't say when I will do it, but I will definitely do it because it is my obligation to explain your rights.
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have been consistently recognising your efforts to strengthen positive things.
Installations in the letters to Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the leaflet.
Sometimes your words are also opening the umbrella in the midst of my thoughts.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his desire against cleanliness, while collaborating with the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone discusses the environment, his pain is reflected in it
But at the same time, he also explains his efforts, and he describes his thoughts in his mind.
That is, in a way, an exhibition on how the solution to the problems can be incorporated to the entire society will be illuminated in his words.
Mann Ki Baat works as a glass for the country and society.
This shows that there is no dearth of strength, strength and capability in the depths of the people of the country.
It is the need to integrate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and join in constructive efforts.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people of the country want to join the country in a strong and constructive manner.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but you can imagine that he has not made any application for himself...
..the feelings of such millions of people in the country will be so excellent
When I examine all these things, I leave your imagination of how happy I am, how much enthusiasm I am.
You cannot imagine that you're driving me, you're running me quickly, you're hiding yourself in me every moment...
I was waiting for David without this relationship.
Today my mind is filled with satisfaction.
Come on, let us move ahead with the sound of Mann Ki Baat in this spirit.
At the time of emergency in the country, the struggles against it have not stopped with political definitions or political leaders
It has not been imprisoned in the midst of prison camps.
Every individual was angry.
There was a phenomenon for the distant democracy.
If we don't eat food every day, we don't know what is hungry.
Likewise, whenever one comes to know about the rights of democracy and the joy given by him in a routine life, only when one takes our democratic rights.
And it came to pass, when the emergency was born, that, behold, every inhabitant from all the land was broken by him.
I am very proud to say that India is a living society because of this tradition.
That is why the people of the country understood the lack of democracy and during the emergency we felt this lack.
Therefore, the country dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy, but for the entire election.
When something or something is far away from our handicraft, we imagine its significance less and we ignore its miracles.
In India, more than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
This number may seem to be most ordinary to us, but if we have seen China from the viewpoint of the world, more people have voted in this election than the population of any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is twice as far as the total population of the United States is higher than the entire European population.
This indicates the vastness and broadness of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections in 2019 have so far been the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine how much goods and human resource will be required to manage such a massive election.
This is possible as a result of the hard work of millions of teachers, officers and workers overnight.
This time, because of their hard work, more than the last time, the vote has been staged.
In order to vote, about 10 lakh votes across the country, more than 40 lakh voter machines and more than 17 lakh virtual instruments...
I leave your immense imagination of the arrangements.
All these were implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a far-flung area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one voter was formed for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers took two days to reach there.
This is the true respect given to democracy.
The ballot in the world's highest place is in India.
This ballot is at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahaul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, this election has a more pride.
This may be the first time in history that women and women have enthusiastically participated in the vote for men.
In this election, the vote percentage of women and men was almost similar.
Another interesting thing about this is that today, the number of women members is 78 in order to achieve them.
My dear countrymen, you must have asked me several times that it is not a book.
I had been asking you to give books instead of flowers on the occasions such as welcome and honour.
Since then, people have started giving books at several places.
Now a person has given me a book titled 'Premchand ji's famous stories and I like this.
It has not been time for many days, but due to his foreign visit, he has got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
Premchand has described the reality of the society in his stories and the scenes start immersing in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
The second edition touched the depths of my mind and its name was Eidkah.
To understand with the blessings of a young man, a clean love from his grandchildren, and his glorious heart in such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes to his grandchildren from the festival of Hamid, he is actually touching the height.
Likewise, 'Bhus Ki Rath' is the name of a person who touches his chest.
In this story, a contradiction found in the lives of a poor farmer is portrayed with life.
Even after his consequences have been damaged, why is Haldu a farmer happy, he does not need to sleep in his field in the winter of bone-building.
But even though these stories were written about a century ago, we can feel that these are still suitable.
After reading these, I felt a unique experience.
While talking about reading, I was reading in some media about Akshara Library in Kerala.
Sometimes, the books have been tied to the bottom of the bottom and have been tied to the back.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to the tribal children but also to everyone.
Gujarat Mission through Gujarat is a successful effort.
In this movement of reading books, all age groups participated in lakhs.
Today, in the digital world, I urge you to spend some time in the middle of your daily customs.
Indeed, you will be very happy and write about the book you have read and the Narendra Modi App, so that the voice leaders of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to know that our countrymen are thinking about things that can become challenges in the future, not stopping with the present.
When I read your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I could see that many people wrote about water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai from Belgavi and Siddamsu Mohan Parita from Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has great importance in our culture.
In the book of Request, it is said: Abohista Maobua: Stan Kaurje Dadhana, Maharenaya Sakshashe, Yova: Siddhamoras: Dusseh Bajayadehna, Ushtriva Madhar: Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, it feels that water is the power and power to live.
You are equal to mother, mother is good for her blessings, let your blessings lie on us.
Water conservation affects many parts of the country every year.
You might be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available due to rain throughout the year can be saved in our country.
Just 8 percent.
That's why the time has come for a solution to this problem.
I am sure that in collaboration with the peoples participation like other issues, through the power of the people, through the opening of 130 crore people, this crisis can be resolved with stress.
In view of the importance of water, a new Ministry of Water Resources has been set up in the country.
This will help in taking decisions on all water related matters in a rapid manner.
A few days ago, I had to make some things different.
I had a letter to the Panchayat leaders of the country and the villagers.
And I wrote a letter to them, saying, To save water, to gather water, to keep every drop of rain water, that they might gather together the church of the village, and to join with the villagers, and to take counsel.
I am happy that they have been engaged in this work and on 22nd this month, millions of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
And all the people of the village were determined to save every drop of water, and shared their lives.
Today, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to you about the leader of a partnership.
The people there have once again become ready to fulfil their positive contribution to water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the villagers who have worked positively from my side.
There are many leaders who have taken the challenge of water conservation across the country.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
I have a feeling that the villagers are now engaged in the competition to raise a temple for some water in their village.
As I said, there are positive results through social efforts.
There is no way to face water constraints across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country and in different ways.
But the goal of all is to save water and to maintain water.
Punjab's waste water canals are being damaged.
This effort will liberate from the problem of hindrance.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to the drainage of water in Timeyapalli, Telangana.
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
When I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 2,000 women mobilized in the work of revival of Naga river.
At the same time, I also read about the women of Garhwal area and they have done a very good job of collecting rain water.
The water will be stored when people open one.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I offer three appeals to the people of the country.
My first request is that as the people of the country have transformed cleanliness into a mass movement, let us take the beginning of making water conservation a mass movement.
Together, we will conserve every drop of water, and I believe that you are a miraculous smelling rope by the Lord.
It is said that this rosemary is iron gold.
But you are also such a rosemary that new life is produced by the pressure of water.
We have to make every drop of water a conserved awareness movement.
My second application to the countrymen, behold, many traditional methods of water conservation have been used in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods with you.
If someone of you gets the opportunity to go to the place of birth in the battlefield, then there is a 200-year-old water conservation in a house behind the house.
Come, let us create a lot of lists of water conservation and encourage people to join the water conservation.
You all share your views using this JanSakti4JalSakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you and the people of the world for something else.
Many of the Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known and common citizens of the world showed me how Yoga is being organized in every country through Twitter.
On that day, the world appeared as a happy family.
We know the need for a healthy society, a healthy and understanding person, and it ensures Yoga.
Therefore, the extension of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Didn't you have to be proud to recognise such a service
In the year 2019, the announcement of the Prime Minister's Awards has given me an unprecedented way to contribute to the progress and development of Yoga.
This award is given to organisations that have played an important role in spreading Yoga across the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan is organising a number of institutions and training studies there
Similarly, Ms.
He is an example of not conception.
When you come to know about Yoga, tell us that India is behind.
This is a special day for Yoga to be celebrated widely and to be honoured by all those who take the message of Yoga to all households.
My heart, my dear countrymen, this journey has started today, new feelings, new commitments and new openness...
Yeah, always wait for your suggestions and reports.
We all meet and enjoy interacting.
I hear your sentiments, I awake, I understand.
Sometimes I try to live according to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You are my concepts, you will give me strength.
Come, let us join us and experience the voice of Mann Ki Baat, let us fulfill our obligations in life on Tuesday.
Once again we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My mind is dreaming today when the voice of Mann Ki Baat begins.
10 days ago, Bharat Mata has lost her brave friends.
These mighty soldiers, 125 crore Indians have lost their lives to protect us.
Our brave friends had dedicated themselves to the people of the country to sleep peacefully.
The minds of the country have been wounded and shouted in anger after the martyrdom of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's terrorist attack.
There are condolences from all sides about the martyrs and their families.
I salute all the soldiers of the country who have sacrificed their lives to protect the mother of India.
The task of tackling this challenge in front of the country must be forgotten by all the concepts such as racism, religion and regionalism, and that is why our drives and decisions against terrorism will be steadfast and strong.
Our armed forces have always shown untouchable courage and might.
On the one hand, they reflect their best capabilities while reacting in the same language to the attackers.
You can see how the operations were carried out within 100 hours of the attack.
The army has committed the commitment of the extremists and their sub-servients to the neighbours.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas that their relatives have been inspired by the media have been widespread and strengthened and strengthened all over the country.
Meena, wife of Prasanna Sahu, a martyr from Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, celebrates her unlimited courage all over the country.
He acknowledged that he would join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena's geography reached Kumla in Jharkhand, his back son and I will work together in the military.
Today, the phenomenon of this bunch is going on increasing the feeling of mixing in the body of every child of India, within the insects and within the lives.
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the martyrs of Kangra, the fathers of Tilakraj, or the six-year-old sons of Hemraj, of Koda, the story of every family of the martyrs is inspiring and inspiring.
I urge the youth to know, understand and understand the feelings that these families have shown, the goals that they show.
It is not necessary for us to see the ancient times of history to know what is the patriotic meaning of sacrifice.
My countrymen above my creatures...
For such a long time, when we all waited for a war memorial, the waiting time is over.
It is natural to have the glory and enthusiasm of the people of the country in this regard.
He was happy to note that Shri Ongar Shetty, a resident of the State of Karnataka, had built a National War Memorial at the Narendra Modi App.
I am surprised that no national level war memorial has been built in our country so far.
I would like to be a memorial decorated with the prophets of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the country.
I assure you that such a memorial must be built in the country.
The second cycle, the cycle of bravery, shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
The walls of this museum will be decorated with the brave acts of the soldiers.
Subsequently, the sacrifice cycle
This cycle demonstrates the sacrifices of soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who have made the nation a supreme sacrifice will be engraved in gold.
Thereafter, the Rakshak Chakra reflects security.
This cycle has a sequence of dense trees.
It is impossible for our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces to play an important role in the progress of the country.
In October last year, I got a big deal to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also built in the light of the feeling that we should be grateful to the men and women in our police forces engaged in security all the time.
I am confident that you will definitely go to the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, you must share the photographs that you have taken on the social website so that others will be inspired to go to these sacred places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments have come to me on different ways for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
This time, when I was reading your views, a interesting idea of Aadish Mukobhathya ji attracted my attention.
His age is only 25 when British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on March 3, Jamsetji Tata ji's birth anniversary is also an accident.
He added that despite these two men belong to the entirely different family backgrounds, both of them have fulfilled the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, offering tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Dada is equivalent to the honourable history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men have brightened not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
If an inspirational man is required today for the guidance of our youth, he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British captured him while he was asleep as a terrible and joyous man.
Do you know why they have forsaken such a thing
Because the British who established such a great empire were also horrible to see him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda drowned the British regime using guns in his traditional wings.
In fact, if people get a presumptionary leadership, the attitude of the society is greater than the power of arms.
The deprived and the oppressed were brought to the sun from dark life.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda was sacrificed at the end of his 25-year life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Mother India have emerged from all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled everywhere because they couldn't be seen anywhere in India as a part of the centuries-long freedom struggle.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, warmth and sacrifice do not reach new generations.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda feel our presence then people like Jamshedji Dada gave great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamsetji Dada ji was a visionary prophet and he had not only seen the future of India but also established a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that it is the need for the future to make India a testimony to science, technology and industry.
It is because of his vision that the Tata Institute of Science was established and now it is known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established a number of trustworthy institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
This interaction led to the birth of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bai Bharti, on 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
Accordingly, Morarji Bai, a peaceful man, is one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
Morarji Bai Desai, who dedicated the most budgetary statement in the Parliament of India of Independence, will serve them.
During that period, the country's democratic system was a major threat to India, when Morarjibai was very difficult.
Morarji Bai Patriotism had dedicated himself against the emergency to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his physics.
The government then arrested him and imprisoned him.
But he became the Prime Minister of the country when the Janata Party succeeded in 1977.
It was during his reign that the 44th constitutional amendment was passed.
What is important is that the 42nd Constitution Amendment was introduced to create an emergency, in addition to reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other conspiracies that were present in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were regained.
That is, the 44th Constitution Amendment enacted the functioning of Parliament and Legislatures to empower printing in newspapers.
In line with the recommendations made by the Cabinet in writing, it was the first time that the President could proclaim the emergency and could not increase the time of emergency for more than six months once.
By declaring the emergency, Morarji Bai promised to prevent the democracies from being killed and buried in 1975.
His contribution to preserve the glory of Indian democracy is very important and now generations will remember it forever.
I once again pay my tributes to such a great leader.
With the help of their hard work, they make positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
They are the real comrades who do the service of the country unhealthyly, the service of the people and the social service.
When Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen who are the people who are the awardees.
In a way, I consider this as a big success because they are not found in the television and paper cards, which are far away from the world.
But if they are so, there is no concern that they should be named, they believe in working on the ground.

Jamuna Tudu, a well-known woman named Lady Tarzan of Jharkhand, has worked as a dare to oppose the slaughter and males, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares of forest and inspired ten thousand women to conserve trees and wildlife.

The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Bihar's Muzaffarpur, is very conscious.
I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, About 12 lakh poor families have been benefitted from this scheme for the last five months.
I can see how many changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My countrymen in my mind are going to start exams in schools.
Various academic boards across the country will start selecting boards for ten or twelve classes in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are selecting.
A few days ago, a big event was held at the Town Hall in Delhi, where the Pariksha Bay Church, i. e.
One of the special features of the session on examinations is that there are discussions on various issues related to the selection without any restriction.

Their self-confidence was really inspiring and inspiring.
While addressing the gathering, an eye-catched young man said that he was a platformist and when he introduced himself as a microscopic person, I asked who would speak as you were.
He said I will speak like a Prime Minister.
At the same time, when I would do something, I was waiting for a joyful thing, just as I would speak in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, he spoke and showed the voice of Mann Ki Baat through Mimikri.
I am glad to know that not only people listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat but also recall it on several occasions.
Indeed, I was very surprised to see the strength of this disabled youth and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, I have been excited to join you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am interacting with millions of families every month through radio.
I believe that whenever you talk to you several times, whenever you read your letters, whenever you ask your phone calls, you consider me as a member of your family.
This feeling blossoms a pleasant experience in my mind.

Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami is going to lay the foundation of this philosophy.
In his 111-year-old life, he served thousands of people for social, education and economic development.
If his patriotism was widespread, he had immense distinction in languages English, Christianity and Kannada.
He is a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in food, sheltering, education and spiritual wisdom.
It was the main objective of Swamiji's life that all kinds of interests should be provided to the farmers.
The Chittorganga monastery is regularly organising Green and Farmers Festivals.
I have received the blessings of Swami ji who has been bowed down.
Our former President Dr. A.
On this occasion, Kalam Iyya read a poem written for the salute Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Ayya demonstrates the lives of Shri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji and the goal of Chittaganga Math in a beautiful manner.
There is an important institution in our country
This is a part of our democracy and a part of our democracy - I talk about the Election Commission of India.
On January 25, we celebrate the Foundation Day of the Election Commission as National Voter Day.
In view of the level of elections being held in India, the world is surprisingly putting finger on the nose
Voting centres are being set up in the areas at a height of 15,000 feet in the State of Himachal Pradesh and also in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the Kir forest area, a vote has been made only for one voter at a far-flung place.
Imagine, my friends...
This is the beauty of our democracy that the entire group of election commissioners go to far-flung areas to get the opportunity to use the voter's voter's vote.
I heartily appreciate the Election Commission, which is constantly making efforts to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment all the Election Commissions of all the States, all the defence forces, independent and unilateral personnel in the election work.
This year Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in our country
Young people born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to burden the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to be partners in the process of making resolutions for the country.
The moment our dreams are connected to the dreams of the country, the Prime Minister said.
If you are eligible to vote, I urge you to register your name in the voter list.
If we cannot vote in life, we must feel that it is sorry.
We have to be sorry to say that there was a mistake in the country.
We must change this process naturally.
I urge all of us to retaliate together, vote on the day of voting, this time, I urge the people of the country to create awareness by conducting a movement.
I firmly believe that the younger generations will register their names in large numbers, good their contributions for our democracy and strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, many times the greatness has emerged on this great land of India, such greats have done some unforgettable and unforgettable acts for humanity.
On 23rd January, he celebrated his birthday in a new way.
On the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the well-known soldiers who have participated in the freedom struggle.
Inside the Red Fort, many such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The Red Fort Rooms have been transformed into a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yat-e-Jallian
The museum built in the memory of India's First Freedom War of 1857 is dedicated to the entire campus as the Grand Mandir, the Revolutionary Mandir.
Every brick kiln in these museums smells the fragrance of our glorious history.
At this place, the British government prosecuted India's brave friends - Colonel Bream Cycle, Colonel Kurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
In the Red Fort Revolutionary Temple, when I kept in mind the memories related to Netaji, one of the family members of Netaji gave me a very important trophy.
Indeed, there is a need to repeat the bravery and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations in different dimensions.
About a month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I got the opportunity to fly the flag at the place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose flag was hoisted 75 years ago.
In this context, the announcement of the State Government of Azad Hind was made 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a talented executive.
Such brave soldiers have played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Delhi, Salo, let me inspire you, and I give you freedom, and Netaji will be able to remove the minds of every Indian from waking up and encouraging anger.
For many years, there was a demand for bringing out the secrets of him to the public.
I am extremely happy that we are doing this work.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji had come to my house one day.
We have jointly spoken about several issues related to Netaji and we have made our sermons to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to improve many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
May it be 26 Alipur roads related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum, be the Grand Mantra.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My countrymen, when we are discussing Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose today, I would like to share with you an event related to Netaji's life in Mann Ki Baat.
I have always thought of radio as an important media to connect with the people.
This radio station has told me that once a week, it has been broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In the administration of this radio station, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is very significant.
The broadcasting of Azad Hind Radio was very popular among the common people and its events gave a lot of strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts have been made to demonstrate Indian art and culture in a more attractive manner.
There are 4 historical exhibitions in the museum, with more than 450 paintings and art works of 3 centuries old.
In the museum, great artists like Amruta Sherg, Raja Ravi Varma, Abindranath Tagore, Gaknendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee have been exhibited very beautifully.
I urge all of you, especially you people, to see the creations of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You can imagine that this is what you are talking about art, but you can go here and talk about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a artist and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painting.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his majority creation.
He observed that whoever sees the picture should understand it, and see the message given by that picture in his eyes.
His paintings are depicted in European countries, Russia and all in the US.
I am confident that you will go to the Grand Mantra and see his paintings.
My destitute countrymen, India is a land full of sacred people.
Our pilgrimage has given the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Such a sacred person is Chand Ravidas.
On February 19, Ravidas ji's birth anniversary.
In fact, if the Lord dwells in all human beings, it is not right to divide him into caste, religion and sections.
Guru Ravidas lived on the holy land of Varanasi.
Pilgrim Ravidas, through his messages, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire life.
It would not be surprising if he said that he had brought the truth of the importance of labour to the world.
I once again remember the holy Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar ji in MyGov has been asking the Indian Space Department to talk to Mann Ki Baat about its future dimensions.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed significantly to Indias space programme.
Our space programme consists of innumerable young scientists of the country.
Our heart is shocking that the satellites and soundingrockets developed by our students are carrying out the space.
On January 24, the Kalamsad application was designed by our students.
In Odisha, sounding rockets made by university students have also commended.
These space missions have been carried out in the last four and a half years since independence and 2014.
We have achieved 104 satellites in a single space space.
We will soon register Indias presence in the moon through Chandrayaan-2 movement.
Our country is using space technologies in a very special way to protect livestock.
Be it wounds, rail and road safety, space technology is providing substantial assistance to all of them.
NAVIC instruments have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protect them and help economic development.
We are excellently fulfilling the service delivery and responsibility of the government using space technology.
Under the scheme of Housing for All, about 40 lakh households have been provided in 23 states.
At the same time, about three and a half crore wealth under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Programme has been geo-tacked.
Today, our satellites are the symbols of the growing energy of the country.
It is because of its contribution that we have made special relations with many countries of the world.
The South Asia Satellite is a special effort that gives a lot of value for development to our neighbouring allies.
Through its special competitive exchange services, India is not only on the basis of growing countries but also on the satellites of developing countries.
The heaven and the earth have always been attractive to the children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to take forward the boundaries that we have seen that we must think bigger and that we cannot do anything yet.
Our children are attracted by the children and inspire them to look for new stars and showcase the vision.
My dear countrymen, those who play, they grow and grow, I always say that this time the sportspersons in Kelo India have brightened.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sportspersons in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
It is only when the sportsperson acts well at the local level that he can understand the most important activity of the world.
This time, sportspersons from all the States in Khelo India showed their capabilities specially.
He lives in a car with his family.
Likewise, Captain Sonali Helvi of Maharashtra's committee for 21-year-old women resides in Sadar.
He has lost his father at a young age, his brothers and his mother have trusted Sonali and encouraged him.
Perhaps we have seen that women are not encouraged more in sports like sports.
But after all, Sonali chose the stairs and worked well.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old Associate, is proud of winning Gold at the youngest sports in Kelo India.
Akshada Vaswani Kamdi, the daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won a gold medal in the bulky category.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But did you hear about the competition to brighten the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets were participating in this spectacular event for nearly a month.
The name of this strange competition is a clean beautiful toilet.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, beauty and reflecting some paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kathch to Kamrup, a large number of pictures related to clean beautiful toilets are available on social websites.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and the villagers to take the lead in such a movement in your Panchayat.
Make sure to share the pictures of your clean beautiful toilets with MyIzzatGhar on the social website.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the country and getting rid of open defecation, we have taken a memorable journey on October 2, 2014.
Due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, before 2nd October, 2019, we are moving towards the direction of getting rid of open defecation, so that we can dedicate to him on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorial journey of Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat bearers is also immense. For this reason, I am happy to share this thing with you that more than five and a half lakh villages and 600 districts have been freed from open defecation and 98 percent of the households of rural India have been provided to about 9 crore households.
My young friends, the days of examination are getting closer.
Anshul Sharma, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, has been asking MyGov to talk about the selections and Exam Warriors.
Anshul ji, I am grateful to you for presenting this thing.
Yes, many families have the first part of the year.
Students, their parents and teachers are all in the process of selection.
Moreover, many students from abroad will also be participating in this event.
I am talking to our young friends about all aspects related to the examinations in this Pariksha Bay Church, particularly about unconscious examinations.
I have been asking many people to send inputs and comments for this.
I am happy that a large number of people are sharing their ideas in MyGov.
I will surely present some of these suggestions and suggestions during the Down Hall event.
You must participate in this event...
You can also see its direct broadcast through social media and Namo App.
May this journey be successful in 2019.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
It is only then that the benefits of experiences are an opportunity to us and the self-confidence of making a new one.
What we do is not only change in our lives, but also contribute to the development of the country and the society.

All of these have been reflected in the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Jayachandran was accompanied by Lord.
People say he was at any time trying to treat patients.
Likewise, Sulkitti Narmada from Karnataka also joined Lord on December 25.
Sulkitti Narma was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded Padmasri Award.
When we talk about healthcare, I want to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of our party told me that some young doctors have been camping in the city and providing free treatment to the poor.
Every month, many poor patients are benefitting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these medical friends who are in service with a sense of selflessness is really commendable.
Today, I am very proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement due to social efforts.
A few days ago, some people told me that in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people were together in the Swachhta movement.
In this magnificence of cleanliness, all the people from all walks of life, including municipalities, autonomous organisations, students of schools and colleges, and people of Jabalpur were very enthusiastic.
The success stories of innovative youth and entrepreneurs are clearly described in com.
Well, will we do a job
Shall we share such websites with us
We all have a positive feeling.
This will lead to greater people to understand our heroes that make changes in society.
There is a great significance for sports in all communities.
When playing, the minds of those who see it are filled with strength.
We feel many things like the name, identity and respect of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things in their background and more things than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanya Nisar, a girl from Kashmir, who won the Gold Medal in Krate in Korea.

When these achievements are asked about such successes, don't we have imagination
The names of all these festivals are different, but there is a feeling of celebrating all these festivals, somehow or the other or the other organisations are connected with harvesting and sweets, mixed with villages and harvesting with crops.
During this time, the sun rises and the sun goes into the Mahar Rasi.
After that, gradually, the day starts increasing and the winter crops start cutting.
My best wishes to the farmers brothers and sisters of our country.
The feeling of unity in diversity - Ek Bharat, Universe India, smells through our festivals.

At the same time millions of foreigners of the country are connected to one place.

May this spiritual Kumbh be the glory of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the glory of the nation.
May this Kumbh of devotees be the pride of national unity and be the pride of the world tourist.
Babu had an unconnected connection with South Africa.
This is what Mohen is in South Africa.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and made a resolution against diversity.
He set up Finnish and Dalsty plants, from where voices for peace and justice were shouting all over the world.
He was found from the bravery and inspiration that he had spent many years in prison.
What do you know about Mandela ji's oil, "The Indians were an integral part of our history, so here he conducted his first test with his mouth
Here he expressed his commitment to justice.
This is where he devised the path of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle," he said.

The Prime Minister said, "There is no conflict with the weak and the power cannot be shown.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it is a great service to overcome the grief of humanity.
He was a privilege of bravery, warmth, sacrifice and rituals.
In addition, Gurumukhi, Brajpasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were specialists in many languages.

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, on the third day of Vijayadasamy, we all made a journey through Mann Ki Baat.
This time, the letters and telephone applications from you are mostly related to this 50th part.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jane from Narendra Modi App, Prasenjit Sarkar from West Bengal, Sangeeta Sastry from Nagpur, etc.
Your interest is natural.
In today's era, why is Modi connecting through radio while almost forgetting radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working in the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
And he said, Take a ladder placed in a cotton vessel that was with him, and eat the laddu before the tea was made.
I was surprised to know why, what was the matter, what happened to someone in the house like a marriage.
No, brother, don't you know
I'm the only understanding.
Behold, listen to the first radio.
They were talking about it in the radio.
In this forest area, in such an unpopular area, in the midst of the snowy mountains, a common man is selling tea freely and asking for radio throughout the day.
That's why I am not surprised to return my attention to the milk of the most powerful media as Prime Minister.
Mann Ki Baat was inspired by the devotion of the far-flung villages to cities, from farmers to young industrialists.
Millions of letters were read every month, phone calls were asked, criticisms were made on the App and MyGov
The journey of these 50 regions, which were connected to one house and provided in an interesting manner, is connected with all of us.
Now the All India Radio and Mann Ki Baat Survey have also been conducted.
Some of the subsequent backgrounds are very interesting.
70 percent of those who have been examined are constantly asking for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
He said that there is a positive feeling in the society, and it is the greatest part of Mann Ki Baat.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat has encouraged mass movements.
There are widespread discussions on indipositive.
All of them underscore the positive sympathy and negative feelings of our countrymen.
People are sharing their feelings that the voice of mind has increased self-confidence.
The idea of joining social service is a major change in the minds of the people.
But people are not connected only through this programme.
The people of Mann Ki Baat are playing their role in television, FMMNOLI, mobile, Internet, Facebook Direct Broadcasting, Pariscope and Narendra Modi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the entrepreneurs of the family for trusting the voice of Mann Ki Baat and turning into a part of it.
Your doubts are right.
At the end of their study, it was also a result that the program was unpolitical.
When Mann Ki Baat began, I had decided that Modi should not be seen anywhere in it, and that it should not be political or laying back to the government.
It is clear that the anticipations of the leaders in letters, websites and telephone calls that have come before every voice of mind.
Modi will come and go, but this country will last forever and will not be destroyed by our culture.
Small stories of 130 crore Indians will never be hidden.
I read the letter and if this sensitivity has emerged in another letter then I also permit it.
I also share my experience and share with you.
And no state has the power to spread awareness and widespread awareness of the movement called Selphy with daughters, from a small village in Aryan to all over the country and abroad.
When every section of the society and the well-known people are mixed up in a new dimension of change in society, it understands today's generation and creates unawareness.
India's Annamma is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one of them is political.
It is not a good system for a healthy society if all is done in politics.
Sometimes political events and politicians dominate, the other capabilities and other efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thank you for your phone call.
In a way, you've been asked because of your own acceptance.
If I have to answer your question directly, I don't apply to any producer in Mussoorie.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is the easiest job for me.
People's letters are coming before every voice of mind.
That letter is not just paper for me
Indeed, for about 40-45 years, I have lived a saint's life and I have gone to most of the districts of the country and I have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
In fact, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is mine, but examples, feelings and feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to tell the immigration of lakhs of such people to this day, but they are listening to their letters and their comments without any disappointment.
I am confident that your thoughts will be more than ever before and your thoughts will contribute to making the mindset more interesting and more terrible.
Efforts are being made to constitute a department regarding the letters and comments that are not in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from all India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social networks.
In this way, they will become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude to all of them for their capabilities and capabilities.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your state languages.
Any political media will always have no happiness, but the lowest coverage, which is negative.
But the media made many things raised in Mann Ki Baat.
The media has done a lot of things like Swachhta, Road Safety, Non-Narcotics India and a telephone with daughters and have been working to transform it into a mission.
If there were no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Financial, thank you for your phone call.
To tell the truth, I have no secret.
It makes it easier to understand anybody until the fruits that are in our lives are contradicted.
Sometimes, we talk about the difference in information exchange between the elders and the adults in the families.
In fact, most of the prosperous people have lost their speeches.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through special events and social websites.
I have always been trying to eradicate what they do or what they think.
Through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I am giving great importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I don't think there is no time to live with the youth, this is what helps the youngsters to build more innovations because they are thinking of swiftly finishing the work.
We feel that today's youth are more skilled and think of big things.
Good, let them dream, let them make big successes.
Some people say that younger generations are going to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you, what's wrong with this
At the same time, the scholars do a lot of work.
Be it social entrepreneurship, startups, sports or other sectors, the youth who make a big change in society.
These youngsters start asking questions, they have the power to dream.
If we sustain the thoughts of our youth on the earth, if we create a free environment to shape them then we can make a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, I urge you people to talk about the Constitution Day to be held on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat, Vinita ji from Gurugram.
Why is this day important, he has also registered us in the 70th year we have adopted our Constitution.
Vinita ji, thank you very much for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Emergency Law Day.
This is the day when we remember those people who have given us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days to the Constituent Assembly to fulfil the legislative task of the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these men have adopted such a broad and deeper emergency law.
They are still an example of direct governance and manufacturing in accordance with the rapid pace of creation of the Armed Forces Act.
We also imagine to fulfil our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The significance of our Constitution is that it describes in detail the obligations and rights.
It is a memorable event to adhere to awareness about the Constitution Act and to link them to various aspects of the Constitution.
In 2020, as a Republic, we are going to complete 70 years of our journey and we will complete 75 years of independence by 2022.
Come, let us take the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should never forget the contribution of that man who was the center of the Constituent Assembly.
That man is a bowl doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On December 6, the day of his Mahaparinirvana i.e., he became a member.
I pay my tributes to Baba Saheb for all the people of the country and he gave the right to live with dignity of millions of Indians.
Democracy is an integral part of Baba Saheb's nature and India's democratic values are not imported from outside.
Democracy and Parliament are not new things for India.
Once again, my service to Babasaheb, which was recited to me.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, the birth anniversary of Runnak Dev ji was celebrated next year, in 2019, we are going to celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had always thought of the welfare of humanity.
He always guided the path of opportunity, work, service, blessings and brotherhood in the society.
All the States and Union Territories have been asked to celebrate this day in a very good manner.
Similarly, Guru Nanak Dev Jis 550th birth anniversary will be celebrated all over the world.
Moreover, there will be a train on the path of the holy places related to Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Now, when I participated in a meeting related to this, I was questioned about Lakhbad Sahib Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, there was a major impact on that Gurudwara.
But it is still an example that the state government has revived it in collaboration with those circles.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th part of the Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and I have the opportunity to expose the feelings of Mann Ki Baat for the first time before you.
The more I connect with you, our journey will be deeper and will be happy to all.
The question of what I got from the voice of Mann Ki Baat can be raised in the minds of some people.
Today, I would like to say that when all the family members sit together and listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, our family leaders sit in us and share with us about our issues.
Your best wishes, my shoes.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires, and my desires.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, our descendant Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
This year the youth of the country will be willing to participate in the Ekta Route.
The climate is still unprecedented.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the loneliness movement.
About six months before the country's independence, on January 27, 1947, the world-renowned international press, Tim, was on its first side with the photograph of Sardar Patel.
In the headlines of that day, they also released the map of India
But that map isn't like it's now.
India showcased the map.
It had more than 550 similarities.
When they left the country, they were in the hope that India should be part of a variety.
The Times commented that India was facing various threats such as separation, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel said that Sardar Vallabhbhai could integrate the country and cure the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article was also on the other side of the history of the life of India's iron man.
The article concluded in the 1920s, when the flood took place in Ahmedabad, in his hand, the way he carried out the relief measures and the Berdoli Satyagraha.
His honesty and commitment was so much that he had full faith in the peasants, workers and industrialists.
Sardar Patel took every issue and resolved to integrate the country as he was suppressing the war through a single-scale fear.
He ensured that all the communities in the country are connected to a united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad or Bangalore, whether it is equalities in Rajasthan, if we see an integrated India now, then it is the main reason for Sardar Patel's sensitivity and vision.
This statue, built on the banks of the Narmada river of Gujarat, is twice high like the statue of the US Independence.
This will be the world's highest applicant statue.
Every Indian will be proud when the world's highest statue is built in India.
Sardar Patel, the real friend of our soil, will decorate our airspace.
I am confident that this statue, which has honoured the mother of India, will be proud of every Indian.
Because the desire to see the Statue of Unity is natural for every Indian.
I am confident that this statue will be a place where people from all over the country want to see.
My dear brothers and sisters, we all celebrated Kaladpadi Day yesterday.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian defence forces.
I salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know why we are celebrating this day as Kaladpadi.
Indian forces took a footstep in Kashmir today and saved the valley from being unconscious of the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview with our prestigious military officer Sham Maneksha.
In this, Field Marshal Sham Maneksha recalled the time he was blessed.
At that time, the military operations in Kashmir started.
In a meeting at that time, Field Marshal Maneksha pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was cut off for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, and noted that there should be any delay in sending troops, and that Sardar Patel gave a clear instruction to the issue quickly.
If our armies fled to Kashmir then we can know how our army worked successfully.
The memory of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is coming on 31st October.
Let us pay homage to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who do not want to play.
If our youth have these capabilities, our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technologies but will also find pride in sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I complimented them and their resolve to break the barriers and win will be inspiring to all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You know that during the summer Olympics 2018, our youths activity was so excellent.
We got 13 medals in this competition and got three medals in the dissolution double category.
You must remember that the activity of Indian soldiers was very excellent in the recently concluded Asian Games.
You must have noticed that I have often mentioned the word "I am excellent or undisclosed achievement".
This is a real position to reflect the progress made by Indias sports sector every day.
India is making new achievements not only in the field of sports but also in innumerable sectors.
For instance, I would like to indicate to you the handicapped sportsperson, Narayan Pharaoh, who won the Gold in Asian Games 2018 for handicapped people.
He's a disabled person at the beginning.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
After that, eight years of support lived in the house.
He then left the house and cleaned the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and lived on the roadside food habits.
The same Narayan has won the medal on behalf of India in international competitions.
It should also be noted that how fast the Indian sports sector is getting higher.
Moreover, India has not won the medal in Junior or Chinese category so far in Judo.
However, India's Tababi Devi won a silver medal in the Youth Olympics and won a historic achievement.
Tababi Devi was 16 years old, from a Kukgram in Manipur.
His father is a common worker, a mother fisherman.
It's a time without money even to buy food.
In such a poor situation, his interest and dedication have not been reduced.
He has won a medal for the country and has a history.
The entire world complimented that this competition was successful.
FIFA has achieved the World Cup Competition for 17 years of age and the number of those who have seen in the field.
Over 12 lakh sportspersons have seen footpath competitions in different sports stadiums in the country and have encouraged young soldiers.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host Hockey Competitions in Bhubaneswar, 2018 World Cup.
The World Cup hockey competition will be held from November 28 to December 16.
Every Indian, whether he plays or is interested in any sports, he is surely interested in hockey competition.
In the Hockey Games, India has achieved the achievements of the golden jewels.
India has won gold and won the World Championships once in various events.
India has also created a lot of excellent hockey soldiers.
Whenever he cited Hockey sports, we cannot fulfil it without mentioning our achievements.
The name of Major Dayanchand, considered to be the father of Hockey, is famous all over the world.
Further, Balbir Singh Chinese, Lesley Glaciers Mohammad Shahid, Uttamsingh to Dhanrajbulla have a long tradition of Indian Hockey.
Even today, the soldiers in the Indian team are encouraging younger generations with their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the most beautiful competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourage Indian teams and every brave person who are playing there.
Odisha is not only the best historical background but also the cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very bad.
This is a unique opportunity to see the sportspersons of Odisha.
The world famous pilgrimage places like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannathar Temple and Silka Lake can also be enjoyed with sports competitions.
I extend my best wishes to the Indian male team participating in this competition and also ensure that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I extend my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the morale of those who have come forward to work in the society is actually inspiring and encouraging the people of the country.
But in the present new era, new generations are innovative and enthusiastic with innovation and innovation.
I participated in the inaugural function of a new Internet Account I for Community and the programme of my Government and the programme of Information Technology and Electronics Industry of the country, in order to encourage the workers to work in social activities and to provide them opportunities in this field.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
I don't - we have transformed the society from individuals to individuals and created a new environment for social work in the field of Information Technology.
Some people are singing to the aged
Some are dedicating themselves to cleanliness and some are helping the farmers.
But after whose action they have no perspective, their commitment to drive.
But one who is sitting in the cycle chair and learning to play can help the handicapped and handicapped sportspersons who are participating in the cycle chamber.
This feeling and dedication is an activity.
It will make every Indian proud.
We are not me, we will certainly be attractive to all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, when you looked at your suggestions on the Mann Ki Baat today, the idea of Mr. Manish Mahpatra from Puducherry was very encouraging.
Through the App, My Government has said that the tribals and their heritage and traditions have to take part in the Mann Ki Baat programme as an example of the nature.
He said how to pursue the traditions of tribals in our lives, and what can be known from such traditions.
I compliment you for bringing this issue to the leaders of Mann Ki Baat.
It will inspire us to understand our glorious past and ancient traditions, especially when the entire world is discussing the environmental protection and exploring new ways to pursue a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing the same problem.
However, if we want to solve it, it is important to recall our past gold and understand our traditional wealth, especially the lifestyle of our tribal people.
Music in close collaboration with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribals.
Our tribal brothers and sisters salute the trees, plants and flowers as God.
The tribes of Bil, who live in Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees of Beepal and Arjun.
The Bishnoi class, who lives in the desert of Rajasthan, guides us to how to protect the environment.
In particular, they are willing to give their lives rather than hurting a tree in the protection of trees.
The Mismi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh are associated with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the LTTE has become a forest guard.
The Varli ethnic people of Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their representatives and the LTTE reflects their prosperity.
The Gol race of central India considers the LTTE as a direct link to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be ruled by the duck.
During the period of fishing, the Gondu ethnic people of central India stop fishing on the river Kaithan.
They consider this area as a wildlife sanctuary, as a result of this belief that nutritious fish will be available in abundance.
At the same time, the tribals also set up their habitations with strong and environment friendly natural products.
The territorial people living in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of southern south are setting up their habitations only with the goods available in the area.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony that the tribal people are dependent on living with peace and harmony, and if anybody tries to harm or harm their natural resources, they will not be able to fight for their rights.
It is no wonder that many of our freedom fighters were leading soldiers, belonging to tribal society.
Nobody can forget Lord Birsamunda, who fought hard against British imperialism to protect their forests.
In addition to what I have mentioned, we can list a lot of tribal communities that have been taught about how to co-operate with nature, and we are very obliged to our tribal people to continue to be forests and forests in the country.
Everybody should come forward to express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we have spoken of individuals and organisations that have played an incredible role in society on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
However, these things are not enough, but they have inspired deep feelings in our thoughts to show a new way to work for society.
Just a few days ago, I had read about the farmer brothers of Punjab, Kurbachan Singh.
Kurbachan Singh's son is scheduled to be married.
Kurbachan Singh has told her parents that this marriage should be done very easily.
He said there was no need to spend a large amount of money for marriage welcome or anything else.
He said that it should be considered as a very ordinary monster, and has suddenly imposed a condition.
He has promised that women's households do not have to put their outcome on the ground and burn agricultural wastes.
You must consider the social strength of this idea well.
However, this indicates how high his well-being is and how many families of our society solve their personal problems to the entire society.
The family members of Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh have shown us such examples.
I also read about the village Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning potholes, Kalarmajra village has come to light from the farmers following the new technologies of swallowing them with soil.
Congratulations to Kurbachan Singh
I compliment the people of Kalarmajra village and all those who do not have any destruction in their surroundings.
You all have become a real way to take forward the Indian tradition with a healthy lifestyle.
Every creative activity is necessary to create a better environment as the sea is formed by a small drop of water consolidation.
My dear countrymen, our myths also describe this, saying, O marvel, we have to enjoy peace in all the creations of water, air, land, fire, breath, medicines, plantations, gardens, deepening.
Every soul, every heart, every heart in me and in you, should be peaceful anywhere.
Om Shanti: Peace:
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be demolished by golden writings.
For India, it is important on November 11 this year, because a hundred years ago, the first World War ended on November 11.
We feel that when the war is over a hundred years, the catastrophe and human deaths are over and over a hundred years.
For India, the First World War is very important.
In fact, we have no direct connection with that war.
However, our soldiers have fought bravely and sacrificed the highest sacrifices in that war.
Indian soldiers have also explained that if the war comes, Indians are not slaughtering anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery and bravery in the terrible areas and in bad weather.
The only objective was to make peace.
The world knows that during the First World War, there were large numbers of lives and materials.
Nearly one crore soldiers and the same number of innocent people are reported to have died.
This is what the whole world felt the significance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only a war but also a global collaboration and integration to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poor is the real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states are special.
The natural beauty of the North-East has nothing to do with, the people of the region are also very skilled.
The North-Eastern states are now famous for their special activities.
The North-Eastern region has grown significantly in organic farming.
In order to encourage sustainable food habits, the State of Sikkim has received the Golden Prize for valued future policy 2018 a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has won the award, but has retreated the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I heartily congratulate the people of Sikkim for this.
I am confident that such festivals will be an opportunity to accept new pledges.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you grow, this country will also grow.
My best wishes to you all.
