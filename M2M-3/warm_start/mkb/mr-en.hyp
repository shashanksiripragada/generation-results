Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Deepjyotirnamostute
I salute such DivyaJyoti.
What can be the better idea to remember this Deepawali, let us pray to light everywhere, spread positiveity and destroy the spirit of enmity.
Today, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is participating in it, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations of the country celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way India can be realized there .
Friends, Festival tourism in the world had its own attraction.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has huge potential for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal or Bihu, we should try to join the people of other states and other countries by spreading such festivals in the pleasure of festivals.
We have so many festivals in each state and in every area - the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, it would have been possible to do something faster in this Diwali.
I used to say, let us all celebrate the great success of India's women's strength and three achievements on this Diwali.
Soon after this, there were innumerable inspirational stories in the social media.
Kodepka Ramesh of Warangal wrote on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
When my children died in 1990, my mother took the responsibility of five children.
Today, we are among the five good businesses.
Ramesh ji, I salute my mothers.
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that India's Laxmi on Major Khushboo, who is the daughter of a bus driver and he was leading all the women of Assam Rifles.
For poems Tiwari ji, India's Laxmi is his daughter and his strength too.
They are proud of their daughters paintings.
He has also received a very good category in the CLAT examination.
A 92-year-old woman is providing free water to the passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghazi has been inspired by the spirit of humility and compassion of Lakshmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by people.
You must read, inspire and do some similar work in the surrounding areas.
I salute all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sanchi Honma, a well known poet of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
That is what we are talking about every Laxmi of India, it seems that its foundation was laid in the 17th century.
How beautiful words, how beautiful thoughts and ideas are there in this poem in Kannada.
Our daughters, this is our pride and because of the gloriousness of these legends, our society has a strong identity and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, this is the day on 12th November, 2019 that the 550th Light Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but all over the world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have lived in many countries of the world, which are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to the gurudwaras of Vancover and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, which I can tell you, but for that there will be many parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept the service spirit in the highest place.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believes that the service work done by the selfless feelings cannot be supplied.
He stood firmly against socially bad practices such as untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji had delivered his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers in our times.
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone because of his direct nature, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Devji had visited several important religious places which were said to be sad.
With the message of goodwill and equality, it is the north, the east, the west, the west, the people, the sages and sages met everywhere.
It was believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam had also inspired him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
He is dedicated to Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, a famous place named Bidar, which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
During a grief, Guru Nanak ji travelled in the north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This led to a strong relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet where people considered him a guru.
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had gone.
During his grief, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Those people who have followed their teachings and are still doing it.
A few days ago, the messengers of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and this happened on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers had visited the Golden Temple and they had the opportunity to know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Several messengers then took photographs on social media and wrote gloriously about the best experiences.
I wish that Guru Nanak Dev ji's 550th Prakash Parv will give us more inspiration to bring his ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that on 31st October, all of you will be remembered.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron male of India, who was the greatest cave in the throne of unity.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a magnificent capacity to bring people together and on the other hand, he used to mix with those with whom he had a ideological distinction.
Sardar Patel used to go deeply and look at small things.
The true meaning is that he was the Man of Details, which has been inspired by the discipline.
At the same time, he was skilled in the organization.
Thousands of representatives from all over the country were coming to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system to the city.
It was decided that nobody would suffer from water shortage.
Moreover, we will be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had done this thing in view of any representative's goods or pairs going to Chori.
He urged the farmers to connect with the farmers and make khadi pipes.
The farmers made the same push and sold it to the representatives.
In these pushes wear your shoes and the pushes were kept with you and the tension of the representatives going to the shoe chari was lost.
On the other hand, the sale of fertilizer has increased significantly.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He took important tasks to determine the fundamental rights, so that no discrimination can be made on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a very great Bhagirath and historic work to unite institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai had the same specialty that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, there was talk of his geography about some special states in the integration of the country.
He told Mudaliyar brothers, Arkot Ramaswamy Mudaliyar and Arkot Laxmanswamy Mudaliyar that he should take the people of Travancore to the spot and hoist the tricolor there.
The tricolor was hoisted immediately after his command and the neighbours of Lakshadweep were destroyed to see the mindset of the country.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that Lakshadweep will get every necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that we will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the foundation stone of unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018.
This is the highest effigy in the world.
The height of the statue of the freedom fighter of America is double.
The highest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian has a strong sense of dignity.
You will be happy that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the effigy of unity.
This means that every day about six and a half thousand people see the grandeur of unity.
He expressed his faith and reverence in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now several attraction centres such as Selectung gardens, Flowers Parks, Forest Safari, Nutrition Food Parks, Ekta Nursery for children have been growing steadily and it is boosting the local economy and providing new employment opportunities to the people.
Keeping in mind the convenience of tourists coming, people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homes.
Professional training is also being given to those who provide accommodation facilities at home.
I am confident that the people of the country have started dragon-fruit farming and it will soon be the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the pupil of unity can be a subject of practice.
We are all witnesses that how a place was developing as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People from all over the country and abroad come there.
Several arrangements such as transportation, blockage, guide, environmental supplementary systems are developing on their own.
There is a huge economic movement and people are building facilities according to the requirements of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, In the last month, the Time Month has placed the foundation of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations in the world.
I hope you all take some time from our precious time to see the effigy of unity.
But I urge every Indian who takes the time to travel with at least 15 tourist destinations in India, wherever he goes, it will continue to be my request.
Friends, As you know, every year 31 October is celebrated as National Integration Day since 2014.
This day inspires us to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any value.
On 31st October, the run for unity is being organised every year.
It will include people from every section of society and from every level.
Run for unity indicates that this country is one and is moving towards one and seeing a goal.
However, nowadays there is a verse and verse about marathons in the people.
Run for Unity is also the same instance.
We are also running here for a fit India and also for a fit India-Shreshtha Bharat.
And this is not only the body but also the mind and culture to take India to new heights for the unity of India.
For this, you can know about the run for unity around you in the cities where you live.
On the portal in the country where run for unity is going to be organised.
We will all run on 31st October for the unity of India and for our own well-being.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel built the country in the threshold of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a culture in our lives and we must continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage, in a variety of countries like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Ram Janmabhoomi had given his salvation to the Allahabad High Court.
If you remember that day, how was the atmosphere
How many people had come to the ground.
How the interest-related groups were playing games to take advantage of that situation.
What kind of language was used to feed the environment.
Efforts were also made to fill bitterness in different voices.
On the one hand, there was a lot of responsibilities, but when the Ram Janmabhoomi came to an end, the government, the political party, the social organization, the civil society, the representatives of all communities, the sadhu saints gave a very restraint response.
Efforts to reduce environmental tensions.
But I still remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is the example of unity, how power it gives to the country.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed on 31st October.
I pay homage to the nation today.
My dear countrymen, today a story is being heard from far and wide in every village, from north to south, from east to west and from every corner of India, it is cleanliness.
Every person, every family, every village should have a pleasant experience in cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is an effort of 1. 25 billion Indians.
The owners of their results are also 1. 25 billion Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I heard, I think, let us also tell you.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield where temperature slides from zero to 50 to 60 degrees.
The climate in the air is named after the name .
In such a difficult situation, living in such challenges is not less than parameters.
In such a terrible situation, our external soldiers are protecting the borders of the country by pressing their chest but they are running a clean syachin campaign.
I compliment the people of the country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I thank you.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to have some disintegration.
In such a situation, distributing and managing waste is an important task.
In such a situation, 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surroundings and that too, in such a delicate environment, this service is so big.
We all know that Siachen is a part of the rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness drive here means ensuring clean water for those who live in the following areas and use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shuk.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a new conscious festival in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, some or the other thing is being brought from the market.
The more we try to buy local goods, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity.
And I urge you to buy something that is made of the hand of our weavers and the hand of our weavers.
Even in this Diwali, we must have bought a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who will be able to get a little cheaper if they go after Diwali.
There will be many people whose purchases have remained.
While conveying the best wishes to Deepawali, I would like to urge you to buy local goods.
The dreams of Mahatma Gandhi can play an important role.
But sometimes fire starts staying unconscious .
Somewhere injury occurs.
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2018
Every Indian, whether it is a region, caste, religion, sect or language, is always ready to express happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 1. 25 billion Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the distinctions made in 2016 when our soldiers responded sufficiently to those who snatched away from terrorism.
In different parts of the country, our Armed Forces showcased exhibitions so that the maximum number of citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, can understand their capabilities.
How capable we are and we can know how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives on their side.
On the occasion of Parakram Parva recalls the glorious heritage of our armed forces and inspires us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also attended a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of Shurvira.
It is certain that our soldiers will respond to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We are committed to encouraging peace and we are committed to encouraging it, but we have never been able to afford the value of dignity and the value of the country's sovereignty.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was an observation by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries that send more soldiers to the United Nations in different peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our soldiers have played an important role in serving peace across the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, the thing of the sky is different.
One of the keen interests of the people in the Republic Day programme is the Fly Post in which our Air Force reflects their capabilities by reflecting the sympathy of air.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force and their families who serve the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistani counterpart launched an indirect attack, the Air Force sweared that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield on time to protect Srinagar.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in getting rid of snoring in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, the Air Force dustbined them while raining at the hostages of the enemy.
Whether it is help and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable achievements of our Air Force.
Their work to tackle natural calamities and help the people of the country is amazing.
The Air Force has made an ideal in ensuring the equality of men and women in the country, they have opened the doors of every department for girls.
Now the Air Force is also offering an alternative to the short service commission and the Permanent Commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that our armed forces are contributing to male power as well as female power.
Women are empowered and now they are being armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, an officer of the Navy, Abhilash Tomy, used to bow down to life and death.
The entire country was worried about how to save them.
You all know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave hero.
He is the first Indian officer to travel to the world by taking a small name from any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, in the South Indian Ocean, he used to keep his speed in the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race, but the terrible marine wind created a crisis against them but the Indian Navy's brave navigation continued to swing in the ocean for several days.
I pray for Abhilash Tommy's good health and that is why it will inspire the younger generation of our country to enjoy adventurous, their valour, their determination and live.
My dear countrymen, a small child also knows what is important for our country on 2nd October.
There is another special significance this year on 2nd October.
From now on, we are going to make several programmes worldwide on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, everybody gained strength from Gandhis ideas and gave a long fight to give our people the right to equality and dignity.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I want to discuss another important task of our revered Bapu, which most people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, when he stressed on the freedom struggle, he prepared a revised image of these ideas.
Our ideas have been placed before the people of the country on the subjects such as the protection of the rights of the farmers, the villages, the rights of the workers, the spread of cleanliness and education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Popular Bapu was a collection of people.
It was the habit of Bapu to connect people with them.
Everybody had ever experienced their next features.
He gave everyone the experience that the person is the most important and extremely important for the country.
The biggest contribution in the freedom struggle is that he gave this war a mass movement.
Replying to the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi in the movement of freedom struggle, the people of every section and every section of the society shook themselves.
Bapu gave you an inspirational mantra.
So can he overcome his life and part...
This will enable millions of people to get self-reliance, those who are hungry and their souls are untouched.
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and egoism has started ending.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, their growing economic strengths, increasing purchase power and some purchases can we remember Bapu for a moment.
Whoever is fortunate, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly...
If the poorest of the poor gets the benefit then I will be more happy.
Keeping in mind the mantra of Gandhiji, while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the coming days, we must pay attention to the fact that some country should be built by our purchases and those who have lost their sweat, their money and their talent should be benefited in some way.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that this small step can change the lives of the poorest and weakest.
But this was achieved, India got freedom.
Today, we can feel that my small work can also contribute to the economic progress and economic empowerment of my country and to the strength to fight against poverty.
In today's era, this is a true patriotic, it has been done by the revered Bapu.
He said that all these khadi garments have been made very carefully, every thread should be used.
The spirit of self-confidence towards the country and the spirit of affection towards the people of the country was distinguished in the mortality of this childhood.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
The name of Shastri ji is high and the feeling of immense faith is blossoming in the minds of the people of India.
His brave personality is always proud of every Indian.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined from the heart to the mountain.
The announcement of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is the identity of his unique personality.
This was the result of his selfless investigation towards the nation that in a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the youth and farmers of the country to reach the height of success.
My dear countrymen, if we remember the revered Bapu today then it is natural that we will not be able to talk about cleanliness.
Swachhata Hi Seva Abhiyan was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this event and I got the privilege of working with the students of Ambedkar School, Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by Babasaheb himself.
People from all over the country participated in this workshop on 15th.
Heriri also participated in the organization.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organizations, Media Groups and Private Industries all performed a large scale sanitation work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world.
This time, India is organizing the largest World Cleanliness Summit in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Summit, Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from all over the world are collectively experimenting their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded on 2nd October, 2018 at the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit that justice is justified by the roots of Swaraj, when there is a discussion of justice then the feeling of human rights is inherent.
It is particularly essential to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited and deprived.
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was set up on 12th October, 1993, inspired by his vision.
NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked to protect human rights and enhance human dignity.
Our dear leader, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made it clear that human rights are not our foreign concepts.
All the buildings of the Vedic period are engraved in the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission:
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
In this 25-year journey, this Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and trust among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been set up at the national level.
It is the basis of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' that needs to be understood and brought into practice the importance of human rights as a society.
This year also, with your efforts, organise Run for Unity in our villages, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb for unity because he worked for unity throughout his life.
On 31st October, I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to enhance every section of society and every section of the country in the field of unity, through the Run for Unity will be their best tributes.
My dear countrymen, I convey my heartfelt greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today Raksha Purnima is being celebrated all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy day.
Raksha Bandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and belief among the daughters of sisters and brothers.
Now Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
The climate of the horse, horse, palanquin-jay Kanhaiyalal Ki, Govinda-Govinda is going to be depicted all over the world.
The pleasure of going colored in the color of Lord Krishna is somewhat different .
Sir, Sanskrit - Dinamasti.
Sanskrit languages are simplicity.
Brothers and sisters, along with Rakshabandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Diwas.
At the same time, we are proud of the fact that we have played a very important role in spreading knowledge from the Vedic times to the present Sanskrit language.
In Sanskrit language and literature, knowledge is a treasure in every field of life.
Not only this, it is also said that the mantras that give detailed answers are mentioned in Sanskrit language.
You all will be happy to know that the people of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka use Sanskrit language even today.
You will be surprised to know that the Sanskrit language has a special feature of creating new words in this language.
What is the significance of Guru in life , it has been said in a clear narrative that sometimes in letters , Gurus , disciples in the address .
My dear countrymen, Monsoon rains are bringing new aspirations for our farmers who have worked hard and hard work.
This rain becomes a boon for sand, dry trees and dried trees and reservoirs due to severe heat.
But sometimes it brings very humidity and humiliating Mahapur.
Heavy rains have occurred in comparison to other places in the country.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity should improve their nature at the earliest.
But during such a crisis, we also see humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari everybody at their own level, whether it is in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He tried tirelessly to save the lives of those who were stuck in Pura.
Be it airplanes or naval personnel, Border Security Forces, CISFs, RAFs and all sections of the Army have played a very important role in the rescue and rescue operations.
In this sacred period of Onam, we pray that the country, especially Kerala, should get the strength to get out of this crisis as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala should be speeded up.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of the country where such an enormous crisis has emerged.
For the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
However, after August 16, the country and the world have seen that even after this ten years, there was a lot of affection for Atal ji in the minds of the common man of India.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has led to two important changes in the politics of India.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limits fixed under the Anti-Pacific Act were one-third, increased to two-thirds.
A clear guidelines have also been set to eligible the participants for their participants.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time of the country's budget was changed in the House.
In the year 2001, Atal ji changed the time of the budget in Parliament to one and a half in the morning.
Some of the rules in this regard have made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Therefore, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flags.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our favourite tricolor to the people.
In this regard, people are asking for their opinions as a protester.
I pay homage to Atal ji on behalf of all of you, by reiterating his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You must be happy to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had imposed only five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
In Rajasthan, in the same way, the courts there have decided on the cases of atrocities against women.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing the atrocities committed by women and children.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
In this monsoon session of Parliament, all the members have put together an ideal objective.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of Indians has been towards the Asian Games in Jakarta.
ASEAN sports is still in progress.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has increased, particularly our daughters are involved in it, which indicates a lot of positive sign.
Keep in mind your fitness, because a healthy, healthy country will be able to create a prosperous and prosperous India.
My best wishes, I respect your feelings.
Everybody is surprised to see that Patna is the Rani Ki Baw built in the 21st century in Gujarat.
The land of India has to be said as a laboratory of engineering.
Several engineers of India have come to the forefront that they can only imagine.
We have received such a blood in our tradition that indicates the heritage of great engineers.
This blood is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishwaswaraya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefiting lakhs of farmers and people.
It is called Bhunga in Kutch.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in these houses.
I have experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But go inside and see, you will not see any damage.
This house has been built by our ancestors according to the nature and geographical structure here and according to the environment.
After seeing the house, I thought that even before several ages, the engineers of that period had considered the local situation and how they had constructed a house in accordance with the conditions that the people could be safe.
Now whenever we celebrate 'Engineers' Day', we must also think of the future.
Workshops should be done at places.
What new things should we learn during the changing times
What should be taught to people
How should we connect
Today, disaster management has become a big task.
The entire world has to face natural crisis.
How can we have a new form of infrastructure engineering
How will it have different courses
What should the students learn in this
Many such things should be considered when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
At the same time, the preparation of Diwali is going to be started.
In Mann Ki Baat, we will continue to meet and talk to the mind.
At the same time, we will continue to work towards taking our country forward.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
While some parts of the country are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is enormous and there is a diversity in it, but sometimes the king of Varun also shows the form of his choice.
In such a scenario, the most important responsibility is that all of us should become nature-loving, nature-saving, nature-saving.
If we also become nature then the balance of natural things will be done on its own.
You must have seen this incident on the telephone.
Actually going to that cave it takes usually a few hours to return back .
When we came to know that it was not coming out, these children took shelter at a little higher height in the cave.
But they didn't have to stay for one or two days but they had to stay in 18 days.
Now we can imagine how their moments and moments have gone in a mental situation when there is a direct death in front.
On the one hand, these children were bowing their hands with crisis and on the other hand, humanity from all over the world used to come together and showcase the human qualities of God.
Specially, after seeing everybody's extremely restraint behavior, I feel that this is a learning and learning quality.
Those whose children were stuck inside, their parents were not sad or their mothers were not suffering from untouchability.
But patience, patience and compassion, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is very important and we all have to learn.
A young man from Thailand had to lose his lives in the entire campaign of this helper.
All these youngsters showed the bravery of patience and patience of helping the cave in a very difficult situation filled with water and darkness.
It shows that when humanity is gathering, such marvellous things happen.
However, we need to focus only on the peaceful and stable minds and for which we are working.
A few days ago, our dear poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was a specialty.
He believed in hope, belief and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and powerful to all Indians.
In fact, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers brothers and all the youth.
Because during this period there is a problem of admission of colleges .
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school life and enter the college.
The youngsters are walking on a new path of life, so their focus comes out of the question and comes upon the cut-off.
The attention of the students is now taken from home to the habitation.
Students have come out of the shadows of their parents and come under the roof of the professors.
I am sure my youngsters will be very excited about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, you would have left the house and you would have to leave the village and come out of a safe environment and become your own partner.
How many youths are going to leave their homes for the first time to give a different and new direction to their lives.
I would like to tell all of you that you should be calm and enjoy this life.
There is a need to study but while learning the natural zeal of finding out new things should be maintained in you.
Old friends have a special turn.
I was watching the news of how a student named ASHARAM Chaudhari had achieved academic success in dealing with many difficulties in life in a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh.
The Entrance Examination of MBBS for ASHARAM Jodhpur has been launched in the first attempt.
Similarly, Anushka Panda, the Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, is suffering from a hereditary disease of Spinal Mascular Atrophy since birth.
All of them have done this thing that the whole world should continue to look after every hurdle that is being faced by their firm commitment and commitment.
If we look at the environment, we will see many such examples.
Any good event that happened in any part of the country, at the earliest, gives energy to my mind.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I looked at a news and wrote in it: "Two youngsters have fulfilled the dreams of Modi.
On reading the news, it was reported that how our youngsters use technologies in smart and creative ways and how to bring about changes in the lives of the common man.
The incident was that San Jose city of America was considered a hub of technology and once I was interacting with the Indian youth.
At that time, I urge them to think about how you can use your talent and talent for India and take some time and do something new.
I used to urge you to get the answer to the problem of brain-drain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, accepted my request and brought a new dream to the fore.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly created a Smart Gram App using their professional skills.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the whole world but also gets information and information through this app on your mobile.
The residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, village chief Sarpanchs, district officers and district officials have created awareness among the people to use this app.
You must say that this is a wonderful journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, On 23rd July this year, the festival of Vari is celebrated with fervor on the occasion of Akadash on 23rd July.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur districts of Maharashtra.
The serpents of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram are walking on foot in the direction of Pandharpur while playing salvation.
Tourists reach Pandharpur to visit Vithoba or Pandurang, which is also called Vithoba.
It is a god that protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged.
In the minds of the people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there is immense faith and devotion in Panduranga.
Let us go to the temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
Whether the medium of Bharud was used or disillusioned, the literature of these saints has given an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
The saints gave the mantra to empower the society to fight against blindness.
He also worked to eradicate the old misdeeds from the society, and the culture of compassion, equality and pursuit of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak was a sea like adventure and confidence.
The British tried their best to prove sedition three times in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the people of the country about a joyous event about Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
During that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad to welcome him and during his visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
During this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak were very impressed by their personality.
On August 1, 1920, Lokmanya Tilak died and after that Patel decided to build a memorial at Tilak in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the effigy of Tilak was made and Sardar Saheb inaugurated this memorial on 28 February, 1929, not by anyone else but by Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, one more thing is that this statue is very rare and Lokmanya Tilak is sitting on a chair, along with Tilak, he has written that the right to birth is the right of the king.
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of creating a sense of harmony and equality among the people along with traditional devotion and devotion.
In fact, there was a need to fight against the British in that specific period.
And the festivals launched by Tilaks used to work to unite everyone by breaking the walls of the society and by breaking the walls of the communities.
Since the popularity of organizing all these festivals in Ogha of the time has increased, it has been seen that even todays younger generation is very attractive to the heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today in many cities the pavilions of Ganesh Festival are seen in almost every street .
All the families in the street organise Ganapati Festival together.
Here also our youth get good opportunities, their leaders, festival organizers, programme organizers, coordinators can develop their qualities.
From the statue of Ganesh ji to the decorative jewellery, everything should be environmentally friendly.
Today, every Indian needs to have good governance and developmental results.
I speak about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad ji would take his life but he never bowed to foreign rule.
I am fortunate that this village of Chandrashekhar Azad is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I have got the opportunity to visit this village.
I also got the opportunity to pay homage to Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad and Chandrashekhar Azad had promised that even if he wanted to die by foreign pills, Chandrashekhar Azad would continue to fight for freedom and sacrifice for the last time, he would sacrifice only after independence.
This was their specialty.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, Hima Das, India's legendary daughter and daughter of a landlord, has won a new history by winning a gold medal in the 400-meter run-of-the-box Junior under-20 World Athletics winner in Finland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia as a reply to my letter and is now preparing the Ekta Asian Sports Competition.
It is written in our e-mail that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is the moment when the player holds the tricolor in his hand.
You are also proud of unity, we all are proud.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 won the Gold and Bronze Medals.
We should move ahead like this, keep playing and developing.
My dear countrymen, there have been several historic events in the month of August and various festivals also come this month, but sometimes during the rainy season, diseases occur at home.
Once again, I must visit the Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to interact with you once again through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
A few days ago, there was a historic meeting of Cricket in Bangalore.
You must have come to the notice of yourself. I talk about the cricket story between India and Afghanistan.
The two Unions showed great sports in this regard.
An Afghan Golandaz Rashid Khan had done a very good job in the IPL this year.
I thank our Indian friends for providing a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
I represent the best and best in Afghanistan.
This is a moment that we have experienced how the sportspersons are.
Sports is a very good medium to unite the society and showcase the skills and talent among our youth.
I extend my best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to play with each other and develop in the same way as our players.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, the fourth Yoga Day was a different view.
Be it the European Parliament, the United Nations, the headquarters of New York, or the ship fighting the Japanese Navy, people were seen doing yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme on Yoga and I got to know that this time women had guided many asanas.
In Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly performed yoga at the high altitude peaks.
We are working to connect everyone by breaking the boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from thousands of countries have celebrated Yoga Day by crossing the gaps like castes, religions, regions, colors or sex.
If people from all over the world were participating in the programmes of Yoga Day so enthusiasticly, then will his cake films in India not be encouraging
Yoga has been done in all the three places of our country's security forces, soldiers, soldiers, ships and civilians.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga on a pupil.
While some soldiers performed yoga on the snowy hills of Siachen.
The warriors of our Air Force were surprised by the warriors and by doing yoga in the sky at a height of 15 thousand feet from the ground.
It is important to say that he did not do yoga while sitting in the plane, but he did yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, yoga has been done all over the country.
Yoga has worked to unite people from all over the world by crossing castes, sects and geographical boundaries, and we have come to the world with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam since ancient times.
Our sages, Muni and saints have always stressed on this idea.
Today, Yoga has been proved by the means.
Today, I feel that wellness is working towards revolution.
We see Mother as a god, mother gives us birth, so we consider her as a god, this is our culture.
Sometimes doctors give us reproduction .
The role of doctors is not limited to medication only .
There is a good experience of the doctors not only have medical knowledge but also how they should have their lifestyle, how the impact of the system increases and how they have a good impact on their health.
Indian doctors have shown their infinite capabilities and skills and have created their own independent identity all over the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors cooperatives on the occasion of Dr.
India has a prosperous history.
The Kabiravad of Gujarat will be very comfortable to us and when I was in Gujarat, I used to work there, a large national session was being organised by the people of the tradition of Saint Kabir.
Everyone knows that in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Saint Kabir Das had taken a sacred place in the village of Magahar.
But is it a matter of surety that Kabir Das ji had chosen the place of Magahar for the sabbath
It was believed that those who died here in Magahar would not get a place in heaven.
On the contrary, those who sacrifice in Kashi go to heaven.
Magahar was considered an invisible place but Saint Kabir Das did not believe in such things at all.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and bondage through Sakhia and both.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from their creations.
The meaning of this is that whoever understands the suffering of others is true fakir and saints.
And those who don't know the sadness of others, they are certain.
Kabir Das ji had given special emphasis on social harmony.
He used to think about it in the past.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and they should be respected.
Even today, however, the words that Kabir said are as effective.
Today, when we read the words of Kabir ji, it seems that this is what we are talking about today's knowledge era.
We feel that their ideas are relevant even today.
Now we are talking about Saint Kabirdas ji, so I remember one of his two sisters.
There are such a great guru, Jagatguru-Guru Nanakdev.
He has shown the way to millions of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanakdev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is to serve God.
He worked for the welfare of the society wherever he went.
In such a kitchen, the people of any caste, religion and sect can come and eat food and Guru Nanak Dev started the way of 'Langar'.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanakdev ji will be celebrated in 2019.
The terrible settlement in Jallianwala Bagh will be completed in 2019, which would have been a brightness for the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always successful.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji's birth anniversary and in this programme, I am Dr.
During 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee had a very big contribution.
He was very excited and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Come on, we all are Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video conference.
It can be said that he has got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of people by crossing the files.
In the remote and remote villages, the youngsters are providing services through Common Service Centre till the pension of the elderly in the villages to make passports.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to gather cereals and make her ice cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates by going to nearby villages.
I am extremely happy to note that the success of the common man is more than the success of the government in this programme.
In such a disappointing environment, the hopes, new zeal and events happening in the lives of the common man cannot be credited to the government.
The incident of a small girl in a small village in the remote and far-flung areas also provides inspiration to 1.
With the help of technology, a moment spent with the beneficiaries through video bridge has also become very comfortable and inspirational.
In another way, living for the poorest of the poor gets new joy, new enthusiasm and inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in the video bridge programme and they worked to give me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to everyone for this.
On the one hand, there are professionals and technologies and on the other hand, our farmers working in the fields are brothers and sisters.
Now we are also thinking that agriculture and technologies are both different businesses and what is their relationship
The schemes were started and their successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to its marketing, the role of farmers is important and on the other hand efforts are being made to ensure the participation of the farmers.
Friends
This work that we have done in our youth is actually going to inspire the youth.
One National One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
If I have to give the highest credit to bring about a reform of One Nation, One Tax, then I will give it to the States.
GST Cooperative Federalism is an excellent example in which all the States have decided together for the benefit of the country and after that such a comprehensive tax reforms are possible in the country.
So far 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people from different political stakeholders come together.
Earlier, there were 17 different types of tax systems in the country, but now there has been a single tax system in the entire country.
GST is a victory of authenticity and it is also a festival of authenticity.
Earlier, there were many complaints about 'Inspectorraj' in tax matters.
GST may be the largest tax reform in the world.
Usually, it would have been a period of 5-7 years for such a large number of people to improve and stabilize the entire scheme.
The 21st National Sports Competition was organised in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
And when there is an environment, there is a resolution of zeal, zeal, zeal, hope, aspirations and aspirations.
This was a time when people from all over the country used to think that today some player is going to play.
How India's achievements, how many medals we win and all this was very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well in fulfilling the expectations of the people of the country and won one medal after one.
Whether it is a negotiator or a cotton, a weightlifting, a table tennis or a badminton India has done the best.
26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze - India has earned a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
Medal winners are a matter of pride and joy for every player.
This is a moment of pride for all the countries and for all the people of the country.
Perhaps my words will be less to express that feeling.
But I want to listen to you what I have heard from these players.
This was because there were many things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions.
He is the first Indian female sportsperson to win the first gold medal in the individual table tennis competition.
India got the highest medal in Nambaji.
The 15-year-old Indian neighbour, Anish Bhaw, became the youngest player in the national competition to win the Gold Medal.
Sachin Chaudhary, who won the medal in the Commonwealth Games, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
The sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were female players.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, nambaji, women sportspersons have performed well.
All were eager to fight and both the medals were available to India.
The sportspersons participating in the competition had come from different parts of the country, from small towns.
His friends have also contributed to those who have enhanced their mindset in every situation.
In Mann Ki Baat last month, I had invited the countrymen, especially our youth, to fit India and I had invited everybody.
Participate in Fit India, represent the Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are joining it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have shown their support by writing letters and sending letters and showcasing their health mantras on social media.
A household student, Bhosle, while showing his shadows in the waterfall pond, wrote: My dream is my body, my delegation is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, I feel happy and healthy with Morning Walk.
And they further say - for me-fitness programs with a slide and we should slide, when we are helpful.
There is no doubt that Devnath ji is healthy in happiness.
Dhawal Prajapati, while sharing his photographs of the mountaineering, wrote, "This is a fit India for me.
I am very happy to see that many famous people are encouraging their youth for a fit India in an extremely attractive manner.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Moreover, many youngsters have shared their experiences in fit India.
I feel that such movements are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
I must say one more thing - Yoga is the name of the Fit India movement without spending any money.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been achieved by the entire world.
You will also get ready from now on.
Not alone - Your city, your village, your department, your school, your college, every person should try to participate in any age or male or female.
Today I want to talk to you to invite you for a new work and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to join a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
Students from colleges, NCC youths, NSS youths, youth from Nehru Yuva Kendra, who want to participate in making changes in society.
With a positive energy, it is an opportunity for all of them to do something in the society and it will also strengthen cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will get the pleasure of doing something before that and I also tell you that those best trainees who have done good work in the colleges and have done it in the universities.
Moreover, the UGC will also give two credit points to those trainees who will complete this.
I once again invite students, students and youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will surely succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these vacations as an opportunity to experience a new experience.
This group of youth has started a big campaign for the education of children living in roads and slums.
Initially, the situation of children who were asking for money on the roads or those who were doing small and big jobs left them so much that they were completely bored in this work.
The Mission, which started from 15 children from the nearby slums of Gita Colony, Delhi, has now reached 2,000 children from 12 locations in the capital.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign have participated in this Bhagirath effort to make social changes by taking two hours from their busy routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the hilly region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their fate but also their fate.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, mainly Mandwa, square peas or jaw cooking is taken.
What did they do - they started making biscuits from these crops in the field and they started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative organization in Munnar village and the factory has been opened to create biscuits there.
Keeping in mind the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual increase of the institute has not only reached 10-15 lakh rupees but more than 900 households have also reduced the migration from the district.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there will be war for water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks this thing but isn't there any responsibility
Did we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should have the responsibility.
Over centuries, our ancestors have shown this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, maybe they may have written a large number of inscriptions in some temples in Tamil Nadu regarding irrigation, water conservation and evil management.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will be seen all over the world.
Even today, different foreigners are popular as tourist destinations but we do not forget that these are also a living prize for the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
The queen of Adlaj and Patan in Gujarat is the world heritage of UNESCO and its magnificence is worth seeing.
There are only water temples in this way .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to see the moonlight in Jodhpur .
This is Indias largest and well-known heritage and the most important thing is that there is a lack of water in the region.
The period of April, May, June, July is when there is a better chance of accumulating rain water and if we are prepared earlier, we will get so much benefit.
MNREGA funds are also used in the work of water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has tried its own way towards water conservation and water conservation.
Every year more than Rs. 32 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation and water management in addition to MNREGA fund.
If we talk about 2017-18, 55 of the total expenditure of 64 thousand crore has been spent for work like water conservation, about 35 thousand crore rupees.
In the last three years, approximately 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted by such water conservation and water conservation measures.
Under MNREGA, the district administration has taken over the responsibility of land and water conservation.
With the help of about 40 to 45 villages, Sasur Khadri has revived these dried rivers.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again we are in front of us in April, May, June, July, we should take some responsibility for water conservation and water conservation, we should also make some plans and we will also show some things.
When Mann Ki Baat happens, I get messages from all sides, letters come and phones come.
IN Kumar Banerjee, in Devitola village of North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many do not know the philosophy of living with quiet, beautiful and prosperousness of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.
Please discuss this in the Mann Ki Baat programme, that is, people will get information about this.
I am grateful to INGI for attracting the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was an individual full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings have put an end to everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he was a teacher every moment.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on radio in the morning and when Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmani used to get the opportunity to listen to this poem.
You must have depicted Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The holy month of Ramadan will start in a few days.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The collective purpose of daily routine is that when a person is hungry himself then he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Prophet Mohammed.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophet - What is the best work in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Giving food to the poor and the needy and considering each one of them, whether you know them or not.
Mohammed, who was sent, believed in knowledge and compassion.
They had no ego of anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Mohammad, who was sent, believed that no person was not because of this wealth but because of his holy soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must feel proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, which shows the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, which guided millions of people across the world.
This Buddha Poornima recalls the responsibility of following the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values that are most essential in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that his social philosophy is a great inspiration for Lord Buddha.
"Babasaheb has empowered millions of people, be it oppressed, exploited, deprived.
It cannot be a big example of doing this.
To understand the sadness of the people, compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks had travelled in different countries, they used to take the rich ideas of Lord Buddha with them and always used to happen.
In Asia, there is a legacy of teaching Lord Buddha.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings have been deepened and this is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism so that the important Buddhist destinations in Southeast Asia are connected to Indias important Buddhist destinations.
I am glad that the Government of India is a partner in revival of several Buddhist temples, including the beautiful Anand Mandir of Baghan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, all over the world, conflicts and human sufferings are seen, and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to fulfil the vision.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and faith in Lord Buddha all over the world.
For the entire world, I bless Lord Buddha so that we can fulfill our responsibility of creating a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is a belief that Lafing Buddha brings good fortune, but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important phenomenon in Indias conservation history.
Now you are wondering what is the relationship between Smyling Buddha and India's military power
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
Atomic tests were conducted on 11 May 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
20 years are being completed and this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias test was successful and thus India showed its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked in the history of India as its military strength.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that internal power is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we become strong as a country, we are in a peaceful way with each other.
This month is not only important for the country, but also the way these tests have been done.
It showed the world that India's land is a land of great scientists and India can achieve new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 11th May, 1998, every young man should contribute to the creation of a strong India and a strong India by introducing the mantra of Jai Vigyan for the strength of India.
Make your strength part of India's strength.
We can also get a new joy and a new solution to the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, let us visit the next Mann Ki Baat programme.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavami .
A few days ago, when all the leaders of the ASEAN nation came here on 26th January, the artists of that country had also come here with them.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of their countries presented Ramayana to us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana are not only effective and inspiring in India but also in the ASEAN nations on this land of the world.
I once again convey my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, I have always received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and responses from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about the launch of Sanskrit online section on My-Gov.
I read the response written by Shri Yut Dhanshyam Kumar ji of Barkar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed about the declining waters of the earth is surely very important.
Shri Yut Shakal Shastri ji of Karnataka used the words very brightly and wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman land is there.
Shri Yuth Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said that I should talk about the health of the youth this time.
According to him, if we compare to other Asian countries then Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that this time I will talk to everyone in detail about health - Strong India.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented all the photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi App.
Now you bring those photos and retweet them and reach your friends.
The ideas that ANGHA, Jayesh and many other children have written behind the book 'Exam Warrior' in their minds.
Anga, Jayesh and all other children, I would like to tell you all that these letters leave my whole day's tiredness.
I got the opportunity to hear all these letters, phone calls, reactions and all these things that I can read.
Today, even though I have decided to tell the same thing, I will have to tell it continuously for months.
This time more and more letters have been sent by the children, they are inscribed for the examination.
Your plans have been told me in the holidays.
In summers animals and birds do not get water , they are worried about it .
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers' fairs and the things that are happening in the country.
Some awakening citizens have suggested measures on water conservation.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio with each other, I am feeling a way that in the summer, more and more letters come on the topics related to summer.
Pre-examination, the students are eligible for examination care.
That is, things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things in our minds also change the weather in someone else's life and why not change
When I get to read in your letters, how Ahmed Ali, the Inspector of Karimganj, Assam, has built nine schools for the poor at the rapid pace of his will, then I see the incomparable will power of our country.
When I got to hear about Dr. Atal Mohan Chaudhari of Kanpur, he goes on footpath and gives food to the poor and also provides free medicines then I get the opportunity to feel the bonds of the country.
Several passengers travelling through their cabs helped a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
This way, after 12 years of collection of money, the efforts of the last Sadul Laskar were successful.
Today, due to his determination and his hard work, he has built nearly 30 beds of sickness in Punri village near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of the entire world to look at India has changed.
Today, when India's name is taken with great pride, then after that, the sons and daughters of Mother India are hiding.
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence has been created.
This self-confidence, this positiveness and our commitment to New India will be fulfilled.
My dear countrymen, for the next few months, our farmer brothers and sisters are very important.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Scientific, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charansingh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them considered the farmers and the farmers as an integral part of the economy of the country and the universal life.
In addition, Lal Bahadur Shastri also stressed on the protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhari Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies, innovations and their needs.
This state, which has a very low area, has done a big job.
The farmers of Meghalaya have produced record during 2015-16 as compared to the previous five years.
He has proved that whenever the goals are certain, the determinations are determined, the will to fulfil it, they can be fulfilled by their experiences.
Brothers and sisters, An important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get the right price in the budget here.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be given at least one and a half times the cost of their production.
It is said in detail that if the cost of production is taken into consideration for sustainability, the wages of the farmers, the wages of the livestock and the cost of the animals, the cost of all kinds of fertilizers, the cost of the seeds, the cost of the fertilizers, the cost of the fertilizer given to the state government, the wages given to the capital, the rent of the farms, the rent of the farm and not only will the cost of production be added to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving agriculture and farming across the country is also going on in a broad way to ensure that the crops of farmers get the right market.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the village, grassroots markets and then the global markets come together.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far to sell their goods, they are being modernized by providing the infrastructure required for 22 thousand rural markets in the country and then they will be linked to the agricultural income market committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year, the celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will begin.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can we gather 1. 25 billion people together and pay the best tribute to Gandhiji
What should be the logo of Gandhi 150
Together, let us pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and take inspiration from Bapu and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with traditional approach in the field of health.
It was believed that the Ministry of Health had already been responsible for all the health related work in the country.
However, now all the Ministries and Departments, be it the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easy solution .
Therefore, as much as we are aware of health care, people, families and society will get more benefits.
Besides, work is going on in a comprehensive way towards setting up of healthcare centres across the country.
Yoga has made its new identity worldwide in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga.
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home due to the commitment of all of us to Yoga.
This year's International Day of Yoga is another 100 days on 21st June.
In the last three years, people from all over the country and the world participated in the event of every International Day of Yoga with great enthusiasm.
This year also, let us ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire our entire family, friends and others to do yoga.
In a new and attractive way, we have to work towards reaching Yoga to children, youth and senior citizens and to make it more popular by reaching every age group of women and men.
However, the mobile and electronic media of the country continues to conduct various programmes for Yoga throughout the year.
But can some programmes to create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher, but Yoga is definitely a practicer.
However, some people have made me Yoga teachers by using their imagination and have made three-dimensional animated videos of my yoga.
I will reach this video to all of you that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Today, more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable rates.
The work of starting more new centres is also going on.
I urge the stories of Mann Ki Baat to reach out to the needy people, that is, the cost of their medicines will be very low, they will have a lot of service.
The cost of the stent required for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The cost of instruments used for knee transplantation has been reduced by 50 to 70 percent by controlling .
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households, about 50 crore citizens will be provided together to the Government of India and insurance companies in a year.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 Medical Colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
We aim to make the entire country tuberculosis free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
There is a need to create awareness for every individual and you need help for that.
To get rid of tuberculosis we all have to come together and try .
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He believed that industries could also provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today the Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a scenario, Dr. Ambedkars dream of becoming an industrial power is inspiring us.
Today, India has come to the forefront of the world's economy and the world's largest FDI is going on in India today.
The whole world is looking at India as the centre of investment, research and development.
He further said that today, the Smart City Mission and Urban Mission have been launched to provide facilities like good roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
Nobody was convinced that he should live in poverty.
At the same time, he believed that the poor would not be able to overcome their poverty by providing some thermal facilities.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India are being undertaken by young researchers and entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen the Jal Shakti as the nations strength.
Babasaheb had the vision of establishing several river valleys and water related commissions.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing on different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
In the forty decades, the main issues of discussion were the second war, cold war and destruction.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of the Union Territory and stressed the need to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federal system and competitive cooperative federal system in every department of the government.
And the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is the inspiration of crores of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in Shrimant or the prestigious family to move forward in life, but in India, even those who are born in poor families, can try to fulfil and succeed in it.
Many people attacked Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor and to the backward classes.
The Gram-Swarajya Abhiyan will be organised from 14th April to 5th May, 2018 on the birth anniversary of Dr.
It will have different programmes on rural development, poverty welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in larger numbers.
My dear countrymen, many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming in the coming days.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance .
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Easter said that Lord Jesus recalls the inspirational teachings that he gave the message of peace, goodwill, justice, compassion and compassion to mankind.
In April, the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India.
Thank you very much
We are the first to see the color of the sea blue but in everyday life we feel that water is colorless and it does not have color.
Whether it is the river or the sea or the water of it is colorful, can we ever think about it
This question came in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
With this question, a great scientist of modern India emerged.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for the excellent work of light scattering.
Their research is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
On 28th February, Raman was considered to have discovered light skating and we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day and received the Nobel Prize for research.
These countries have given many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand there is tradition of great mathematicians Bodhyan , Bhaskar , Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta while on the other hand Susrat and Charak are our pride in health treatment .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana are proud of India.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose is also known as the famous boson particle.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme of Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Mumbai.
It was heartening to know about the miracles in the field of science.
Through artificial intellect, Robo and specific working machines are helped.
Nowadays machines are sporting their intellect by self-reliance.
This technology can be used to ease the lives of poor, deprived and needy.
In this programme of artificial intelligence, I used to urge the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to ease the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Can we imagine natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad in Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There a young man had developed such a digital device that he couldn't speak, he wrote that his voice was transformed and we could also interact with this person as we speak to a person.
I think we can use artificial intelligence in many such places.
The machine works as per its wishes.
But what we want to do through the machine depends on us.
Here human purposes are important, the use of science for human welfare and the use of science for achieving the highest height of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who laid the foundation of the light of the light, has often failed in many of his experiments.
Asked about this, he said that I have discovered ten thousand ways to make the light of the light, that is, Edison made his own strength.
Today, with Yoga, I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he gave a challenge to the British government, fought against him and asked for a responsibilities for his rule.
As a great sage, he presented questions about every aspect of life.
Its answer showed the way to humanity.
The spirit of asking questions is often important to know the truth.
This is also a true inspiration behind scientific research .
We should not be healthy until we get the answers to these questions.
I congratulate all those associated with our scientific and scientific sector on National Science Day.
I extend my best wishes to our younger generations for the discovery of truth and knowledge and to inspire society to serve with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of grievances, during the crisis, security and disaster. People are writing something or the other.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written about professional security in his response from Pune.
He writes that the quality of safety in factories and constructions in our country is not as good.
On March 4, Indias National Security Day, the Prime Minister should take up the subject of security in our mindset, which will increase the awareness of security among the people.
When we are talking about public security, two things are important, preparedness and preparedness.
Safety is of two types , one which is necessary during disaster and the other is essential in daily life .
We are not aware of safety in everyday life, but it is difficult to secure safety during the disaster.
Beware, if we follow the required rules then we can protect our lives and save our society from a major accident.
We see that many things have been written on the safety of the workplace but they do not seem to be following it.
The municipalities and municipal corporations who have a velocity of adjoining trains have to go to a separate school in a week or a month and make a mock drill before the students.
It will have two advantages, the fire brigade will also have the habit of being aware and the new generation will also get education in this regard and there will be no need to spend differently, in a way it becomes a part of education and that is why I have always been proud.
If we talk about disasters and disasters, India is geographically embarrassed.
This country has caused some natural, man-made, disasters and chemicals and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management of the country.
The NDMA runs quickly in dangers such as earthquake, floods, floods and landslides.
Training and awareness have an important role.
Two-three years ago thousands of people had to lose their lives every year in the light of heat, then NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness and workshops in this regard.
This shows that if we give preference to security then we can get protection.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces, the National Disaster Response Forces, the Armed Forces, dont sacrifice their lives during the crisis.
NCC and scouts also help in this work, training.
This was the first and wide effort of the joint disaster management exercise of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Nepal.
These values should be an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in the budget of this time, the emphasis has been laid on creating energy from waste to wealth and waste for the village under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The programme has been launched and has been named as Gobar Dhan, which has been called Gallehnaizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from liquid and biological residue, but it is not used in India with full potential.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are moving towards this direction.
Animal husbandry, waste in the farm and waste in the kitchen have been aimed at utilizing all of them for the production of biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers of rural India will be encouraged by the brothers and sisters that they should not only look at the waste and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in cleaning the villages.
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will be helpful in increasing income.
It will increase employment opportunities by collecting waste, transportation and selling of biogas.
A online platform will be set up to facilitate proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect farmers to the consumers and give them a fair price for the sugarcane and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India, to take the initiative, to create a Self Help Group and to create a cooperative committee and take advantage of this opportunity.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement for clean energy and green employment, to transform the waste of our villages into wealth and to transform the money of the bee.
Different artworks were created using waste.
Working schools were organised to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everybody had imaginative ideas about cleanliness, discussed and presented poems.
There was a festive atmosphere for cleanliness.
In particular, school students participated in the exercise.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration for the innovative way that this festival was celebrated for waste management and cleanliness.
Every year 8th March is celebrated as International Womens Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and in the world.
Women working in different fields are honoured on this day.
Today, the country is moving forward towards women development, under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I recall Swami Vivekananda's thoughts, he said, Adarsh Nari hypothesis is complete freedom.
125 years ago, Swamiji's ideas reflect on women's strength in Indian culture.
Today, it is the duty of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are a part of the tradition where women are recognized by men, a son of success, a skilled son, a son of Gandhi.
Women are empowered, strong and are equal partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me that on 8th March there are several programmes on Womens Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Egyptians.
You can imagine such a big event.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that the women's strength is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into a habit of public opinion.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I had reached Elephanta Island in three villages after 70 years of independence.
You know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
In Elephant for 70 years, the life of the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sett ports in three villages had spread darkness in their lives.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and people there.
I am glad that Elephant village and caves are now shining .
This is not just a electricity but a new start.
What can be a matter of greater joy than the lives of the countrymen and their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, now we have celebrated the festival of Mahashivratri.
The specialty of the month of March is the blossoming blossom of the crops of the month of March and the blossoming blossom.
We love this month for Holi celebrations.
On March 2, Holi will be celebrated with enthusiasm all over the country.
Holi has the importance of colour as well as Holika Dahan has the importance of diagnosing the ill effects.
May this festival be happy in the lives of our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
In 2018, I first interact with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the Chief Guests of 10 countries, the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing fast in every field in India, moving ahead and raising the country's supremacy.
The pride given to the women of our country, their place in society and their contributions are very big and innovative in terms of the entire world.
India has a great tradition of great demons.
Several Indian scholars have played an important role in the creation of Vedas.
I don't know how many names can be taken like Lopamudra, Gargi and friends.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and our family in the threshold of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, a great scholar like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or a saint of the devotional path, or a dictator like Ahilyabai Hollywood, or a brave rangini like Rani Lakshmibai, women's strength is always inspiring us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his address.
He added that our brave defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, is inspiring the journey from the fighter aircraft Sukhoi-30.
These three brave women have become aeronautical fighting, Mohana Singh and Avni Chaturvedi, who are now training in Sukhoi-30.
Just a few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met a group of women who performed such extraordinary work for the first time in their fields.
Our women's strength has done extraordinary work to break the chains of the tradition of society and established a new record.
He demonstrated that hard work, tireless efforts and if the resolve is strong then however troubles and obstacles have arisen, they can cross them and create a new path from across.
Now this path is not only inspiring our contemporary people, but also inspires generations to come.
The book Narendra Modi Website is available in the form of e-book.
Today, in the positive changes in the country and society, the women's strength has played a very important role in this country.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station here.
Now we must have come to our minds that there is a good relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga railway station in Mumbai.
There are women workers in all the departments at this station.
After observing the routine of the Republic Day, many people wrote on the streets and other social media that all women were participating in the BSF Byeker Continent.
These women were experiencing adventurous experiments and they also surprised the visitors from abroad.
Both words of empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
However, these tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture before the country.
The complex of Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere here on the strength of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such dangerous areas, tribal women are becoming self-sufficient by running e-rickshaws.
The introduction of any society, whether it has developed a system of reforms or not.
Continuous efforts are being made in our country against social misdeeds and evil practices and practices.
Just a few days ago, a good effort was made in Bihar.
More than 13 thousand kilometres of human reservoirs were built in the state to completely eradicate social mischief, which was the longest human reservoir in the world.
In this campaign, people have created awareness in society against bad practices such as child marriage, punctuality.
The entire state has decided to fight against evils like Hooda and Balavivah.
Youngsters, mothers and sisters all participated in this campaign.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human range was linked to the border of the state.
All the people of the society need to get the benefits of development in the real sense, so that our society is free from such misdeeds.
Let us pledge to destroy all these misdeeds and create a New India, a strong and empowered India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration there and every person participating in the humanity.
But after getting information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he has started buying medicines from there and now his father's cost has decreased by 75 percent.
This helps the people, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday.
Generic medicines purchased in these are similar to the standards set by the World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines can be provided at affordable rates.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing cheap medicines but also creating new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
The only objective of all these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the country and to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Yut Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
I would like to look at the differentiation of this photograph.
In this photograph, a bride had joined the Clean Morana River with her miracles.
I got to know that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the Morana River in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more painful thing is that the wild grass and waterfalls were bursting in the river's character.
A large number of wastes and wastes were also being thrown on the river and its banks.
On 13 January, a day before Makar Sankranti, the Swachh Morana Mission was prepared by the villagers, accordingly, in the first phase, the two coasts of the Morana river were cleaned in four kms.
I have come to know that Akolekar will continue this campaign every Saturday morning till the Morana river is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then it is impossible, it is not at all.
Through the Jan Andolan, it can bring about a transformation in the mass movement.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of discussion about the Padma awards at present. You must have heard that too.
There is a tradition of giving Padma Awards every year, but for the last three years the entire process of this award has been changed.
Any citizen can now refer to this award.
This entire process has become transparent due to online.
Now the importance of the person's work is being taken into consideration and introducing him to give the awards.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know about the work of Arvind Gupta ji.
Aurobindo ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has lived his life in creating sports for small children.
He is constantly trying to know about the scientific experiments that the children should use in the use of waste and discounted things.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showed the pictures made in 18 different languages and inspired the children.
This is the same thing as Sitava Joddi of Karnataka.
He was not being called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, Sitava has played a major role in transforming the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
In the seventh year of age, he used to dedicate himself as a deity, but Sitavas spent their entire life for the welfare of the deities.
Not only this, he has also done great work for the welfare of the Dalit women.
We must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor and tribal family.
He used to do a simple job, but he liked to do traditional tribal paintings and paintings.
This verse has given him honour not only in India but in the whole world.
In many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy, their paintings have been displayed.
He has been awarded Padmashree Awards by recognising the talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who sings the name of India abroad.
He has made more than five hundred medicines based on our memories.
He has been awarded the Padmashree Award as the honour of his social work by exploring and discovering these fameless persons.
I am keen to mention another name here today, the 75-year-old Subhashini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Award.
Subhasini Mistry had rubbed the pots in the houses of others to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
He was inspired by this crisis in life to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospital built by their untiring hard work.
The Padma Award is a medium and I would like to tell the people of the country that there are lakhs of people working around us, living for society, dedicating their lives, working with some special goals and sometimes bringing them to the society.
Such people do not work for dignity at all.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas every year on 9th January.
The revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we have an unprecedented bond in India and all over the world, as if we are celebrating the festival.
We will be happy to know that this programme was attended by Mayor of Indian origin from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America and many other countries.
I would like to thank the European Union for making a remarkable work, creating the identity of the original Indian dynasty and providing this information to the people of the world through vision.
Those who have shown us a new path, on 30th January, the day of the revered Bapu ji is the death anniversary.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, whether India or the world, person or family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last anniversary of Mann Ki Baat and today is the last day of the year 2017.
Throughout the year, we have spoken on a number of things together and have done a lot of things.
Innumerable journals, reactions and exchange of ideas for Mann Ki Baat, all this would always give me a new energy.
This year is going to change in a few hours, but our conversations and dialogues will continue.
In the coming years, we are going to talk about new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, Christmas Celebrations were celebrated with great enthusiasm all over the world.
We also see the feelings of service in the bible.
The Sun of Man Haj Low, Not to B Sarvah, But to Sarvah, And to Guivah Hiz Life, Az Blastingtu All Humankind.
In these words, what is the importance and greatness of the service
Whatever happens in this world, be it religion, tradition or character, but the invaluable form of humanity is introduced by the service.
We were talking about the expulsion work in our country, the expulsion work was not expected, the service was done.
It was also said that we have served Paramo Dharma.
Live-service is Shiva Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans have said that live-service should be done with a sense of harmony.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Abnormal life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's bravery and sacrifice is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave the teachings of great life-styles and he lived on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji used to inspire people in all such roles as a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustice.
He taught people to give up the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these endeavours, he was able to afford a lot at a personal level.
However, he has never finished the feeling of anger in his mind.
Every minute in his life, he continued to convey the message of love, sacrifice and peace.
This shows how great and special their personality was.
I am fortunate to be participating in the light festival organized by Guru Gobind Singh ji on the 350th birth anniversary of Patna Sahib.
1 January, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that a new year has come every year and January is coming every year.
But when I say that 'specific' then it is really special.
And I urge all of you to register your names as a voter.
The entire India is keen to welcome its 21st century voter.
As a voter in the 21st century, we would have been feeling respected.
Our belief is the foundation of a New India.
This is the biggest strength of democracy.
Death is the most effective way to bring about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
We just have the right to vote.
What should be our dreams in the 21st century India
You will also be the maker of India in the 21st century and it will be started from January 1.
I am sure that our dream of a New India will be fulfilled on the thrust of the skills of this vibrant youth.
When we talk about New India, this New India should be free from poisons such as casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from dirt and poverty.
In New India, peace, unity and harmony should be our guiding power.
Let the youth of New India come forward and think about how a New India should be.
They should also set a path for us and a large group of those connected to it will be formed.
If we continue to move forward then the country will move forward.
Now, while interacting with you, there was a thought in my mind that can we organise a mock parliament in every district of India
Can the youth of the age group of 18 to 25 years come together to discuss the issue of New India and find out various ways and plans
How can we achieve our resolve before 2022
What can we do to build India in the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi became a mass movement for the freedom movement.
My young friends, today is the need of the hour that we should also create a mass movement for a grand and grand India in the 21st century.
Today there are innumerable new opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are moving forward and successfully.
I believe that an independent strong system should be created by considering the way the youth of New India can get information about all these schemes at one place.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last time, I used to tell you about the importance of cooperatives.
Whatever work is easier for those who have positive and enthusiasm is possible.
People in English say, "Passimimism Lids to Weekness, Optimism to Power", I had been calling upon the countrymen to showcase the positive moments that we have experienced in 2017 and welcome them in such positive environment in 2018.
People have given a large number of positive responses on social media, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and have shown their experiences.
Some people have done some special work in their personal life.

There was a very serious problem of water in our area and for the last 40 years we were dependent on the waterways of Aarmi.
Now we have become free waterways.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy of getting such small things, let us take decisive and determined steps to move from the start of the New Year towards 'Pragati Bharat'.
Now we are talking about positiveness, so I am also keen to tell you one thing here.
Recently, I am going to boost the information about Anjum Bashir Khan Khattar, who has won the highest rank in the Administrative Services Examination in Kashmir.
This was the first time in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination, out of the atmosphere of terrorism and adversity.
He wrote the story of success in his own hands.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration not only for Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Whatever the situation may be bad, it has proved to be a confusion of disappointment through positive action.
Recently, in the last week, I got the opportunity to meet some of the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
I used to know about the desires that were in them, the enthusiasm that were in them.
He used to say that in which field of life he wanted to progress, in which field he had a lot of hope in his mind.
While talking to them, I feel that there is no disappointment between them.
They had enthusiasm, joy, joy, energy, great dreams and resolves.
I also got a lot of inspiration from them during the time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youth and this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world, it is natural to know about the temples of Sabarimala in Kerala.
Thousands of devotees come every year to bless Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
Nobody is big in this campaign, no one is small.
Every traveller considers a part of the worship of God and works for cleanliness.
No matter how big a celebrity it is, no matter how rich it is, no matter how rich it is, no matter how large it is, everybody is working as a normal traveller.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong resolution of cleanliness along with hard work.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October, 2014, on the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu, all of you have resolved to make a Swachh Bharat, Swachh Bharat free India.
Efforts are being made in a wide range across the country towards cleanliness.
People's participation in rural areas and urban areas is also changing now.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to see how cleanliness level in urban areas is being achieved.
This survey will be done in more than four thousand cities and about 40 crore people in the country.
It is going to examine whether there is an open defecation free in the cities, or not the system of transportation of garbage, scientific waste management or not, the efforts to change the habits of the people, the participation of the people in this work, the efforts to create capacity and the use of some innovations for cleanliness.
During this survey, different types of cities will be tested.
He will also interact with the citizens and understand their responses.
How is the use of the Swachhata App and analysis to improve various services
It is not just the government to keep cleanliness.
However, every civilian and civilian organisation has a big responsibility in maintaining cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to join the Swachhata Survekshan in large numbers.
And don't ask for the cleanliness of the city, don't follow your streets, your society.
I am sure you must have taken the habit of classification of dry wastes and wet wastes in Gharam, and you would have been using blue and green waste while putting waste.
The theory of Reduce, Reuse and Recycles is very effective for the garbage.
If the population of our city is more than one lakh, if there are more than one lakh population and less than one lakh population then it should be our dream to achieve the highest number of sectoral ranks.
And we should also make efforts.
And all of us should have the dream of 'Our City- Our Efforts' and 'Our PRAGATI'.
Let us conclude with such a resolution and recall the revered Bapus efforts to fulfil the resolve of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but if we look at it as a society then we become our identity.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to share one such thing with you.
I understand that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go only to Maharam or her men.
Specially, the rules are not in Islamic countries.
However, only Muslim women in India did not get this right.
And I am very happy to submit here that our government has taken care of this thing.
I am confident and I firmly believe that the journey of development of India will continue to move forward on the strength of our women and their talent.
And that is why our women should also get equal rights and equal opportunities along with men and we should continue our efforts and we need to move forward on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for us.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered specially.
This year, the Democratic Day celebrations will be attended by leaders of all the ten ASEAN countries as leading guests.
This year, on the day of Republic Day, there will be ten major guests.
The year 2017 was special to both ASEANs country and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and in 2017, the 25th year of Indias partnership with ASEAN was completed.
It is a matter of pride for all our Indians to join these great leaders from 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, the days of festivals are going on and we see that our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps no such day can be said that no festival is celebrated on that day.
Let us take a lot of joy, happiness and prosperity to all of us in the coming New Year.
We all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new joy and new resolves.
This month Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in January and this festival is connected to nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankrant says, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals have a special significance.
All these festivals are generally celebrated during 13th to 17th January.
Thank you very much, my dear countrymen.
Now we are going to say this again in 2018.
The Indian citizens will not be able to find any respect for them.
The age is far greater than all of us and they are witnesses of different phases of the country.
I got the privilege of interacting with Didi before my departure to foreign countries.
This was a lovely conversation between us and our elder sisters in a small sense.
I don't really speak much about such a personal interaction.
Listen, even on this trend of life, Latadi is eager for everything related to the country.
The feeling of satisfaction in his life is connected to Indias progress, transforming India, and is connected to India that is attaining new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I used to travel on a plane.
Lata ji: Good, good.
What to celebrate on Good Day
And the achievement that we have achieved has been achieved through the medium of instruments and penance.
I really have nothing.
Lata ji: Yes.
Your letters will also be available to me and I will also be able to get your visits.
I don't want to give you much trouble because I am imagining how much you work and how much you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: But I will be here soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks.
Your houses will be filled with joy.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
The darkness under the direction is only called.
Most of these words are not just words, but it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Whenever you come to our houses, whenever you come out with sweets, clothes and visits then you should think about this visit for a minute.
At least the things that are more than required in our houses, which we don't use now, must be given to the needy outside.
In many cities, many such institutions work with start-ups of young colleagues.
They collect clothes, grains and food from the houses of the people and find out the needy and reach them.
Laughing at the faces of many poor families will double the joy of the festival, the brightness of our faces, our lights will be brighter and their brightness will brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi comes home as a luck and prosperity in Diwali and is welcomed in traditional form.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this year
In our culture, girls have been treated as Lakshmi because girls bring good fortunes and prosperity.
Can we organise programmes for the honour of girls in our society, villages and cities this year
Can we commemorate this festival of Laxmi in Diwali this year
You must have heard a lot of girls around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Somebody is working to teach poor children, somebody is working to create awareness about cleanliness and health, somebody is working to serve the society by becoming a doctor or engineer, somebody is trying to justify someone.
Our society should recognize, honour and honour such people.
The programme of such honors should be organized across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Show more information about the success of these girls through social media and use Bharat Ki Laxmi Hashtag.
We had launched the 'Selfie with Dugter' programme and it had spread all over the world. Similarly, we should also celebrate India's Laxmi.
Encouraging India's Laxmi initiative means empowering the country and the country's prosperity.
My dear countrymen, I had said that the Mann Ki Baat programme has a great advantage that I have the opportunity to interact directly or indirectly with many familiar persons.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayang, has sent me a chain paper and he has written in it that I read that letter before you...
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
When this year, when my exam came to an end, some people asked me if you read the book Exam Warriors
I told them that I have not read this book.
But I went back and bought this book and read it two-three times.
After that my experience was very good.
If I had read this book before exams, I would have benefitted from it.
I feel that if you are thinking about the new spirit of this book, then you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some other workers.
Thank you very much for reading and reading the books of Exam Warriors two-three times.
My younger friend has also instructed me to do something.
I will certainly follow our instructions.
When this book comes in a new dimension, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
But will I urge you all to help me all this work
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our younger friend, student Alina Tayang of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also discussing the programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through telephone.
But you are aware that I am also a common man like you, a common man and that is why the impact on a common life continues to affect me and my mind because I am also one of you.
Then I also listened to the speech and saw the confrontation.
He was defeated by Rafael Nadal, Emperor of the Tennis World, who had played the Grand Slam at 19 times just a short while ago.
The visitors were excited to speak to him.
He also complimented the donor winner Nadal for inspiring millions of youth to play tennis.
Even after being defeated by recent times, he lauded his rival Nadal and placed an excellent example of sports activity in the world.
While on the other hand, the winner Nadal also complimented the donor's game with his heart.
It has a lot to learn from every section and every age group.
These are moments that are beyond winning or losing, when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The ideas of our ancestors were indeed commendable.
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janyati Loksya Lochan Andham i. e.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is really going to tell you for your good.
The debates will continue, the differences between the parties will continue, but if some things stop at the earliest, then it will be of great benefit.
The things that grow at a rapid pace, it becomes difficult to stop these things.
But if we first get awakened and stop it then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel today, especially with my dear youth.
You all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for the health and it becomes very difficult to leave the intoxication .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By its consumption in adolescents there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I want to talk to you about a new topic.
You must be aware that recently an e-cigarette ban was imposed in India.
E cigarette is such an electronic instrument which is different from regular cigarettes .
In cigarettes because of nicotine liquid substances being hot a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
You might be aware of the danger of cigarettes often, but there has been an irregularity about e-cigarettes that e-cigarettes does not cause any threat.
Aromatic chemicals are used in this for not spreading its odour like other cigarettes .
We have seen around us that many households have chemicals but still they prevent others from smoking and stopping them from smoking.
The subject of e-cigarettes is different.
If someone smokes around us then he understands us only from his dwelling .
If there is a cigarette packet in someone 's treasure then also he understands only from the air .
However, e-cigarette is not a matter of fact that many youngsters and youngsters are ignorant and sometimes fashioned as fashion stemming, they are seen roaming e-cigarettes in our books, our grandsons, and sometimes in their fashion and then intoxicated.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
Cigarettes have been tied to ensure that this kind of addiction does not affect our youth.
These restrictions have been imposed so that the lives of children do not apply to the country and do not spread their hands and feet in society by addiction.
I urge you all to quit this intoxication and do not commit any injustice to e-cigarette.
Let us together build a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that at two o'clock in the morning and evening we will go to the gym.
For fit India one has to stay away from all these addictions .
My dear brothers and sisters, It is indeed a matter of privilege for us that our country has been the birthplace and workplace of many people who spend their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such extraordinary people, workplace and these are people who have sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is surely a matter of pride for every Indian that the Pope will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on 13th October.
The work done by Sister Mary Thresia for the welfare of humanity in just fifty years of his life is a unique example for the whole world.
He was very close to the social service and education sector.
He set up several schools, habitats and orphanages.
He established the Congression of the Sisters of the Holy Family which is still fulfilling their livelihoods and aims.
I once again pay homage to Sister Mary Thracea and convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian people, especially to our Christian brothers and sisters.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of the countries around the world have been enforcing India in the direction of environmental conservation.
I am confident that all of you will be participating in the campaign to get rid of single youth plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing in this mission in their own way, but a young man in our country has started implementing a mission in a unique way.
When I looked at his work, I had interacted with him from the telephone and tried to know his new experiments.
Perhaps the interaction with them will be beneficial to some other people in the country.
Shri Yut Ripudman Belvi ji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word plaguing for the first time, it was also new for me.
This programme is being implemented by you people in an innovative manner and in a particular way, in such a way that you would like the youth.
I convey my best wishes to you.
Friends, The Ministry of Sports is also organizing a Fit India Planning Run this year on the birth anniversary of Honble Bapu.
Two kilometres of plogging on 2nd October.
This programme will be organized all over the country.
We have heard of the experiences of Ripudman, how to do this programme and what should be done in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness about health is also increasing and awareness about cleanliness is also increasing.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians take a step towards getting rid of single use plastic, then India will move 130 crore steps together.
Riputman ji, once again thank you very much.
I extend my best wishes to you, to your team and to your vision.
I want to tell you a little about one thing.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat programme, I must tell you in detail about it, but today I am telling you that we should get the opportunity to prepare.
You must remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
So we will start preparations for it right now.
There is a lot of time to talk about this.
Some people can start their exercises and some other schemes can be prepared.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that on August 15, I had asked the Red Fort to visit 15 places in India by 2022.
Programme at least fifteen places and one or two night stays .
Let us see, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come on vacations on the occasion of Diwali, they definitely go to tour. So I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, now the World Tourism Day is celebrated on 27th September and some of the responsible institutions in the world present the tourism programme and you will be happy to know that India has improved in competitive index on tourism.
This is possible only because of the cooperation of all of us, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we make a further effort, we will certainly get the highest place in the world's major tourist destinations while completing 75 years of independence.
It should be happy and enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together, so that this collectiveness also gains a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper launched an initiative in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if the child gives more information about nature then it will be beneficial in the future to protect the environment.
The girl named Rida Nadaf of Laxmaneshwara has written that she is the daughter of a young man from the armed forces and she feels proud of this.
No Indian will feel the pride of the soldiers of the Army
And you are the daughters of that young man, it is natural for you to feel proud.
Irfan Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is at a distance of 5 km from his village, so he has to get out of the house quickly and is also late to return home.
He has informed that he cannot play with his friends for a long time and should have a school near his house.
Friends, I got the opportunity to save this letter from this kind of initiative by taking forward a newspaper.
It was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26 November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constituent Assembly accepted the event of India today.
The implementation of the Constitution began on 26th January, 1950 and that is why we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Parliament.
He took a tough decision for nearly three years to build a Constitution.
No field of life, no subject of nature has been dissolved.
Equality and sensitivity for all is the identity of our Constitution.
It is our duty to fulfil our constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators, everybody should describe the Constitution accordingly.
This is the message of the constitution that no one has any harm.
The Mussoorie Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the President of the Committee.
He played a very big role.
He said that every section of society will be benefitted.
On December 6, on his Mahaparinirvana, we recall him and salute him.
Babasaheb has a very big contribution in empowering and prospering the country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 15th December.
Sardar Patel, who created the identity of the son of the farmers as a iron man, has also done an extraordinary job to build the country in a uniform thread.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constitution.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee for fundamental rights, minority and tribals.
But nine years ago, the country could not forget that the terrorist attack on Mumbai was on 26-11 today.
Today, the country recalls the brave people, the police and the security forces who had lost their lives.
The country will never forget their sacrifices.
He is ready to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all the humanitarian powers of the world should come together and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken our social structure and destroy it.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to be more aware of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the Naval Day on 4th December.
Indian Navy protects its maritime shores.
I congratulate all the naval personnel.
You must have been aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Whether it is the river of Indus or river Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important in both economic and strategic.
These are the gateways for the entire world.
This country has an integral connection with the oceans of our land.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the navy of the Mala king was counted among the most capable navy during the Mala dynasty.
In the extension of the Maldives empire, his navy wanted to bring the empire into the form of an economic power at that time.
The Malaysian naval missions and many examples of research visits are still available in Sangam literature.
It will be very less people will be convinced that most of the ships in the world have been allowed to join women in a long time.
However, in the Maldives, and that too 800-900 years ago, women had played a pearl role.
These women were also involved in the war.
The Maldives had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval be forgotten while mentioning the naval
The territory of Konkan with marine forests was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj .
Several forts like Sindhudurg , Murud-Janjira , Golden Fort related to Shivaji Maharaj were in the coastal areas or were standing in the sea .
The navy of the Marathas used to protect these forts .
The Armaras of Marathas included large and small boats.
Their naval forces were fond of attacking any enemy and protecting themselves from the attack.
It is impossible to talk about Maratha Armara and not to mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new glory to Armara of Marathas and founded the foundations of Maratha soldiers at several places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy has played a pivotal role.
Whether it is the war of liberation of Goa or the India-Pakistan war of 1971.
The Indian Navy's INS Sumitra immediately helped rescue and handed over several fishermen safely out of the water to Bangladesh.
This year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka in May-June, three boats of our navy immediately reached there and they helped the government and the people there.
The naval naval INS Ghariyal had supported humanitarian cooperation in the field of Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea Government gave us SOS messages and helped their boats to save their fishermen from the boat.
On 21st November, the INS Trikand of our naval ship was also running for the help of a warship at a merchant ship in West Galf.
This is a day to honour and respect the security forces of the country and this year the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special campaign from 1st to 7th December.
Over a week, small children, big people, everybody flags the nation.
There should be a movement to honour the soldiers across the country.
On this occasion, we can flag off the armed forces.
Your neighbours, if you are associated with any of your acquaintances, you can post their experiences, their adventurous activities, photographs and photographs related to them at the Hashtag Armed Forcesflagday.
In the schools and colleges, they can invite the people of the army to get more information about the work of the army.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the army.
This is also an opportunity to collect money for the welfare of all our defence forces.
This fund is used by the Sainik Kalyan Mandal to rehabilitate the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war and for the welfare of the injured soldiers.
Let us also contribute to the strengthening of our armed forces on this occasion.
Let us also handle their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Whatever we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food habits are connected to the soil.
Imagine, if there is no nutritious soil in the world then what will happen
How's Sajeevi Tag Dammer
This was considered in our culture a long time ago and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since a long time.
In our culture, on the one hand, the feeling of devotion to the soil and respect for the soil was very natural in the minds of the people and the use of many scientific methods was also nutritious.
There is a lot of importance in the lives of the farmers of this country, devotion to our soil and its proper career from scientific perspective.
We all are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are aware of modern sciences and use them in the field of agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj Block and the farmers in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in an imbalanced manner so that the quality of soil was lowered.
As production decreased, the income of the farmers also decreased and the production of soil also decreased.
Some awakening farmers in the village were very familiar with the situation and then the farmers of the village examined their soil and they were advised to use soil, nutritious substances and biological fertilizers.
You will be surprised to know that the information given to the farmers through the Soil Health Card has shown positive impact on the implementation of the guidance.
In 2016-17, curd production has increased by three to four times and income has also increased by Rs. 4 to 6,000.
If we take care of the crops then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the mother of the dam then we will also be able to take care of it.
More than 10 crore farmers from all over the country have made soil health cards to get better information about their soil and to harvest them.
We devote to mother Dandi but have we considered how harmful the mother's health is the account of urea
It has been proved from many scientific experiments that the loss of land due to more urine than required.
The farmers are the sons of the mother of this dam and how will she fall sick to her mother
It is time to revive this relationship between mothers and sons.
Can our farmers take the pledge to bring the use of urea for our farming till the year 2022, i. e.
Once the sons of Dandi Mata, the farmers resolved that the health of the dam will improve rapidly and the production will also increase.
There will be a real change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now feeling that the global temperature increases, changes in the environment.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
Now it has come to December and it is getting cold .
It is our experience that winters have started and they don't have to get out of bed.
However, in such a season, people who are aware work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
However, the determination and determination were larger than all these.
The eight-year-old girl couldn't speak, but she took the foundation of a shirt.
Arising at 5 a.m. in the morning, this kid used to go to the household of the village and tell him not to open defecation.
This kumhari village has become Open Defecation Free every day due to the efforts of these children who are teaching cleanliness at least 30-40 households every day.
Every minute you get to learn something new.
Today, he is doing well in every sector.
Whether it is sports, competition, social initiatives, our disabled people are not behind in any case.
You all remember that in the Rio Olympic Games, our Divyang Sportspersons had earned 4 medals while playing the best and he also won the World Cup of the blind T-Twenty Cricket.
Several types of competitions are being organized across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Transfer Competition was organised at Udaipur.
There are no muscles in 80 percent of their body, but see their courage, determination and consciousness.
He also won the Gold in the 70th National Para Transfer Competition, with his skills, the Indian Sports Authority selected him for 20-20 Paralympics.
32 Para shipping crews and all of them will be trained at the Excellence Centre in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to Youth Jigar Thakkar ji.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of us to enhance peace and harmony in society, give new energy and empower new resolutions.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Kanpur to Neeraja Singh.
I urge you to repeat the best ten things that you have spoken through Mann Ki Baat in the year so that we can recall that and learn something else.
We have made very good information.
After listening to your words, I feel like putting a lot more in it and changing it.
Those people in our villages who live in old ages often say that do not forget sadness, do not forget happiness.
Whether it is a picture or a small story or a small telephone, I invite you to welcome 2018 in a good environment, with good memories and with positive ideas.
Let us share positive things on Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on Social Media.
Encouraging events that inspire others.
We can see the strength and impact of these collective efforts together.
I will definitely try to reach the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with you all for the Mann Ki Baat next month.
There will be an opportunity to speak many things.
Thank you very much
Six days after Deepawali, the Chhath festival is one of the festivals of our country in devotion.
In which traditional rules were followed from diet to costume.
The unique festival of Chhathpuja is completely associated with the worship of nature and nature .
The sun and water are at the centre of Chhath worship, while bamboo and earthen pots and pots are useful in this worship.
The world worships Ugawat but in Chhath Pujas also gives us a version to worship those who are certain.
This festival also includes the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Everybody is encouraging the cleanliness of the entire house and the cleanliness of rivers, ponds, shores and pilgrimage ghats.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja - Travel Protection, Disease Redressal and Good Governance.
Usually eat from behind, these are the shortcomings and inferior sentiments.
However, this is a special tradition of eating prasad after half the morning in Chhathpuja.
The reason behind eating Prasad was that the ego was destroyed and ego is such a feeling that the progress of the person is sustainable.
It is natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat is built with the people of the country.
Take examples of khadi and handlooms.
You will be happy to know that on Gandhi Jayanti, I always urge you for handlooms, Khadi and what is the result.
Let me tell you that on 17th October of this month, a record sale of one crore twenty lakh rupees was registered in Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi.
You might have been happy to hear that such a large number of fertilizers and handlooms have been sold from one store.
During Deepawali, sales in Gift Kupn of Khadi have increased by about 680.
The sale of manufacturing and handicrafts has also increased by about 90 percent this year as compared to last year.
Today, the youth, the adults, the women, the people of every age group like Khadi and handlooms.
I can imagine how much benefits have been given to the weaving families, poor families and those working on handlooms from this business.
However, from the experiences of the past, I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for fashion have now replaced Khadi for transformation.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, in the lives of the poorest of the poor, in the lives of the poorest of the poor, it is becoming a means to transform, empower and empower them.
This is a big role in the rural industry.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experiences of Deepawali along with my security forces and to know how our security forces celebrate Deepawali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also asked the Narendra Modi App that can there be arrangements to reach our sweets to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our house should reach the youth of the country.
We must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali also brought me a special experience.
I respect every soldier of the security forces, along with all the countrymen, for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces have protected the country while facing the difficult and difficult situation.
Whenever you get time, whenever you get time, you will get to know the experience of the youngsters, you will have to listen to their honour.
Many of you do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in global peace.
Everyone is aware of the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace across the world and their positive geography.
And we believe that the world is my family, the Vasudhaiva family.
Because of this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since the beginning.
All of you are aware that the proposal for India's settlement and the proposal of the UN Charter was started by the word 'Woe the People'.
India has always stressed on women's equality and the UN declaration on human rights is a living example.
The proposals made in his International Frame were changed by the efforts of the representative of All Men and Born Free Equal India, and later accepted the All Human Beings R.
If you see, this is a small change, but there was a strong idea.
Indias role in UN Peacekeeping Operations is an important contribution made by India through UN Ambrella.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
Normally, seven thousand soldiers were linked to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
These efforts of peace were made in some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kango, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, 20 thousand patients were treated in the hospital of the Indian Army and saved countless people.
Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also lived in the minds of those people.
Indian women have also played an important role in building peace.
India is the only country in Liberia that in the Shanti Abhiyan Mission, India has sent women police units, very few people are aware.
And this step in India will inspire the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to peace campaigns but also training in peace initiatives in 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our extremist peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Shanti Abhiyan is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to do this work by going to the remote areas.
His memory blossoms the heart of every countrymen with pride.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, he was a brave man who was honored with Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji made a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year, he was appointed as Forse Commander for Namibiat, Operations and he served to ensure independence in that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Forum in Cyprus and bowed down in peace.
As a messenger of peace, India always gave a message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everybody should live in peace and harmony and move ahead with the vision of creating a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage is happy with such great personalities who have served humanity without feeling of selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call sister Nivedita, is also one of these ordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of Nivedita.
The implication is completely dedicated.
He later proved himself by working in accordance with name.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita celebrated 1.
The period of Swami Vivekananda was so impressed that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very distressed by the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only made our country a slave but they also tried to make us mentally slaves.
It was always going on to create a humidity by reducing our culture.
Bhagwan Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to keep people together by awakening the national consciousness.
He raised his voice against the opponents of peace and philosophy in different countries of the world.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumri Penn, New Women and Women Empowerment.
It was believed that his inspiration was Bhagwan Nivedita.
Bhagwan Nivedita ji also helped great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
We have helped in research and propaganda to sit through our writings and conferences.
This is the beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu is an excellent example.
Hundreds of people lost their lives in Kolkata in 1899.
Sister Nivedita started the work of cleaning the roads and drains without taking care of her health.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life, but he was associated with the service of the poor.
People helped them in the service service by taking inspiration from them.
He taught people about cleanliness and service from his work.
He wrote on his memorial, "Hyer Repose Sister Nivedita Hu Gave Har All to India", wherein Sister Nivedita rested, who gave all of you to India.
Undoubtedly, he has done this.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the children of his first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary.
Children are the heroes of New India.
It is our concern that earlier the diseases used to occur in old age and the diseases used to occur at the last stage of life - they are also seen in small children.
This kind of disease would have happened in the youth as well.
However, now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
There should be such diseases in the youth that are less physical activity and changes in the dietary system .
It is important for the society and the family to pay attention to this.
When we think about this, you will be aware that there is no need to do anything faster.
There is only a need to change our habits, change our habits, change our habits regularly.
Instead of going to the elevators take the habit of climbing the stairs .
After dinner, try to take the entire family along with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will help in self-sufficient lifestyle and prevent lifestyle disorders.
30 minutes before the school, the speciality of Yoga is that Yoga is easy and accessible.
And I tell you that Yoga can be easily done by any adult.
It is easy to learn the easiest ways and make it easier to do anywhere.
For this, there is no need for special means and support.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the last few days in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons have brightened the name of the country in different fields.
India won Asia Cup Hockey Trophy while playing a glorious game in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best sportspersons and India became Asia Cup champions ten years later.
Earlier, India Asia Cup Champions were held in 2003 and 2007.
I extend my best wishes to the Hockey team and all their teams.
After Hockey, there is also a thrilling text in Badminton.
The Badminton Star Kidambi Srikantan won the Denmark Open Trophy and honoured the country.
This is the third Super Series Premiere Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, FIFA under Seventeen World Cups will be organised this month.
Several teams from all over the world came to India and showed their skills in the football field.
I also got the opportunity to see a face.
There was a lot of enthusiasm in sportspersons.
This big event of the World Cup was watching us all over the world.
I was overwhelmed to see such a big face and the energy, enthusiasm and fervor of young players.
World Cup events were successful and all the unions performed the best.
Even though India did not get a bulk, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
This festival of sports has been enjoyed all over the world along with India and this whole competition has become thrilling and entertaining for football lovers...
The football is indicating that the future is bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, to justify the feelings of the people I write on the subject of Swachh Bharat, I have to do this programme every day and just dedicate my mind to cleanliness.
Some children send photographs of their efforts and some section of the youth are in it.
Wherever there is a story of a new initiative on cleanliness, there is a news of change in the zeal of an officer.
A few days ago, I received a detailed report, in which there is a statement of law in the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
The Cleanliness Campaign was launched at Chandrapur Fort by an NGO called Ecological Protection Organization.
People did not stop or fatigue or work for the sanitation of the fort in this two hundred-day campaign.
I am surprised to see the photographs and whoever saw the photographs, who had been disappointed with the surrounding despair, would have ever felt that the dreams of cleanliness will be fulfilled.
They will turn their disappointment into confidence.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Guru Nanak Devji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is a Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity and addressed all the tribes.
He stressed on women empowerment and womens dignity.
Guru Nanak Devji traveled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey, he taught the truth humanity.
He interacted with the people, showed the path of truth, sacrifice and duty.
He gave a message of social equality and showed this teaching not only by speaking but by showing it.
He started the anchor, which led to the creation of service in the people.
There was a feeling of unity and equality in the people by eating food sitting together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - remember, work, work and help when needed.
Guru Nanak Devji constructed Gurbani to tell his principles.
In the coming 2019, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Devji's five and a half light year.
Let us try to walk on the path of his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October two days.
We are aware that he had laid the foundation stone of a modern India.
Today, we can learn a lot from the life of this great saint of Mother India.
The feature of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is that he is not only a transformative idea, but he is also committed to finding practical solutions from the complicated problems of achieving it.
He was skilled in realizing the ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked as an instrument for India.
It should be ensured that millions of Indians can be brought into the shadow of a nation and a constitution.
He empowered him to overcome all his complications.
He honoured the place where he needed to be honoured.
They used the bulk wherever they needed to use the bullock.
He decided a goal and was guided by his determination with that goal.
We could do the same thing to keep the country together.
He dreamed of a nation where all the people were equal.
I believe that the ideas of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are always inspiring.
He said, We cannot prevent any discrimination of caste and religion, all of us are daughters and daughters of India, we must love the country and make future on mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring for the vision of New India.
And his birth anniversary is celebrated as National Integration Day.
I urge all of you to join the Run for Unity in this festival of our goodwill.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali vacations, with new resolutions, with new determinations, all of you have come to your daily life.
My countrymen, my best wishes to all their dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
Three years have been completed through the astronomy of Mann Ki Baat.
Today, this is the 36th part.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Many things have to be done to improve the government.
There are some individual complaints.
And I take half an hour from a month, but people are sending their words on Mann Ki Baat for three days.
The result is that there has been sensitivity in the government too.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is an inflammatory journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time, I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am very grateful to the countrymen.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba often used to say that non-governmental, non-governmental miracles will affect.
This thing has been kept away from the political colors, instead of being distracted, a stable mind has tried to connect with you and to connect with you.
Three years later, I am aware that social researchers, universities, research intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze this.
And I am confident that the ideas made by such a combination will be more beneficial for Mann Ki Baat.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that it is necessary to worry about eating and drinking as much as possible.
After that, I saw a large number of letters from every corner of the country.
Many social organisations and many youngsters are already working on this.
I remember that there are many people who have been working to synergize the food habits that are being used in the field of food processing.
Once I saw the Selfie with Dr. of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I told them all in Mann Ki Baat.
See, not only in India but also in the whole world, such a big campaign was started.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
A few days ago, I used to interact with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people who are going out to roam, wherever you go on the subject of Incredible India, lakhs of photographs have come.
This is in a way a big destination for those working in the tourism sector from every corner of India.
This Mann Ki Baat has given me the experience of how a small event can create a major movement.
Today, I was contemplating that the Mann Ki Baat had started for three years. Many events in the last three years have touched my mind.
Every minute the country is being considered to go through the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society and for the progress of the country.
I have understood and learned from the people of the country in the Mann Ki Baat campaign of this three years.
I bow down to the countrymen.
Once I had discussed Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
I once again urge you to continue the campaign of Khadi which has started.
If we buy Khadi then we should work with this feeling that the brightness of Deepavali is going to brighten the house of the poor.
And that is why we should do this thing.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase production capabilities, how can we bring solar energy
The idea is on how to revive the old 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years have been closed.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri was closed for 26 years but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked to it.
Many people have been provided with new employment opportunities.
In Pampore, Kashmir, Khadi and Village Industries have once again started their training centres and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this region.
Now the resumption of this training centre will help in modernizing the new generation, clothing and inclusion of new things.
People have also started giving fertilizer goods while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect the people.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated this work and participated in the entire country.
Whether it is old or old, men or women, cities or Khedagaon, everybody has become a part of this Swachhta Mission.
When I say, 'Sankalp to Siddhi' is now moving towards a resolution.
Everybody accepts, supports and contributes to this movement.
I express my gratitude to the respected President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has regarded it as its work.
I believe that these things are good and it is a matter of great pleasure for me that in the first four days only about 75 lakh people have participated in the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign and I have seen that some people have been working continuously and the results will continue to work.
One thing is that we have to do cleanliness somewhere and the other thing is that we dont have to make cleanliness aware but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then there is also a need for a ideological movement.
Several competitions were held in connection with the Swachhata Hi Seva Abhiyan.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the essay competition on sanitation.
Thousands of children took pictures.
Using their ideas, they have drawn pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Many people wrote poems and these days, the pictures that I have sent by my young friends and children are posted on social media.
I don't forget to thank the people of the media whenever they come to the topic of cleanliness.
These people have carried forward this movement in a very good manner.
They are also leading the Swachhata Abhiyan in their own way.
In this Swachhata Hi Seva movement, we can see how big service can be done through electronic media and printed media in our country.
Just a few days ago, some of my 18-year-old youngsters from Srinagar, Bilal Dar, took care of me.
Nothing like that.
Bill Dar works for cleanliness for the last five-six years since the age of 12-13 years.
The largest pond in Asia is near Srinagar, the pond is plastic, the polythene, the bottles used, the waste, the waste, the pond cleans everything out.
Bill Dar is younger than age, but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the future history is born from the womb of history and it is natural to remember the great men when history comes out.
This is the month of October to remember many of our great men.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh was happy with the work of Gramodya, except for his political life and when his centenary year is being celebrated today, it is very natural to feel proud of the work of his village.
The former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji, had always spoken about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh during his interaction with the youth.
With great respect, he used to mention Nanaji's work and he himself went to villages to see Nanaji's work.
Deendayal Upadhyay ji was talking about a person at the end of the society like Mahatma Gandhi.
Sardar Saheb had brought the entire country together.
Now we should also run for unity and take the mantra of unity forward.
We are very easily saying that unity in diversity is the specialty of India.
We honour the diversity, but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to repeat to my countrymen from India, especially to my younger generation, that we are in an awakening situation.
Winters are holidays, days of Diwali, somewhere or the other in our country.
People go out as tourists and they are very natural .
But sometimes it seems a matter of concern that our people don't see our country, they don't know the diversity of the country.
You must go to the outside country and I don't oppose it, but sometimes you must see the places of our country.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and his former President Abdul Kalam ji looked at his life then one thing was recalled that when they visited India, they were brought to India and at the same time they were inspired to live for this country and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had visited India in a broad way.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
Increase in tourism will be such a time when we don't just go to Paramulukh as a child, go as a student and try to understand their lives.
In more than four and a half hundred districts, I have also got the opportunity to rest in the night and today, whenever I take this big responsibility in India, I am feeling a lot of comfort.
It does not take time at all.
I urge you all to not only announce the 'unity in diversity' in this huge India, but also the gift of our traditional power.
We have many types of food habits .
If we keep eating a new substance every day then there are so many types that the first substance will not come again.
Now, this is a major strength of our tourism.
I am confident that if you go out to visit this time too then you will take my first campaign forward.
You must send photographs on 'Hash Tag Incredible India'.
If you meet the people there then send their photographs.
I believe that in order to encourage tourism in India, what can be the seven best tourist destinations in our state and every Indian should be aware of the seven special destinations in his state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we get some information about these places
Can we provide this information on the Narendra Modi App
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
You should think that if all the people of one state start asking for such a good information then I would like to tell the government to distribute the information that has come and create a publicity literature about which seven things have come from every state.
This means how can tourism places be encouraged in a way through the means of people .
The Government of India will work on it.
Let us join me.
You can also become a big and important partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I am inviting you for that.
My dear countrymen, many things touch my mind as a human being.
There are waves in my mind.
Some of the things on my mind are ruined.
Finally, I am a man like you.
Indian Army has received two brave gifts as Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
For this reason, both freedom and funds were martyred by serving Bharat Mata.
You can imagine that if the world is destroyed at such a young age then how will the situation be
However, Swati Mahadik, wife of martyr Col. Santosh Mahadik, took a stand in the mind while facing this difficult situation and was filled in the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months to complete the training and also took his life to fulfil his husband's dreams.
Likewise, Mr. Mukesh Dubey, President of Fund Dubey, was acting as the hero in the Army and was martyred for the motherland.
Their wife fund decided that we would be filled in the army and they would fulfill the determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to respect our mother-power and these brave men.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and the festival of Deepawali is a great opportunity for the youth of the country.
The FIFA World Culture Competition is going to be held in our country this year under 17 years.
I am confident that you will have to hear the announcement of football all around.
Each age group will have to increase interest in football.
It is not possible that our youngsters are not seen playing in the fields of schools and colleges of India.
Come, let the whole world come to play on the land of India, then let us make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
Mother Durga is the time of worshipping .
How is the whole atmosphere filled with sacred fragrance .
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the whole country celebrates the festival, on the other hand, violence comes from any part of India, it is natural to worry about the country and this is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
It is the country of Sardar Patel, who brought our lives for the unity of the country.
For generations, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life and non-violence with equal respect.
We have been listening to Ahimsa Paramo Dharma since childhood.
I had said from Red Fort that violence will not be used in the name of faith, whether it is a traditional belief or a belief in political ideals, even if there is faith in the person, there is no right to take legislation in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the people of the country that those who take the laws, those who dominate the path of violence, whether they are individuals or groups, the country will never tolerate it and no government will bear it.
Everyone has to bow before the laws.
Because of thousands of years of cultural traditions, cultural traditions, social traditions, historical events, perhaps there should not be a single day in 365 days which would have been without any support.
Now we must have seen that our festivals continue to run according to the nature cycle.
There is a direct relation with nature .
Most of our festivals are connected to the farmers.
First of all, I want to call you Michami Dukkadam.
Yesterday the celebrations of Sawantsari were celebrated in the Jain community.
In the Jain society on the occasion of Parishana Parva is celebrated in Bhadramas.
On the last day of the Paryatan Parv, it is the day of the sanctuary.
This is indeed a unique tradition.
The day of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it is also going to the Mandal Day and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a mild dukkadam .
We have heard these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi used to say that it is the specialty of a strong man to empower him.
In his play, Shakespeare has written to explain the importance of efficiency in the 'Marchant of Venice' that is, 'Marcy is two blasts, it blesses him that gives and what he has been empowered', both of them get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated at every corner of the country with great joy.
When the subject of Ganesh Chaturthi comes then it is natural to speak on public Ganesh Festival .
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi takes place ten days.
This Mahasana is considered a symbol of unity, equality and significance.
My heartfelt congratulations to all nations and brothers and sisters.
ONAM was recently celebrated in Kerala.
One of the diverse festivals in India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is recognised by our social and cultural importance.
Nowadays this festival is seen becoming the reason of tourism attraction .
I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way .
Besides, there is an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to think about what we can do in that direction.
The festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated all over the country in a few days in the series of these festivals.
Id-ul-uha greetings to all the countrymen.
The festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us.
We have to make our New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals are connected to cleanliness in family life.
Cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to be a social nature.
Cleanliness should be an integral part of our country, not only in the house but in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernization is changing.
A big campaign like Eco-Friendly Ganapati has been launched.
If you look at the YouTube then every household girl is making Ganapati, bringing soil and making Ganapati.
Somebody is working on vegetables, somebody is pieces of paper.
Different kinds of experiments are being done in every family.
And when I know new experiments.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
The toilet power has reached around 67 pieces from 39 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of Pura decreased then the dirt was spread everywhere.
At the same time, the worker of Ulema-e-Hind in Jamia in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat purified 22 temples and 3 masjids respectively.
Everybody sweated and everybody went out.
The best example of unity for cleanliness, inspiring examples for everyone, were given by all the workers of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.
And if this becomes our sustainable spirit then where can our country go
My dear countrymen, I urge all of you to run the Swachhata Hi Seva before 15-20 days of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
Make an environment of cleanliness across the country.
Whenever you get the opportunity, we should find the opportunity.
But we all come together.
On the day of holiday or Sunday come together and work together .
Go to the neighbourhood but work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social and cultural political leaders, collectors and Sarpanches to create an atmosphere of hygiene 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov
There is a department on which you can write the name of your family and the name of your family after the construction of toilets.
My friends from social media can run some constructive campaigns and actually work on the world.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is organizing Swachh Sankalp Competition in which essay competitions, small film making competitions, painting competitions are being organised.
In this, we can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age.
You can make small films by your mobile.
You can make a film of 2-3 minutes that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this Swachhta Mission.
I would like to reiterate that on 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti, take a pledge to celebrate Swachhta 2nd October and for this, the Swachhta Hi Seva Mantra should be delivered from 15th September to the household.
Some or the other steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Self-employment should be part of it.
You see how this hypnotise will brighten Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after the 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on 2nd October, we will be happy to pay homage to the serving Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I especially want to accept my loans.
I express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart that we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I would like to express my gratitude to you for accepting loans that millions of loggings are being linked to the country through the Mann Ki Baat program.
I have the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
I am waiting for our message as much as you look forward to Mann Ki Baat.
I am awaiting because I get to learn something from all your things.
And that is why I express my gratitude to you for your contribution.
We are collaborating with our mobile phones and become a part of such wrong habits.
PM ji, I speak from Pune to Aparna.
I would like to tell about my friend that I have always tried to help people but I was tired to see a habit of it.
Once I went to the shopping mall with him.
We pay without paying any money at large, but we contribute to our hardworking brothers and sisters, they are unbelievable.
Didn't you think that there is a connection with the sellers, small shopkeepers and vegetable sellers who are near our households, when they are connected to those who are suffering, then we feel goods with them.
Not only this, we talk about reducing two-five rupees and we went to the big hotels to enjoy that the bill doesn't even pay.
The question is not worth Rs.
He is poor, so he doubted his honesty that there would not be a difference in your life by two-five rupees but how much of his small habit would he have been pushing him into a big habit
I am grateful to you all that you have given me a message by calling your heart.
I am confident that my countrymen will also leave behaving like this with the poor.
My dear young friends, on 29th August the entire country is celebrating the National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of great Hockey players and Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I would like to recall this thing that the new generation of our country should be associated with sports.
Sports should be a part of our lives.
If we are youngsters in the world, then our country should be seen in the field of youth sports.
Sports means physical fitness, intellectual efficiency, emotional co-operation.
I understand what should be more than that
Sports is in a way a herb that connects the heart .
Let our younger generation move forward in the field of sports. Today, in the era of computer, I want to tell you that sports sector is more important than sports stations.
Play fifa sports on computer but show some work on the outskirts.
The joy of playing crickets in the fields opener than the cricket on the computer is somewhat different.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and mother asked you to go home.
Today the situation is such that when the children come home they see games or cartoon films on mobile while sitting on the corner then the mother has to shout and ask if you are ever out jewellery .
This was a time when the mother told the child that you would ever come to this time that when will you go out of the child
It is a matter of great pleasure for our youth that the FIFA World Cup is being organised in October 6 to 28 under 17 years.
Today, when I was talking about sports, there was an incident that had touched the mind in the last week, which I would like to tell the people.
I got the opportunity to meet a younger girl, some of whom were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days have been spent in water, this six girls in the waves of the sea will be the first incident in the world.
Any Indian who will not be proud of such girls
I salute these daughters and I bow down to them and tell them this experience to all the countrymen.
I will also provide a different place for Narendra Modi's power to their experiences.
Because we must save their experiences because it is a kind of adventurous story, a story of prosperity and I am glad to reach these daughters, my best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate the Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he was presenting himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
Enjoyment of creative emotions and knowledge among our students is an important feature of the teacher.
When we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we resolve together
Let us communicate with a resolution for five years and let us enjoy the fulfillment of the resolution in five years.
There is an incident in every teacher's life that his efforts would have changed due to changes in life.
If we make a collective effort, we can play a big role in the change of the country.
I work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University in Mumbai.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, economic integrity is a matter of discussion not only of India but of the scholars from all over the world.
On August 28, 2014, the scheme was launched with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, the project will be completed for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been removed.
Today, I am happy that the poor of the society have been made part of the country's economy.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that the money will help the children.
Some good work can be done in the future.
Not only this, those who see the RuPay Card in their treasure, they feel like Mr.
He feels a glorious experience.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65 thousand crore has been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the future and the insurance of the accounts opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been removed.
The Prime Minister's Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJY) has created a big confidence in the poor today.
If something happens to the mainstream of the family, the family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today, I would like to tell the people of the bank to upload it to my government.
My dear countrymen, again we have a mild piece of money.
Thank you very much.
The mind of the person feels that he feels very charming in the rainy season.
Animals , birds , trees , nature all are happy with the arrival of rains .
However, this rain sometimes takes a virtuous form and then it feels that there is such a great strength in bringing destruction in water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes the terrible form of natural calamities that are seen in floods and earthquakes prove to be terrible.
The changes in the changing climate cycle and the environment are also getting very negative.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities.
Complete care is being taken on the flood affected areas.
Whether it is the soldiers of the Indian government, the people of the Air Force, the people of NDRF, the expedition teams, all of them bow down in the service of the victims.
It has an impact on farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification and connectivity.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, we can also create a timeline for our work according to the climate.
When I prepare Mann Ki Baat, I see the people of the country preparing it more than me.
On this occasion, I have received a lot of letters on GST, a lot of phone calls have come and people are still happy about GST and are expressing confusion.
A phone call will also listen to you: Namaskar, Pradhan Mantri ji, I speak from Goodgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the speech of your Saudi Accountant Day and was very affected.
Similarly, in our country, GST was launched on the same date of last month.
Whether the government has expected this decision and whether the results are being received after a month or not.
I want to hear your ideas about this.
It has been almost a month since the implementation of GST and its benefits have also started to appear.
I am glad that whenever a poor person writes a letter to me about how the prices of the poor have been reduced due to GST, how the goods have become cheap.
Whatever the matter was not known in the past, it used to be scared, but now it seems as if the work was easier than ever before, in the remote hills of Ishaan, in the forests.
All these facilities are not only there, but it is also being strengthened to achieve the economic pace.
The speed at which this change has been transformed, the speed at which it has transformed, has created an atmosphere of faith throughout the country.
In the field of economies, scholars in the field of management, scholars in the field of technologies, India's use of GST will never be in front of the world as an ideal system.
It will become a case-style for many universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has been made and with the participation of millions of people, it is a big step to make this tax in such a large country successfully.
All the decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre together.
As a result, every government has preferred that GST does not have any excessive burden on the cost of foodgrains of poor.
You are well aware that what was the price before GST and what is the price in a new situation is available on the GST app on mobile.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the workers of the central and state government for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective forces.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a taxation, but a new authentic culture.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I salute crores of crores of people for fulfilling such a big task.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, in August, there have been several such incidents that have been specially associated with the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people will be aware that Dr.
Yusuf Mehr Ali gave it.
What happened on 9th August, 1942 should be known to our new generation.
What can be a bigger inspiration than that
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indian independence.
This movement had prepared the entire country to take a pledge to be free from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian people, every corner of India, every corner of the country, the villages, the cities, the cities, the uneducated, the poor, the poor, everybody, shoulder to shoulder, became part of the uit India movement.
In response to the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were blew up their lives in the struggle by taking the mantra of 'Karo Maro'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and had left their books.
The great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan had played a key role.
Gandhiji's two different forms are seen in both the events of Sahakar Abhiyan and Bharat Leave Abhiyan - 1920 and 1942.
The format of Sahakar Abhiyan was different and in the last 42 years, the rapidity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo Die'.
Behind all these successes, there were peoples support, peoples power, peoples resolve, peoples struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857 when I saw the leaves of history slightly connected.
This freedom struggle, which began from 1857, was going on every moment in some part of the country till 1942.
This long-term period awakened the feeling of freedom in the minds of the people of the country.
Everybody was committed to doing something in that direction.
Generations have changed, but the resolutions have not moved.
People were coming and connected, they went out, new people were coming and the country was making every effort to overthrow the royalty of the British.
It was five years decisive.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
In 1947, we became independent.
Today, 2017 is going on.
It took about 70 years.
During the period, the governments came.
Organisations have changed, have changed, have gone away and have increased.
Everybody tried their own way to free the country from the problem.
Efforts have been made to increase employment, to overcome poverty and to achieve development.
In your way, hardships have also emerged for them.
He also achieved success.
He was also higher than that.
As in 1942 to 1947, it was five years of commitment.
Similarly, I see that the five-year period from 2017 to 2022 is now in front of us.
We will celebrate this 15th August, 2017 as a Sankalp Parv and when 75 years of independence will be completed in 2022, we will fulfill the resolution.
Today, not just the announcement of 'Kerenge Marenge' but also to connect with the resolution of a New India, it is a matter of great tribulation to achieve success.
This resolution has to be awakened and fought.
Let us run a massive campaign from the resolution to its achievement on 9th August in August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local institutions, schools, colleges and different organizations should make some or the other new resolutions for New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will be a part of this resolution festival, today we must be somewhere else or not online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially in the online world, to come forward to contribute in the creation of a New India.
Let us take all such ideas, such as video, post, blog, index, and new ideas, using technology.
Give this mission the form of a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on the Narendra Modi App.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread and propagate it in a broader manner.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am merely on the occasion.
You must send your views on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
I will automatically read it and I will try to ask for this idea in the time I get on August 15.
For the last three times, I have heard a complaint about my 15th August speeches that my speech was a little longer.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a social economy in India's economy.
And that economy will never be able to write less.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and joy.
Our festivals are also a medium of social reform.
However, every festival has a direct connection with the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
Within a few days, there will be a celebration of Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesha Festival, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Diwali. And this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their economies.
And this festival also mixes a simple natural joy.
And if you want to tell about the economy, hundreds of families start making shields through small domestic industries several months before the Raksha Mantri.
How many kinds of silk bags are made from khadi to silk bags and nowadays people have started giving more choice to homemades and household shields.
Business of thousands and thousands of people is connected to the festival of shield makers, shielders, sweets and sweets.
He has a direct connection with that poor family that makes small lights of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I want to consider the issue of environment.
And he has urged me to talk about the eco-friendly Ganesha statue in the context of Ganesha festival so that people can be able to select the statue of soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these awakening citizens.
He urged me to ask for this subject before.
This year's public Ganesh festival has a special significance.
And I am sure you all will be connected to this resolution a long time ago.
And the poor artisans and poor artists who make this statue will get employment and they will fill the stomach of the poor.
Let us make efforts to connect our festivals with the poor, to connect with the economy of the poor, to enjoy our festivals to the economic benefits of the poor and to enjoy the economic benefits of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for several festivals and festivals.
We are proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our girls demonstrated their sports gloriously in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
He was very happy to speak to him, but I realized that there was a lot of turmoil in his mind that the world was not able to win.
Their skins were rotten and their stress was visible.
I told them a different analysis.
I said, "Look at this time, there is a time of renowned media that it has been increased.
Such an increase is made that when success is not achieved then the aspirations change in the cycle.
We have seen a number of such sportspersons in which if India's players are disabled then the country's anger is on those players.
Some people leave their limits and write such things that are very painful.
But for the first time, even though our girls were not able to win the world-wide, 1. 25 billion people of the country took the burden of that defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Each countrymen should take a pledge and every countrymen should take the initiative to achieve that pledge in the next five years.
Come, let us come together and look forward to doing something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Weather is changing.
The summer was also very strong this year.
However, the monsoon rains took place on time and the next phase is going on in a smooth manner.
Heavy rains in many parts of the country are very pleasant.
Due to heavy rains, it has been relieved from the heat waves of the last few days.
And we all have seen that however race in life, however stress, individual life or public life, the arrival of rains changes our minds.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and enthusiasm in many parts of the country today.
Even in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
The country is connected to the poor by Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who do .
Babasaheb Ambedkar had studied, he might have seen that Lord Jagannath ji had a lot of praise for the temples and his traditions, because it included social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramadan was celebrated with sacred passion.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
I extend my best wishes to all on the occasion of Id-ul-Fitrah.
The month of Ramadan is a month to donate Pune.
There is a month of joy and as much joy as it feels.
Come on, let us take the country forward by taking inspiration from these holy festivals.
In this holy month of Ramadan, the inspirational event of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village, in a way, there is a greater population of brothers and sisters of our Muslim families.
During this Ramzan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
He also received help from the government for this individual toilet and Rs. 17 lakh was given to him under this scheme.
17 lakhs will be spent for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this holy day into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One thing of them is also very inspirational.
And the most important thing is that he made Mubarakpur open.
We know that in our country, Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared ODF this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, the government and the people for completing this work.
Whenever there was a feeling of the body and the mind.
The subject of cleanliness is similar.
These bad habits have become part of our nature.
We have become part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of it.
Everybody will have to pay attention.
The good inspirational events will have to be recalled again and again.
And I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the society and the common man.
And when people sitting in the government also take this task from the public participation then their strength increases by several times.
Recently, an excellent event came in my mind, which I would like to tell you.
The event is in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there had taken a lot of work from the public participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Build toilets in 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that people and administration have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages have become ODF.
I congratulate the people living in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village in Vijayanagaram district, they have shown a very inspirational example with tireless hard work.
Prakash Tripathy's awareness towards democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not only a system but it is also a culture.
Awareness in inner is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness about democracy is essential and that is why we used to recall the facts that were hurt by democracy and move forward towards good things of democracy.
1975-25 June was such a period that no democratic lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into tricolor.
The opponent sound was pressed.
Jaiprakash Narayan ji and other dignitaries of the country were drowning in the tricolor.
The judiciary was not able to escape the horrific shadow of the crisis.
The newspapers were completely unemployed.
Todays journalists, students from all over the world, people working in democracy, have been constantly trying to increase awareness about democracy and keep doing so.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in the clutches.
Atal ji had written a poem when he completed a year and he described the conditions of the time in his poem.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian has highlighted the dignity of the world.
21st June, 2017, the entire world was commendable.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning and evening through yoga.
There are no Indians who cannot be proud of this.
It is not possible that Yoga was not practiced earlier, but today when Yoga has been built in the threshold of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Most of the world's countries have made this opportunity for Yoga.
In China's The Great Wall of China, people performed yoga at a height of 2400 metres from sea level at Machu-Pitchu, a world heritage site in Peru.
People practiced yoga in the shadow of Iffel Tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Friendship Dam or Salma Dam.
Yoga category was organised with Yoga Masters at the UN Headquarters.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad received a new global record by doing yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to join the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I was fortunate to do yoga in the rains.
In Siachen, where our soldiers had 20, 25 and 40 degree temperatures, they also performed yoga.
Be it our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBPs, CRPFs, everybody has made Yoga as a part of their work.
On this Yoga Day, I used to say that because this is the third International Day of Yoga, I used to say that three generations of the family should send me their photographs while doing yoga together.
Some telephone channels also raised this issue.
I have received several photographs in this regard, some of these selected photographs have been collected on the Narendra ModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to go to my very favorite event.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has visited Kerala for some years.
N.
A good programme is organised by the reputation of Panikar and people are celebrated on reading day and reading month to make people aware about reading books.
Now recall the things that I had discovered in my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that if we don't want to blossom, we would like to welcome it with books or handlooms.
Even then Khadi handicrafts will be increased so that Khadi can be encouraged.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we had become a habit of all of us, but after coming here, it was my habit.
But he went to Kerala and once again he became aware of the habit.
And now I have started informing the people below the government.
We can also become a habit gradually .
The life of flowers was very low.
Once he took it in his hand and then kept it in his hand.
But if the books are given then they become part of the house in a way and become part of the family.
When I am talking about this, how many historical values were such things.
When I went to England last year, British queen Elizabeth in London invited me to eat.
How many years have passed, but ueen Elizabeth has kept the role of Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was delighted to show you.
And when I was looking at him, he was insisting that I should touch him.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change continuously and whenever they say this, the vaccine has to be rich.
However, we have to talk about these things and try to keep doing it.
Now I cannot say where I went and if someone gave me a blossom then I would deny it.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many kinds of works.
However, I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me every day and that gives me the opportunity to join the common man.
Several types of letters come and they write letters from different types of men.
Recently, I will be able to read a letter and I would like to tell you about that.
Arulmozhi Saran, a resident of Madurai, Tamil Nadu in south India, sent me a letter.
And what was happening in the letters, he was writing that he thought of taking some or the other economic initiatives in keeping with the education of children in his family, so that the family could get some financial help.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and brought some goods from the market and started working towards supplying it.
Some people asked, I have registered it myself. I would like to tell the people of the country that you should also get such an opportunity at the internet.
Get a visit to GEM. There is a new kind of arrangement.
Those who want to supply goods to the government, want to sell trees, want to sell peacocks and send tables, they can register their names on them.
Those who register under EEGM see all the departments of the government.
Many things are cheaper due to lack of agents.
This Arulmozhi Madam has registered the goods that they can provide on this website of the Government.
The letters they have written to me are very interesting.
He has written that once he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started and I wrote that what I can supply on e-GEM and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what the Prime Minister's Office would have asked for.
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arulmozhi didn't write to me, I might not have noticed that a householder is working in the e-GEM system far and wide, his goods can be purchased from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-market-GEM
I wish that those who have to sell their goods to the government should add more to it.
I believe that the Minimum Government and the Minimum Governance are the best examples and what is this objective - Minimum Price and MSP, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand, the success that we have in space science can be proud of.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga then our dreams are also to cross the distances of the sky.
A few days ago, India has shown a lot in sports and science.
India is hoisting its flags not only on earth but also on space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Satellite Satellites including Cartosat-2 Malike satellites.
These satellites included approximately 14 satellites from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America besides India.
And this Small Satellite Campaign of India will help in the field of farming and natural calamities.
Just a few days ago, you would have remembered that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And this was the worst satellite in the satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weight of the elephant.
You can imagine how much our scientists have done in the field of space.
On 19th June the Mangal Mission completed 1 thousand days .
You must be aware that when we were successfully able to get a place for Mangal Movement, the entire Movement was for a period of 6 months.
If the scientific information is being received then it has been working for more than the determined life.
The completion of one thousand days is important for our space journey for our scientific journey.
At present, we are also looking at the sports sector that our youth are enhancing their performance.
Recently, Indias badminton film Kidambi Srikanth won the open competition in Indonesia and enhanced the pride of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his trainees for this victory.
A few days ago, I would run away.
T.
Usha had the opportunity to attend the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more we encourage sports and sports.
Sports plays an important role in individual development.
The importance of sports in the development of the inclusive personality is unusual.
There is no shortage of talented players in the country.
If the children of our family have sports, they have to give them opportunities.
Taking them out of the ground and closing them in the room , should not be practiced for practice .
They should also study, even if they can show a bright performance, but if they have their lives in sports, they should be encouraged by schools, colleges, family and surrounding people.
Everyone has to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the summer of this year.
But the rains are waiting.
Today, while talking to you, the holy month of Ramadan has begun.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan.
There is a lot of importance for prayers, spirituality and charity in Ramadan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can proudly proudly, we can proudly proudly say that all the communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and also those who deny God.
There are also people worshipping idols and also those who oppose idol worshipping .
Every kind of ideals, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition is here and we have done the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion or community or be it tradition, all these things give us a message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramadan will definitely help in taking this path of peace, unity and harmony forward.
I once again extend my best wishes to everyone.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to this.
Individually, everyone has shown me the zeal of talking about our minds.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not heard everybody's message, so many things have come.
But when we look at these messages, some people have tried to learn music, some people are trying to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube.
Some people are learning arts, some are learning dances, some are learning dramatics.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Some people are trying to understand the nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I want to hear you a phone call.
"I speak a simple word.
When I had to save myself from the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be made to gain independence, how many sacrifices have been made by the freedom fighters.
I was very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to the new generation.
I am happy that the younger generation is keen to know about their history, about our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their lives in the tricolor for freedom, many young people climbed on the throne of Fashi.
Whether it is not so, and that is why today we breathe in independent India.
We must have seen that in the freedom movement, the great men who had enjoyed time in Turang, had done a great job of writing, study and their writings also strengthened India's independence.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar a long time ago.
He had also gone to see the cellular jail there .
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book My Birth Anthem in Turunga.
He used to write poems and write on the walls.
They were locked in a small pocket.
How should they have suffered the punishment of freedom.
When I read Savarkar's 'My Birth Anniversary' book, I got the inspiration to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound lighting programme which is very inspiring.
There is no such state in India, there is no language group in India in which nobody has been punished for the freedom of black money in the tricolor of Andaman and the cellular tricolor.
Every language speaker, every region, every generation has suffered this torture, today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi often used to say - One must come out of a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we do not see.
Open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe in the fresh air and get a new consciousness.
When our body is connected to the Panchmahas, there is a new consciousness in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this, but we don't take care of it, we don't bind it in a thread or in a thread.
And you must see that when our natural conditions are connected then there will be a new consciousness within us.
And that is why the global mission to connect with the nature of June 5 should be its own mission.
We are getting some benefits from our ancestors protecting the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then the future generations will benefit from it.
And if we see a student then it is the largest guiding scripture of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Bhumi: The sons of Ahm Prithvia, said to us.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity of ours is due to the earth.
The earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, it is certainly a matter of fact that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had taken place under the tree.
But in modern terms, it needs to be linked to modern waves.
Through Yoga, we have linked the world to a thread.
Just as Yoga connects the body, mind, intellect and soul, it is bringing together today.
Today's lifestyle has become difficult to live without stress due to the growing obligations.
It has been seen that this stressful situation has occurred even from a young age .
It may be that he used to take medicines and used to cover the day, in such a situation, Yoga has an important role in living a stress-free life.
Yoga is a way of guarantee to achieve health and strength.
Yoga is not just exercise.
If you have to take an interaction with the health of the body and the thoughts and ideas then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to the governments and all the leaders of the world.
Last year, I have announced some of the competitions related to yoga and have announced some aspirations.
Gradually work will be done in that direction.
I have received an information and I congratulate those who reflect this precious idea.
There is a very interesting information.
He added that this is the third International Day of Yoga here and for that, you must urge the three generations of the family to do yoga together.
All three generations of Azi-Azoba, parents, daughter-in-law should do yoga asanas together and upload their photographs.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be a beautiful milestone that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful to you for suggesting this imagination and I also feel that just as we had launched the Selfie with Daughter and had a very interesting experience, these three generations will be able to commend the photographs of yoga in the country and the world.
You must send a collective picture of those three generations where three generations of yoga are performing.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be the photographs that will ensure the golden future.
I am inviting you.
International Yoga Day is still a three-week period.
In a way this immune system is the only movement for health conservation .
I invite all of you to participate in this.
When you gave me the responsibility of your chief servant, when I got the opportunity to speak from the Red Fort on 15th August of my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, I have come to know that my journey is going on from different parts of India and what Modi is doing, where Modi is going and what Modi has done.
The reason for this was that I had received a very careful telephone and I had never thought of what he said.
But I am grateful to him for bringing this in mind.
You also listen to this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am talking to Naina from Mumbai.
I have always seen Modi ji on TV and social media that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively taken Swachhta as a mission according to your request.
Old people have participated in this but children have also been aware of cleanliness.
Children often seem to be stopping the roads from wasting the roads.
The Swachhata Mission that you had started from Kashi Ghats took the form of a movement with your inspiration.
Your statement is true that wherever I go, government machinery does not only work for cleanliness but recently it is also seen celebrating Swachhta in society.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, a large number of cleanliness programmes were organized ten days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a very big Swachhata Mission.
But I didn't know about these two things.
But after this telephone, I have thought that this thing is true.
You can imagine how happy I have been with this thing in mind and the country is also taking care of this thing.
Is it a matter of joy that cleanliness is linked to my visits
There is a habit of preparing the rest for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but sanitation has become a major factor in it.
This thing is pleasant and inspiring for anyone who loves cleanliness.
It is very good, but I have to consider it.
However, it is true that this movement should be standing and it is a good thing to visit the Amuk tonne waste from the Swachhta Mission, instead of giving some memories and memories.
It will be such a great humanity.
Once we started accepting this waste as wealth, many new methods of waste management will come before us.
Youngsters associated with Start-ups will also bring new schemes and innovations.
The Government of India has decided to open a big campaign for waste management with the help of peoples representatives of the cities with the help of the State Governments.
On June 5, on the World Environment Day, about four thousand cities will have dense waste and liquid waste tools.
Two types of wastes will be provided, one of them will be green and the other will be blue.
Two types of wastes are made - one wet waste and the other dry waste .
These wastes will be kept in four thousand cities and wear dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste in compliance with the discipline.
For example, the waste that comes out of the kitchen, the vegetables, the remaining food, the eggs, the skin of the eggs, it is all wet waste and it should be put in green colored waste.
The other types of wastes include rod papers, pearls, iron, glasses, cloths, plastics, polythenes, broken dungs, rubber and metals and all these are dry wastes.
I am sure that we will develop a culture and we will have to take a new step towards cleanliness and we will be able to fulfil the dreams of Gandhijis dream of cleanliness.
Today, I am proud to mention one thing that even if only one person decides to do so, he can create a big mass movement.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
The people of Versova sea shores have been transformed by working hard for about 80-90 weeks. Thousands of tons of waste waste was washed and then somewhere today Versova beach became clean and beautiful.
The entire responsibility of this work was taken by Versova Residence Volunteer (VRV).
Brothers and sisters, I have been told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the region of Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the regional block and the administrators of Jammu and Kashmir for their best examples.
And I have also been told that the leaders of this entire movement were women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He motivated people from households and streets to get inspired.
I heartily congratulate those mothers and sisters, and congratulate the administrators there who have made a block free of open defecation on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, three years of the present government has been reviewed from newspapers, TV channels and social media since the last month and half.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
This three-year tenure has been undertaken on every town.
People from every section of the society have analyzed it.
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, I believe that all these things are important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given ideological and important reactions.
If there is a light on errors and deficiencies then there is an opportunity to improve it.
This rotation is very important for an aware nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and a good white affects me as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It feels like I am talking about the things that I am sitting in the house and in the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, if you meet again, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will come, the students will start their life and a new joy and fresh fragrance will come along with the arrival of rains.
Let us all move forward in such an environment in love with nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, there are innumerable contributions to the society, on the other hand, often the government should not be seen.
The information that comes to Mann Ki Baat every time was a detailed analysis in the government.
What are the types of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that the nature of man is to consult others .
If someone gets coughing by going to the bus, then he comes and tells him that he should do this.
To give advice, to inform, it is in our nature.
Most of the information providers are those people who are trying to reach me, who actually do something in their lives.
He used to make efforts to improve his mind, strength, capability and conditions and when he remembered this thing, I felt that this is not a simple information, it is a word of experience.
Some people also do information because they feel that if they listen to the ideas where they are working then they can benefit many people if they get a comprehensive form.
And that is why their natural desire is to mention it in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive in my view.
First of all, I express my gratitude to all those who have done something or the other for the workforce.
Not only this, when I mention something then it is very happy to remember something like this.
Last time some people had informed me about Mann Ki Baat and expressed concern about food being used and I had mentioned it.
And when mentioned, on the Narendra Modi App, many people from every corner of the country used to use innovative ideas to prevent food being used.
I have never thought that today, especially younger generations have been working in our country for several years.
We have heard that some social institutions are doing this for the last few years, but I later understood that the youth of my country are participating in this work.
Many have sent a video to me.
There are many places where the bank of the ships is going on.
In the bank of these ships, people collect their poultry, collect vegetables and take the required people from there.
The bearer also gets satisfaction and the eater does not feel unreasonable.
This is an example of how the work is done with the help of society.
Today the month of April is being completed and the last day is.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra are being set up on 1st May.
I extend my best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have been constantly trying to enhance the developmental summits.
The country has contributed to the progress of the country and inspired the lives of the great men in every field of the society and in the memory of these great men, we should resolve to take our state, our society, our city and our family to the place of the state, the year 2022 and the 75th year of independence.
We have to plan to take the resolution and move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has changed all the rules of sports.
The summer in our country in May-June has driven the desire to experience here in March-April.
And when I was taking information on Mann Ki Baat, people have been informed about what to do during the summer.
s.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern over birds .
He said that in the weekend, water should be kept on the threshold and I have seen that small children from the family do this work very interestingly.
Once they came to know why they used to fill the water 10 times a day and see whether the vessels were kept in it were water or not and whether the birds came or not.
We feel that this is his game, but indeed it is a unique experience to awaken this sensitivity in the minds of small children.
Sometimes you also see a little bit of animals and birds feel a new joy.
A few days ago, I have sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows, and they have expressed concern over the number of chimneys that are decreasing, but what they have tried to protect them in the form of a campaign.
Though we are coloured with them in our country, animals and nature, it is important to strengthen such efforts in a collective manner.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I had completed a hundred years to the religious leader of Daudhi Bohra Samaj.
He lived 103 years.
And on his hundredth day, the Bohra community had launched a very big campaign to save the smoke from the slaughterhouse.
I had the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He distributed about 52 thousand Burd feeders to every corner of the world.
He has got a place in the Guinness Book of World Writers.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are so busy with newspapers, milk-payers, vegetables, postmans, but we forget that the days of summer are so much that they should think about the water.
Young friends, I am going to beat you too.
Sometimes I am sure that many of our younger generations have the pleasure of spending a comfortable life.
Parents also keep sexing them in a defense condition .
There are also some other ends, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the examinations have been completed and plans have been made to enjoy the holidays.
Though summer leaves , summers are slightly good .
But as a friend, I have to say something about how to take your vacation.
I am sure some people will definitely use and tell me.
If you utilize this holiday, I offer three of them, then it is very good, but try to do one of the three.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes there is a difference between seeing something on TV or reading in book or listening to the acquaintances and feeling that thing on its own .
Experiments should be positive and should be taken out of comfortable tendencies.
We are from the middle class and are from the happy family.
I don't want to say that once again, do it.
In the evening, take your football, take a volleyball or take a sports literature and go to a poor village.
You must have played with those poor children, you must have seen that you have never had the pleasure of sports in your life before.
You have ever thought about how big changes will happen in the lives of those children who have lived such a life in the society.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel like going back again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs continue to work in service.
Sometimes there are very summer camps .
Personality is of development, of a variety of developments and can participate in it.
But at the same time, you will feel that you have done such a summer schedule, have done a philosophy of personality development, you have reached the people of the society who have not received such a chance and have learnt what you have learned.
How to do, you can teach them.
I also appreciate the fact that technology has come to reduce the gap and has come to end the technological boundaries.
Everybody is busy with technology on the other hand.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing, the idea of doing something is a good thing and it is also important to do it.
But also see whether the human elements that are inside us are not cut off or not, we are not far away from human qualities.
Is this a little focus on skill development
Try to spend time with yourself, away from technology.
You have learnt about 5-50 texts in a new language, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
And if we look at the variety of countries, we can find somebody teaching around us.
If you don't swim, learn swimming, take pictures, don't get a better picture but try to put somebody on paper.
The sensitivity within you will have to be expressed.
Sometimes we used to learn small things which we say - why not want.
You will see all these new experiments, this skill will also give you happiness and will not expel you from the fact that life has been built in a post.
Friends, Do something outside the chocolate.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you are wondering if all the exams are over, if you go to the new stages of work then you will not get the opportunity.
And that's why I tell you that if you want to learn magic then learn the magic of women.
Keep on showing magic to our friends and sisters.
Try to know what you don't know, it will definitely benefit you.
The human power within you will be conscious and it will be a great opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that we cannot imagine how much we get to learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new campuses.
Three days, four days after going to one place.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days and four days.
You will get to learn a lot from this.
When you go, you must send me photographs there.
Have you seen a new one
Where are you going
You can tell your experiences by using Hash-Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a lot of opportunity.
New generations are getting almost free from illiteracy.
You can also earn from this scheme. You have thought about it.
The government of India has a plan.
If you are downloading the BHIM App, you are also using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get it done by 20 people throughout the day then you can earn 200 rupees by the evening.
Professionals can also earn and students can also earn.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
Your contribution will be in building a Digital India.
In a way, he became a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience was saying that the red lamp was on the vehicle, it was on the train, but gradually it was rotating in the head and this VIP culture was deepened in the head.
Now only the red light has gone, so nobody can claim that the red light that has rolled in the head has come out.
I have received a very interesting telephone.
He has expressed his gratitude in this telephone but this time this telephone shows so much that the common man does not like this.
He feels a kind of incapableness in it.
I am speaking Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I have read a summary in the newspaper, in which I am very proud to hear the ever-Indian Is a VIP on a road, and I am happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to stop traffic and I don't want to stay for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to thank you all for this decision.
Going to Lal Divya through government decisions is also a part of the system.
But we have to take it out of our minds as well.
If we all try to get awakened together then we can get rid of it.
The idea of New India is to increase the importance of EPI instead of VIP in the country and when I call EPI instead of VIP, my feelings are clear.
Every person has the importance, every person has the importance.
If we acknowledge the importance of 1. 25 billion Indians, we have accepted the importance of 125 crore Indians then how much power will be able to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I often say that we recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of 125 crore Indians and saints of the country.
Because of some reason we were so obstacles that we were so small that we were thinking for centuries.
The centuries will be very important for other countries around the world.
But India is such ancient country that we have got the opportunity to remind us of thousands of years and even thousands of years old.
Just imagine.
Even today, how many complications come to the forefront of breaking the social customs.
How about a thousand years ago
He himself had done it to those who were considered untouchables by his conduct.
Thousands of years ago, he had called for the entry of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate to have been born from our society to destroy the bad practices of our society in every age.
While celebrating a thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, we must inspire him to awaken this spirit for social integrity.
The Government of India will also release a postal stamp on the memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji and pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance of tomorrow's 1st May.
In many parts of the world, it is also celebrated as Workers' Day.
And when there was talk of labour and labour, when there was talk of labour, it is natural for me to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people will be aware that we are grateful to Babasaheb for the benefits that the workers have received.
Babasahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, about Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of Karnataka in the 12th century, Guru Basweshwar ji.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to go to a function.
He was a programme to dedicate to the nation.
In Kannada language, he said, "Whoever calas" means that you can achieve the calamity of Lord Shankar's house by your mind, that is, by doing work heaven.
In other words, this is Shiva.
I have been talking about Shree Jaite again and again.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thangdi after that.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world .
The ideas of Buddha are very relevant when the world is facing the problems, violence, war, destruction and hostility.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent symbol of this journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that this great festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated on behalf of the United Nations.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get a chance to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will be bright.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and relevant facilities of the satellite will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
This is an exemplary example of our commitment to South Asia.
Most of the families in the country will be in the examination of their children.
There will be a slight stress-free environment and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be some tension in those houses.
But this time, I would like to say that the last time I had told the students about Mann Ki Baat again.
During the examination, we will certainly be useful.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Wang-Bhoo.
Today, on this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence. And I wish that Bangladesh should grow, develop and believe that India is a partner of Bangladesh.
We are a good friend and we will continue to join us in peace, security and development in the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory is our collective heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the construction of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first ASEAN person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British gave him a nighthood.
When British killed the citizens in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Ravindranath Tagore was one of those great men who raised their voices against this destruction.
This was the time when this incident had a unique impact on the minds of a child of 12 years of age.
In adolescents, the smiling in the fields, the smiling in the plantations, the destruction of the Jallianwala Bagh had given a new impetus to life.
In 1919, the boys of 12 years of age, i. e.
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagatsingh ji, his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru were attacked by the British and we know all about the destruction of March 23.
On the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the service of Bharat Mata was satisfactory at that time, there was no fear of death.
He had sacrificed the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still inspiration for us.
The words of the sacrifices of Bhagtsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be incomplete.
Just a few days ago, I had the opportunity to go to that place and I felt that there are special skeletons on that land and I told the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to visit Punjab then you must go to the tomb of Bhagatsingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagatsingh, Matoshree and Batukeshwar Datta.
This was the time when the blessings of independence, its intensity and business was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagtsingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhijis ideas and Gandhis style were clearly seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was an important turning point in the entire journey of independence, especially in the context of the struggle.
This was the time when the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the end of the mill workers in Ahmedabad and the ideas and functioning of the Mahatma Gandhiji.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha.
Imagine that a person returns to India in 1915 and only two years of work.
The country did not know them, they did not have any effect.
You can imagine how hard they have had to bear and how hard they have to bear.
Champaran Satyagraha was such an event in which the organization of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to identify the nerves of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, to organise the poorest of the poor and the uneducated people against the British politics, to inspire them to fight.
We could learn from them and the time was that the big leaders whom we hear, Gandhiji, that time, that Acharya Kripalani had sent everyone to the threshold.
And the British did not know what is the way Gandhiji's work was done, the struggle was being done and the innovation was also happening.
One side was conflict and the other was production.
On the one hand, he used to bow down to the prisoner and on the other hand in the construction work.
This is the reason why the foundation stone of New India is going to be laid.
New India is not a government program or a political party.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who often go to the hospital, serve patients, many people who run for blood if needed.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry.
Our country is multi-pronged.
People's service, that is, the Lord's service is divided into our vessels.
If we look at it in a collective manner, in an organised form, it is such a great strength.
If every citizen decides that I will follow the rules of transport, if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol-diesel for one day in a week.
You will see, the dreams of New India and the dreams of 125 crore people of this country will be fulfilled before our eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his religion, follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude today.
In the last few days, there has been an atmosphere in our country that people have participated in digital payments and digital movements.
Different types of digital payments have been observed after demonetization.
BHIMP has been started only for two to two and a half months, but so far about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to fight against black money and corruption.
Would 1. 25 billion Indians resolve to transmit 2. 5 billion digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
It is not necessary for 1. 25 billion people to wait for one year if they take care of this thing.
This work can be done in six months.
Two and a half thousand crore digital transactions, if you are going to fill the school then you will not be able to fill it in a digital manner and you will make a digital payment in the journey of the train.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several Digidhan Melas were organised for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolution of 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programs have been organized.
There were also twenty-two schemes.
Approximately 1. 25 lakh people have got twenty-five in the fortunate consumer scheme.
70 thousand entrepreneurs have received their blessings .
On the occasion of the completion of 100 days, a big event will be held at the end.
There is a large settlement system.
I am confident that in the days we are in our hands for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti, we will propagate Bhima.
Let us join in reducing cash and reducing the use of boats.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to say that whenever I ask the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several kinds of information, but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time.
Honble Prime Minister, my Namaskar, first of all, I congratulate you that you have won in these elections.
I want to talk to you about my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness.
Everyday I go through the river where most people pollut the river by putting garbage in large quantities .
This river flows from the Rispna bridge and also comes to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a new paper.
Brothers and sisters, Look how difficult the girl who is learning in the course of the course is.
How much anger is there on seeing the garbage in the river .
I consider this a good symptom.
I want to create a tricolor in the minds of 1. 25 billion people.
Since the Swachhata Abhiyan has started, people have become aware.
Everybody has been positively linked to it.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
The issue of dirt is increasing.
Be aware, enhance active participation, it has a different significance.
But sanitation is more related to habits than movements.
This movement is a movement to change the habits and to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can be in a collective form.
It is difficult to work but to do it.
I am confident that the spirit that has emerged among the new generations, children, students and youth of the country will automatically indicate good results.
Today, the message of guidance should be the message of the guide to the countrymen who are listening to the guides from Mann Ki Baat.
Have we ever thought that how much we destroy this raw food that we put in.
Have you ever thought that if you don't spend the food then how many poor people can fill the stomach in it.
This is not a subject that has to be explained.
When the mother increases the food in her house then she says that the child should be as much as she wants.
Some or the other efforts are being made, but the apathy about this is a social treason.
This is injustice to the poor.
The second issue is that if you get saved then the family will get economic benefits.
I don't want to speak much about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youngsters who run such campaigns.
He has prepared a mobile page.
Wherever this kind of food is eaten or left, they speak to other people and use that food properly.
Youth of our country are doing such a thing.
We will find such people in every state of India.
Their lives also inspire us not to spend food and increase food as much as they want.
Those people who are aware of health often say that they should keep their stomach a little empty.
I would like to tell the people of the country that sadness is not an impossible disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and then the treatment starts.
Its first mantra is to become open instead of pressing the emotionality.
Openly tell your colleagues, friends, parents and teachers, what are you doing
Sometimes the problem of loneliness occurs more in the students living in the hospital .
They don't come to the food table.
Have you ever noticed why he does this
We know that this is the first step towards sadness.
If he is avoiding living with a common family, if he is going to a single person then it will not happen.
Look at those people with whom he wants to openly.
Inspire him to express his smile and open his mind where he has smiled.
This is the best way.
Disappointment can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all the diseases, it destroys the optimisticity of fighting, adventure, decision making and destroys this capacity.
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from coming to anxiety.
There is another way.
If we cannot open to the people near you, do one thing, go to such a place where the work of service is going on.
If we try to understand their grief with service then there will be a new confidence in our minds.
By connecting with others, by serving and serving anybody with selflessness, the stress of mind is easily lightened.
If seen then Yoga is also a good way to keep mind healthy .
Yoga is very useful for elimination of stress , liberation of depression and joyfulness .
June 21 is the International Yoga Day.
We should also be prepared from now on and celebrate the collective Yoga Festival in lakhs.
If you want to inform us about Yoga Day, then you should guide me through my mobile application.
We can make songs and poems about Yoga so that this topic can be reached easily.
However, in the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is certainly a welcome thing that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He takes care of the responsibility of the family and also has the economic responsibility of the household and sometimes it becomes injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
The women employed during delivery, during pregnancy, mother Raza, who had already received 12 weeks, will now be given 26 weeks.
Two or three countries in the world are ahead of us in this regard.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
Its original objective should be to take care of the newborn who is the future citizen of India.
He was taken care of infant conditions, if he got mother's love then this child would be the glory of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and therefore this important decision will benefit about 18 lakh women.
Let us get inspiration from the lives of all these great men, let us get the strength to resolve for New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla is a republic, I extend my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
It is time for the farmers to start making pieces after the spring season and the fruits of their meritoriousness to come in hand .
New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country.
The New Year is welcomed in Gujarat, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanatsar Puja in Awadh region, Jude-Seetal in Mithila region of Bihar, Satwani in Magadh region.
India is a multi-dimensional country.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on this new year.
Thanks a lot.
The winter is over now.
Spring has entered the life of all of us .
Besides the fruits of the summer season , amla peacocks are seen in spring itself .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of peacocks in the fields revive the minds of the farmers.
The dry flowers of pulses indicate that the Holi has come.
Amir Khusro has described this change in nature as a fun moment.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Fool-ridden mustards are gross, Ambava feet, Tesu flowers, coal speaks, Dr.
When nature is happy, the environment is pleasant then man also enjoys this season.
The festival of Vasanta Panchami , Mahashivaratri and Holi fills the heart of the human life.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to end the last month of Falgun and are ready to welcome the coming Chaitra month.
The confluence of spring meaning this is the confluence of two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for this thing that before Mann Ki Baat, whenever I ask for a detail from you, there is a lot of information from me.
I am grateful to all of you for recalling this honourable achievement of India.
Be it poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge, information, technology, science have underlined its importance.
15 February, 2017 is a glorious day for Indias life.
Our scientists have raised India's mind in front of the world and all of you know that ISRO has successfully completed several missions in the last few years.
In the last few days, ISRO has set up a global record in the space sector after successful launch of the Mongol Satellite under Mars Mission.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for a common nation.
ISRO's Coast Effective Ifficient Space Program has become a wonder for the world and the world has also openly appreciated the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important, Cartosat-2D is the satellite of India and this satellite will be used for photographs, information, maping, infrastructure development facilities, development information and urban development planning.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water bodies are there in the country, how can they be used
It is also a matter of satisfaction for us that our young scientists , our female scientists led this kind of campaign .
The great participation of youngsters and women is a great pride in ISRO's success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the people of the country.
These scientists have sustained the use of space science for the service of the nation for the common man and they are recording new records.
No matter how much we congratulate our scientists and their teams, it will be less.
The scientists of India have shown this.
The capability of this area is that even from a distance of 2000 kms, if there is an area to attack India then this area will destroy it in the space.
When we see a new technologies and a new scientific research, we are happy.
He does not get healthy until he gets the same answer.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human excitement then we can say that this development journey is no longer complete.
New science, new technologies are created by it and every technologies give birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs several scientists.
Todays scientists can become a cause for a sustainable change in the lives of generations in the coming days.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a different kind of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful research was invited.
Sometimes, to find out the answers, the problem recalls the importance of science.
In 2005, there was an extreme rain in Mumbai, there was a flood in the ocean and there were many difficulties.
Whenever there is a natural crisis, the crisis comes on the poor.
The two people worked in this regard and developed a way of housing which will save the household during such a crisis, save the residents of the house, save the water from coming home and save the diseases caused by polluted water.
Mechanisms are also being implemented.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in the burden of DG-Dhan.
In particular, younger generations have a habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe this is a good symptom.
In the last few days, the lucky consumer scheme and the Digi-Dhan Merchant Yojana have got a good support in our country.
About two months, 15 thousand people are getting Rs. 1000 per day.
Through these two schemes, we are welcomed all over the country with the objective of creating a mass movement for digital payment in India.
It is a matter of great pleasure that under the DG-Dhan Yojana, 10 lakh people have got twenty-five, more than fifty thousand businessmen have got the reward and more than Rs.
There are more than a hundred consumers in this scheme who have received one lakh rupees in the form of a reward.
There are four thousand traders who have received Rs. 50-15 thousand twenty-five.
Mr. Santosh, from Mysore, has written on the Narendra Modi App that he has received a prize of Rs. 1,000 in the fortunate consumer scheme.
But I think he has written an important thing to reach you.
He has written that when he got the blessings of one thousand rupees, he came to know that a poor woman's house had been set on fire and all the things were burnt in the fire.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am delighted to be here.
We have done a very inspirational job.
Brother Sabir, a 20-year-old worker in Delhi, has now been associated with digital transactions and he has got Rs. 1 lakh in the fortunate consumer scheme of the government.
A young student from Maharashtra, Puja Namade, post-pursuit courses, and how is the use of RuPay cards and e-wallets in his family and how much joy he gets in doing.
One lakh rupees are important for them, but they have taken this task as a gift and they are also connecting others with it.
This movement has a very strong role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everybody associated with this work is an anti-corruption cadre and anti-corruption party of the country.
In a way, you are a Chinese soldier.
On April 14, a large amount of Rs.
There are about forty-four days of childhood .
Remembering them, we must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Learn how it was exchanged.
In particular, teach those small and medium traders who are around you.
Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary and Bhima App, give it special importance.
And that is why I want to say that we have to strengthen the foundation of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Going home, connecting everyone and reaching BHIM App up to 125 crore hands.
The movement that has been launched for the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in many cities and towns.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has played a big role in the root cause of our economy.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmers brothers and sisters, they are filled with cereal warehouses with hard work.
This year, the farmers of our country have been able to produce record production.
The total number of records are saying that our farmers have brought all the previous records in Modi.
This year there has been a crop in the field that it seems every day that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
These eight pieces are more than the previous records in the name of our farmers.
This itself is an unprecedented success.
I particularly thank the farmers of the country.
I also thank you for taking the production of pulses by considering the poor in the country as well as the traditional crops, because the poor get the most protein from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor and have planted different pulses in about two and a half lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but is a great service to the poor in my country by the farmers.
I have a request, there is a prayer, my farmers are eligible for special thanks to my brothers and sisters.
My dear countrymen, some or the other initiatives are being undertaken by the government in our country, from the society, from the institutions, from the organisations, from everybody to cleanliness.
In a way, everyone seems to be aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government is also constantly making efforts.
A few days ago, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments under the leadership of our Secretaries of the Government of India, under the leadership of the Drinking Water and Cleanliness Department was held in Telangana.
What is the significance of the work of direct hygiene not only in the closed rooms of the state of Telangana
Using this on 17 and 18 February a toilet pitting exercise was organised in Hyderabad .
The toilet pits of six houses were cleaned and the officers themselves showed that the pits used by the Twin Pit Toilets could be used empty and used again.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets built by using these new technologies, and there is no difficulty in pursuing the vacancies, there is no hesitation, no mental obstacles.
The way we clean the others and clean the pit of a toilet.
And this is the sanitation of the toilet which we consider as a fertilizer and it is black gold in a way.
We can see how wealth is being created from waste to health.
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet for the family of six people, this model takes place in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and left in another segment.
In six to twelve months, the waste stored in the pothole was disintegrated.
Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are full of nutrients and are considered to be very good fertilizers in the field of agriculture.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now a special Swachhta Archives programme has been started on television.
It will benefit as much as possible.
Different departments of the government organise Swachhata Pandharvada regularly.
On the second day of March, the Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are convinced that whenever any citizen of our country does something good then the entire country feels a new energy and confidence is increasing.
We welcomed the achievements made by our Divyang Sportspersons in Rio Para Olympics.
The country is proud of the success of these disabled colleagues.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, brave and committed.
Every moment we can learn something or the other from them.
The issue of sports or space science is not behind anybody in our country.
A few days ago, our women's association has won silver medals in the Asian Ragbi Sevents Trophy competition.
I extend my best wishes to all these players.
Womens Day is celebrated in the world on 8th March.
In order to give importance to girls in India, there should be an increase in awareness about them in family and society, sensitivity should be increased.
The 'Mulgi Save-Mulgi Learning' Mission is going on at a fast pace.
Today this was not just a government programme.
Today, it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, this initiative has been linked to the common man.
This initiative has participated in considering the brighter issues in every corner of the country.
The ideas of people have changed about the old customs that have been going on for years.
Whenever the news of the festival is celebrated after the birth of the girl, it is very happy.
In a way, positive ideas about girls are becoming the cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kundlore district has imposed a ban on child marriage under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the 'Mulgi Save-Mulgi Leading' scheme and there is a lot of effort from the district administration to ensure that orphan girls donate and get education.
In Madhya Pradesh, the programme of 'Har Ghar Dastak' is going on for rural and domestic girls.
In Rajasthan, initiatives are being taken to inspire the girls who have left the school by running 'Apna Bacha, Apna Vidyalaya' campaign and to bring them back to school.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed as per local requirements.
When we celebrate the Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling - Women, those powers, those women, those who are the women of India, those who do not work, those who are equally empowered.
We were also actively participating.
I am extremely grateful for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
This festival, which recalls the commitment of the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and their commitment to democracy, is a festival that will create a democratic edition on the future generations and awakening the responsibility of pursuing democracy.
But the more we have to discuss the rights and duties of the citizens in our country, the more we have to discuss.
I hope that at every level, the importance of the rights should be given as important duties as well.
On this day, at 11 a.m., we pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country.
On January 30, at 11 a.m., it should be a two-minute shutdown as a society and become a country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who were honoured with different bravery awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Special Service Medal and Special Service Medal.
I specially inspire the youth of the country and you are very active on social media.
Can you do a job This time you will find out about the heroes who have received this honor and bring them to your friends by writing two good words about them.
When we go deeply and inform them about the bravery of these heroes and their bravery, we feel surprised, pride and inspiration.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of the 26th January being celebrated all over the country, while in order to protect the borders of our country in Kashmir, the soldiers had to lose their lives due to snowfall.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are aware of the fact that I keep telling you my Mann Ki Baat continuously.
January, February, March and April are all months, that is, every family has a long time.
Nearly every household has a test of one or two children but all the families used to be buried under the examination.
I feel that this is the time for my students to interact with friends, their parents and teachers, because for many years wherever I go, wherever I visit, the tests of the children are being done.
The family is worried, the students are taking care of, the teachers are in discourse, such a strange mental situation has been created in every household.
When I was going to talk about this thing then many teachers, parents, students sent me messages, sent questions, sent some information, the problems that we face.
I want to express the ideas that have come in my mind by reading all these things.
I got a telephone message from the world.
Sir, I would like to tell you that during the examination days, there was a very terrible atmosphere in our houses, neighbours and society.
That is why not only does the minds of the students get ready but we also become sad.
I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere cannot be pleasant
The question is true, but it will emerge in the minds of all of us.
There are very few people who are seen in the examination.
Most of them were tests.
It is a preservation that you have to make a decision on Please.
The pleasure and joy that will be faced by this exam will get the same sweet fruits and the pressure that will hurl it will come to the later stage.
Therefore, I believe that you are going to meet the exams as if it was a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play an important role in fulfilling this festival.
On seeing the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, all these tests are conducted in three to four months.
These three-four months, according to your traditions, change the environment of your family in accordance with the festival.
And that's why I would like to tell you, a little more, a little more.
In a stressful situation, all the doors are closed and nothing can go inside and the intestines cannot come out.
The way the idea process stops and these things are loaded.
And you don't have knowledge, there is a lack of information, where do you have a lack of mind
But when there is tension then your knowledge and information about you gets stuck under it and the tension is sounded on it.
It is important to keep in mind the 'A Happy Mind is the sign for a good mark-sheat'.
Sometimes it seems that we don't look at the examination from the right perspective.
It is our mindset that there should be a question of living and die.
This exam will be about what you have done throughout the year.
Your entire livelihood will not take place there.
This is not an exam about how you have lived, how you have lived and how you have lived ahead.
Besides the tests given in the classroom, you have gone through several episodes.
The former President of India, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge I see in today's era is to become an educational testing centre.
Marks are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also the stress on the minds of the students has increased.
I want to know about the current trend of education and your views on the future.
In fact, he has answered his question, but Richa wants me to tell some of my opinions on this subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and qualities.
If you believe in this thing then Mark will come back from yourself and you will never need to run away from them.
You will be able to use knowledge in your life, your story will be useful, self-confidence and determination will be used.
When you go to a lawyer to fight your bigger conflict, would you see its mark sheet
These things are seen in the field of experience, knowledge and acquaintance.
That is why the attacks sometimes stop us from going towards the right direction .
Richaji has also raised the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a very big mental battle.
It is easier to understand the examples related to sports.
Most of the successful sportspersons used to have their own competition.
Let us take these examples of Sachin Tendulkar.
Her journey has been going on for twenty years, and he knows that he has been defeating himself.
It should be a miracle because he followed the path of competition in comparison to others.
In every field of AYUSH, you should have asked yourself this question about experiments and I could have done two hours quietly before, why should I have a three-hour exercise
Is it too late to wake up early in the morning
Is there no sleep because of the stress of the examination
He further said, My mother did not have much learned.
However, he used to sit with me and had to leave maths.
I only tell the parents that they should focus on three things, acceptances, teachings and time.
The parents must have experienced that the expectations from their teachers and their children are the roots of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask any question about the health of the patient.
He came and started listening to Vinodi jokes.
Within four-five minutes, the entire atmosphere was cleared.
Ervi keeps talking about the diseases that are going to meet the patient and scares him .
I want to tell my parents that sometimes we are aware of the fact that we are with children.
Did we ever think that during the examinations we should give the child a joyful, smiling environment
So see, the atmosphere will change.
I have received another big telephone call.
He said, Namaskar Pradhan Mantri, I cannot tell myself because my childhood has done the same thing.
I had tried to copy my childhood.
And when I tried to make a direct copy, it was also captured, I had suffered a lot from many friends around me.
These are the streets of shortcut which become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this several times.
I would like to say that again.
If seen in any way then the ill effects of copying will be seen .
If the same creativity spends the same time on the subject of examination then perhaps it will not be necessary to copy.
A phone call has come to me, he says, "Namaskar, Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I am a 12th student, so I want to ask you some questions related to board exams.
My first question is about increasing stress during these tests, how can it be reduced
In the days of examination, if I talk about playing and reading then your teacher, your parents will come to me.
How are the Prime Ministers who tell children to play during the examination
Because in sports we have a common understanding that the focus on studies is decreasing.
This idea is basically wrong.
The only problem is there .
Look at the sky, see the trees of the neighbourhood, slightly lighten your mind and then sit in your rooms.
Whether it is for five minutes but give this rest time to yourself .
You will see that the work is getting more smooth.
Whether everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me the same.
For this there is no need to sit in the room .
If you are standing under the open courtyard, go to the chatti, breathe for five minutes and then sit in the exercise.
Some people believe that if you wake late in the night then it will be very experimental .
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs .
Your efficiency will increase overall.
Whenever I go to the polls for the elections then sometimes my voice is sitting.
During such a meeting, I had come to visit a folk singer.
He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
But this does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously .
However, the people of your house will come to me.
This is a very thick medicine to keep mind, mind and body aware.
Yes, young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of examinations and I am stuck in my mind.
Kunas Thakur, perhaps my speech will help in removing the stress of your mind.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not take care of what I have told you.
If you want to accumulate, don't do it, otherwise it will be a burden.
I have also told your parents that they should not bear the burden of expectations on children.
We must confront the exams by convincing our determination.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every corner of the country, give the form of a festival to that corner.
There will be no examination.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Ladies and gentlemen, on February 1, 2017, the 40th anniversary of the Indian Teacher Group is going to be completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and jawans of the Tarakshak Dal for their service to the nation.
Indian Coast Guard, along with 126 Self-made ships and 62 aircraft, is acknowledged to be the world's fourth largest coast Guard.
As per our ideal tactics, the soldiers of the television team are ready to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime areas of the country.
Last year, the Tatrakshak teams took the honourable task of making the beach of our country clean along with their responsibility.
Thousands of people had participated in it.
He is truly grateful for the safety of the coastal areas and for the sanitation of these beaches.
Very few people will be aware that not only men but women are also doing their obligations with their shoulders and successfully fulfilling their duties.
Our women officers of the Tatrakshak Dal are aviations, observers and are also taking over the responsibility of the attack.
Today, when the world-class security is a question of coastal security, I express my heartfelt congratulations on the 40th anniversary of the Indian coastal troop defence team to protect the coasts of India.
The Festival will be celebrated on 1st February.
It is considered to be the time of the introduction of the University.
Not only this, this is an inspirational time for the heroes.
The song 'Mera Rang de Basanti Chola' shows the same inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, while spreading Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also keeps on putting new colors in it with its imagination.
Mann Ki Baat gives you a great opportunity to connect with you.
I extend my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, my best wishes to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and sacrifice in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that if we don't want our bounty to the poor then we must accept it.
Saint Luke has written in Ganspel that Jesus has not only served the poor but has also praised the poor and it is really empowerment.
A story relating to this is very popular.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near a temple treasure .
Many people came and they donated a lot.
After that a poor widow came and she kept two copper copper coins in it.
If you go to see this then what is the value of two copper copper coins
The hearts of the devotees standing there were surprised .
Yessoon said that the widow has donated the most and the others have donated a lot, but this woman donated everything to her.
Recently, two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, where Malviya ji had a penance ground.
I laid the foundation stone of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU, Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country's dignity in the field of nuclear energy was also proud.
Whether it is a party leader, a member of Parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji has created an ideal in every field.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray for Gods good health.
As a worker, I had the privilege to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are woken up in front of my eyes today.
When I tweeted this morning, I also shared an old painting and I would certainly understand how Atal ji's affection would be in the form of a small worker.
Today, as a visit to the Nation, people of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn from each other and understand.
Today, the Central Governments Promotion Scheme for Consumers and Small Business is being launched to enhance the e-payment of mobile banking in order to enhance this process.
Fateful Consumer Yojana is a scheme to promote consumers, while Digi Dhan Business Yojana is a scheme to promote traders.
The scheme will start from today and the next 100 days will continue.
Every day 15,000 people will get Rs. 1,000 each.
In addition to this, one day will be left larger than a week for consumers in which lakhs of rupees will be levied and on 14th April, after three months, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar jis birth anniversary will be a gathering in which crores of rupees will be given.
The Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for businesses.
Professionals should automatically participate in the scheme and include consumers to prevent their behavior.
Independent arbitration will also be given to such professionals and these artisans will also be in thousands.
The businessmen will continue to have their own business and they will also get the opportunity to win forgiveness.
The scheme has been formulated by keeping all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class at the centre.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these baks.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods, sell goods, provide money and they can be beneficiaries of this scheme by using USSD.
In rural areas, AEPS can also buy and win fortnights.
30 crore citizens will soon participate in the Bakshad scheme.
It is easier to send the message as easily as we can through the Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments and online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The businessmen can surely guess how big this decision is.
The traders who will exchange digital routes, will provide online payments instead of cash in their operations, have been discounted from income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes and have started their implementation.
Someone told me that the Government of Assam has decided to pay 10 percent subsidy to the wealth tax and business permissible fees through digital payments.
The branches of rural banks, which will conduct at least two digital transactions from January to March by 75 of their consumers, will get Rs. 50,000 from the government.
He has also announced a leaflet of Rs. 5 lakh under the Best Panchayat for Digital Transactions by the Government to 100 Digital Transactions by March 31, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a return of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who have been fully filled with digital purchase of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Krishi Shiromani Yojana for farmers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all those who have taken such initiatives.
Several organizations have successfully experimented in promoting digital transactions among the poor farmers in the villages.
Someone told me that the companies related to Gujarat Narmada Khore, Fertilizer and Chemicals Fertilizers have set up POS machines wherever the fertilizers are sold for the convenience of the farmers.
It is a matter of fact that the sale of fertilizers of the company has increased by 27 this year compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, informal sectors have increased in our lifestyle and we are aware that most of these people are given money, money, money or wages, money and so that the labourers are exploited.
Wherever 100 rupees are required, 80 rupees are available.
At the same time, they are also entitled to the benefits of those benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easier for us.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have also made a lot of progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of the Digital Movement.
Our youngsters, with new ideas, with new technologies, can empower this sector in all possible ways.
At the same time, we must also participate in the campaign to free the country from time to time and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people to give their suggestions and suggestions before the Mann Ki Baat every month.
80 to 90 of the recommendations received on MyGov and Narendra Modi Power are related to the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all this, I distributed it in three parts.
Some people have written in detail about how people have to face difficulties and irregularities in the suggestions given to me.
The other kind of people have written that how good work is being done for the welfare of the country, even though such a sacred work is going on, where there is an unemployment and how new paths of corruption are being discovered.
Third kind of people have written that this fight will continue in support of what happened.
The number of people urging that corruption, black money should be completely destroyed and harder steps should be taken if needed.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have been sending a lot of letters and helping me.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has said that this step taken to completely stop the behavior of black money is worthy of commendation.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like the armed forces.
The words written on the notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the notes of two thousand will be canceled, the notes of 500 and 100 rupees will be canceled.
But the minds of the people of this country were stagnant by listening to all these words.
Not only this, many people have landed in the field, they have brought the true face of those who spread their lives using their skills and intellect, they have convinced that Afwa is wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
I also salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 1. 25 billion people are standing with you, nothing is impossible.
Jana Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for participating in this great event against corruption and black money.
I would like to have a comprehensive discussion on the fight against corruption and black money.
If the House had worked, there would have been good discussions.
Some people are spreading all kinds of concessions to the political parties, they are completely wrong.
The legislation is the same for all.
Be it individuals, or organisations or political parties, everybody should follow the law and everybody has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in finding the government's errors.
There was also a question of repeated changes in rules.
This government is for the people.
What power has been involved in this periodic behavior of dishonest and corruption for 70 years
When I decided to fight these people, they also started a new effort to defeat the government.
On the other hand, many citizens have also written letters about the non-trading and various aspects of the movement.
The public is giving more information than the information received from the government system.
Our success is being achieved due to general public awareness.
In order to provide such information, the government has prepared an e-mail address which can be sent to them.
I express my gratitude to all those who have written such letters and have faith in their letters and blessings.
This is not a complete break.
This is also the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping and for the work for which 125 crore people get blessings, there is no question of asking them.
We must have been aware that there is a law in terms of anonymous wealth in our country and this law was created in 1988.
He was kept in the bason.
We removed it and implemented the Effective Anonymous Property Act.
In the coming days, this law will show its impact.
We have been the highest priority to do what we have to do for the welfare of the people.
The report on World Banks Industry has improved Indias rankings.
India has jumped 32 places in the World Economic Forum's World Competitiveness Report.
In the Global Innovation Index 2016, we have jumped to 16 places and in 2016, we have jumped 19 places in the World Banks Internal Access Index.
The assessment of many reports is guiding such a way that India is moving faster.
My dear countrymen, this time, the session of the Parliament was destroyed by the citizens of the country.
Everyone expressed his grief at the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their gratitude for this.
But in such a situation sometimes there are good things and the mind gets satisfaction.
There was a good work in the Gadarol in the Parliament but the country was not taken into account.
Brothers and sisters, It is a matter of pride and pride to say that my government has agreed with a bill related to the campaign for Divyangjans.
I express my gratitude to all the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this. On behalf of the millions of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is also committed to Divyangjan.
I have tried to speed up this initiative individually.
I wished that the disabled should get their rights and their rightful respect.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, by winning four medals in Paralympics, revived our efforts and belief.
He enhanced the dignity of the country due to his victory and also surprised the people with his capability.
Our Divyang Brothers and sisters also have an invaluable heritage and strength like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after this bill is agreed for the benefit of the Divyangjans, they will get more employment opportunities.
The limit of reservation has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has agreed to a new legislation in line with the UN.
It covers 14 categories.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we will be proud of the sports grounds.
The Indian Cricket Association won a 4-0-progress against England.
Some young sportspersons were commendable.
If our young player Karan Nair has done Trishati, then he will be able to do it.
L.
Rahal played 199 runs.
Virat Kohli, Karnadhar of the Kasoti Sangh, also led the Union in a good way.
Indian Cricket Associations of Spinner Golandaz R.

My heartfelt congratulations to all of them.
Even in the field of Hockey, there has been a good news and good news after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey Union has won the World Cup.
After 15 years, the Junior Hockey Union has named the World Cup.
My heartfelt congratulations to the young players for this achievement.
This achievement is in the forecast of the Indian Hockey Union.
Last month, our women sportspersons also performed well.
The Hockey Federation of Indian women won the Asian Employment Games and recently, the Indian women's associations earned bronze medals in the 18-year-old Asian Fertilizer Games.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the sportspersons of Cricket and Hockey Union.
My dear countrymen, the coming year of 2017 is a year of new joy and zeal, all your commitments will be fulfilled and we will achieve new heights of development.
This new year should also give a chance to the poor to live a happy life.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much.
Like every year, I went to Indo-China Separ to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher areas of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP and the soldiers of the army.
Every time it goes, but the experience of this Diwali is different.
125 crore citizens of the country, who dedicated it to the soldiers of Diwali, dedicated it to the security forces, were reflected in the faces of every young man and their feelings were filled with inspiration.
Somebody made poems, somebody took pictures, some cartoons, some people made video.
And when I read these letters, I was surprised.
How imaginative are these letters filled with emotions
At the same time, there was an information on My Gove that can you make a coffee table book by gathering selected things in it
A young man from our armed forces wrote to me, Prime Minister, the Holi of our soldiers, Diwali, every festival is on the border.
It seems as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, how we have expressed our feelings about our armed forces on this Diwali will continue to be limited only for some time.
I urge you to take this habit as a society, as a nation, as a nation, as a result of any festival or festival, how to keep in mind the soldiers of our country.
When all the nation stands with the armed forces, the strength of our armed forces increases by 1.
A few days ago, the Sarpanchs of the State of Jammu and Kashmir had come to visit me.
He was a member of the Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Summit.
He had come from different parts of the Kashmir valley and about 40-50 people were there.
I got the opportunity to talk to him for a long time.
He had come up with the issue of development of his village.
They had some demands and when our interactions began, the issues of environment, law and order situation and the future of the children came out.
In Kashmir, schools are being set on fire and their discussions have been overwhelmed and I have seen that the sorrow that all our countrymen were suffering from this.
He said that the future of children is not just a school but also a shield.
I urged them to look into the future of these children.
A few days ago, the board was tested and about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir tested the board.
I would like to congratulate him for his excitement, but I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to his parents, relatives and teachers and Sarpanchs of all the village panchayats.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked for information from you for Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that everyone has sent information on the same subject.
Everyone used to tell us about the notes of 500 and 1000.
I was also supposed to have to face many new problems in our daily life.
The way we were facing for 70 years cannot be easier to get rid of the disease.
I can understand the difficulties faced by you.
And such a big country, so much money, less than five hundred and thousand rupees, and this decision.
The whole world is looking at it. Each economist analyses it intensively.
More than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks and friends and day-to-days have been associated with the spirit of dedication.
Though there are many types of tensions, all of them are working with a very quiet mind, as a sacrifice for the service of the country and as a great transformation.
Starting in the morning, when will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such incidents emerge from TV, newspapers and discussions every day.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those beneficiaries who have worked hard in this Mahayog.
The strength was recognised only when success was achieved after the conspiracy.
I remember Changal, when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees had taken the burden on their shoulders and the work they did not work for 70 years.
Today, he has accepted the challenge again and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective manhood of all will give a new strength to this nation.
But the bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have the bad habits.
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this unaccounted money, anonymous money, some of them will find some ways and bring them back to the system.
They are exploring unfair ways to save their money.
It is sad that he has chosen the way to use the poor.
They are trying to save the money by filling the money in their accounts or doing some work from them, by showing the temptation or temptation to the poor.
I would like to tell such people today, whether to improve or not, whether to improve our wishes or not to follow the laws or not, what should they see the laws
But don't play with the lives of the poor by taking care of them.
And the government does not want our countrymen to face difficulties.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Triali, Ji Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is surely commendable that we have closed the notes of five hundred and thousand rupees.
I would like to bring many such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the people that they welcomed this hard step for the development of the nation despite being unhealthy.
Because we say that good days will come, but nobody liked to take such a step.
People of black money and corruption have been able to get a good boost after seeing all these notes of five hundred thousand rupees.
The best day will never come for every Indian.
It is so happy that it feels so proud that the common man of my country has a unique capability.
People go there, eat and after 2-4-6 days when they go there again, they get the money.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is service, sacrifice and authenticity.
During the election, I had launched the 'Chay Pe Church' programme and this was done all over the world.
But I don't know that we are engaged in 'Chay Pe Church'.
In Gujarat, a girl in Surat had only given tea to those who came to her marriage.
Once I saw the news on TV, when I was late in the night, I was seeing that Dhekiyazuli in Assam is a small village.
What did he do when he got a note of Rs. 2000
The neighbouring four women came together and they went to the market and bought them together and gave money by using a note of Rs.
See how changes are also happening in the field of lives.
Some people have benefitted from this campaign.
I got information from small towns.
Out of about 40-50 cities, it was reported that due to the closure of these notes, people did not pay their money.
We are aware that the poor people don't pay the money by going two days ago.
Those big people who don't know, who don't think of them, they don't pay and they are very tired.
Each municipality gets 50 percent of the amount of tax collection.
However, due to the decision of the 8th date, all the people ran away to deposit their old notes.
Last year, about three-and-a-half thousand crore rupees were deposited in 47 civilian departments.
And you will be surprised to hear that in a week, 13 thousand crore rupees were deposited in them.
But today I congratulate the farmers of my country.
I was just taking stock of the crop production in this season.
The farmers have also discovered roads due to difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in enhancing the economy.
Just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village will also be able to do their business for 24 hours. I believe that no law will stop them.
In order to provide loans to them through the Mudra Yojana.
But due to this decision, it becomes natural for them to face problems.
I want to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank's page on your mobile phone and keep POS Mission for Credit Card.
Learn how business can be done without using a note.
You can see how big malls and technologies enhance our trade, a small businessman can also increase our trade due to this ordinary Youzer Friendly Technology.
There is no possibility that there will be a chance to increase.
I invite you that we can contribute immensely to the creation of cashless society.
Technical roads are safe, trusted and faster.
I am confident that I would like to inform the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
But Friends, You are my true soldier and friend.
We have a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and we have the opportunity to take the country to the economic height.
The more experience we have, the older generation is not of this world.
We don't know what would have happened to the previous generation.
You know how online banking and online ticket booking are there.
There is nothing special in it.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do is that which is your dream, the cashless society, it is true that 100 percent will not be successful but we have not started.
If we start a cashless society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet is e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
However, after the date of 8th, the poor have started using RuPay card and its use has increased by about 300.
The way in which printed cards are available for mobile phones and printed cards are available for spending money in bank accounts.
It is easier that the way we send a Whatsapp.
It is known that the uneducated person has to forward the right vote.
Not only this, technology is getting so easy that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Whether it is a smoke, a seller of vegetables, a seller of milk or a seller of current leaf or tea, everyone can use it.
I have stressed on making this system more easier.
All the banks are working on this.
And we must have read in the last two-four days in the present letter that we have been able to remove the burden on the use of such cards.
The technology required to spend online will be in our mobile phones.
Not only this, for half an hour or two hours a day, we should tell at least ten families what is the use of technology and how can we download the technologies
We have to undertake the campaign to free the country from corruption, to make the country free from black money, to provide people with difficulty and problems.
I believe that if the common man learns this system, he will get rid of work and if all the youngsters of India joy in this work then it will not take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern Hindusthan in the world.
And we can do this through mobile phones and we can go to ten houses every day.
I invite you, let us not just stop with support, let us make changes and make changes.
We will take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where youngsters have transformed the lives of the nation and the revolution took place from the youth.
Kenya has set up a mobile system called M-Pesa, which used technology and named M-Pesa.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work in a collective manner in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSSs.
The most popular artists of this century, Amita Bhaji, are taking forward the Swachhata Mission in mind.
And that is why they remember cleanliness on the birth anniversary of our fathers.
He writes a poem of HarivanshRai ji, one of them, one of them, the body of soil, the life of joy, my introduction, through HarivanshRaiharivanshRai.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, I have been associated with you forever with my thoughts, your feelings, utensils and my goats.
At 11 o'clock, Mann Ki Baat programme is broadcast, but we will soon hear the translation from regional languages.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other.
Festival is the second name of the lives of Indians and it is natural for anyone from far off places.
Since the Vedas, the tradition of festivals of India has changed in accordance with this period.
But in all these journeys, one thing is that this entire journey of festivals that are being celebrated in India, its prosperity, its prosperity and its impact on the people is being linked to the end of their own.
The main objective of this thing is to expand individual and personality, to expand our limited ideas from society to Brahman and to achieve all this through the festival.
Our ancestors have scientifically incorporated all these things in the field of healthcare, in which weather, in which weather, in which weather, in which season the farmers take food, in the day of cooking, in the festivals.
Today the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of care.
The tradition of the festival of India is merely going to enhance love for nature, from children to thieves.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival that creates a sense of responsibility for everyone.
We take a vacation on Sunday, but we used to take a vacation on all the occasions and full moons of the older generations.
This is not the darkness that comes due to lack of light but it is also the darkness of the darkness.
It is an effort to eradicate the blindness of the society, the blindness of the individuals, the blindness of the individuals, and the light of positiveness by lighting the light on Diwali.
The pots of soil are in the house of the poor, but they seem to be clean and bright during the days of the sacred Diwali.
From that point of view, Diwali is also a cleanliness mission.
But not only in the house but also in the entire area, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village is the need of the hour.
In that context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments from all over the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali, Parliament and administrators.
Perhaps you will be aware that the US Postage Service has issued postal stamps this year on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his pictures of lighting on Diwali on Twitter.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a grand programme to gather all communities on Diwali in London and he himself participated in it.
There is no such city in Britain that does not celebrate Diwali with great enthusiasm.
What is the photograph that the Prime Minister of Singapore has taken on Instagram and has shared with the whole world with pride
While 16 women MPs from Singapore are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian Parliament.
He said that the Prime Minister of New ealand had come here recently, and we have to return to New ealand to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
I would like to tell you that this festival of Deepawali is a festival of inspiration from darkness to light to the world community.
In the festival of Deepavali along with new clothes and food items of different taste are also played with great interest .
Young children and young people like to burst out.
Sometimes small children don't feel enthusiastic, sometimes they are inviting big troubles by making a big sound together with many cracks.
I don't think of what is the possibility of a fire or what is happening to our neighbors.
In the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, news of fire and deaths is a matter of care.
On the day of Diwali, many doctors are keen to celebrate Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali takes place in our country for a long time.
While celebrating the festival of Deepawali, we also prepare the Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern part of India and this festival is celebrated for four days.
This festival also gives a very meaningful message to the society.
Whatever the Sun god gives us, it is difficult to reflect what we get from the direct and indirect Sun god.
Chhath Puja is a festival of the worship of the Sun .
It is said that people in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhath Puja is a festival in which the worship of Mother Sun is also done.
A big social message is also given through that.
In my emotions, the soldiers of the security forces have always been grateful for their sacrifices, penance and hard work. And with the same spirit, I came to my mind that the Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the people of the country for the campaign of message to solvers.
Today, I would like to salute the people of India who have no feeling of love, pride and respect for the people of the country.
The manner in which this feeling has emerged, every citizen has become a symbol of a strong strength.
Through the messages of all of us, our security forces have got new patience and patience.
There is no insolvency for the youth of our country, nobody has given messages, nobody has been able to express their emotions, whether it is school, college, students, villages, poor, businessmen, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons.
The media has also considered this Deepotsav as an opportunity to express gratitude to the army.
Today, while we celebrate Diwali, some are standing in the desert, some are on the peaks of the Himalayas, some are protecting the industries, some are watching the security of the airport, all these jawans are performing innumerable obligations.
I can imagine how proud it will be for my country's youth.
Innumerable emotions have been demonstrated on the Hashtag of the message to solvers.
Ashwinikumar Chouhan has sent a poem and it seems to me to be reading this time.
I speak Shivani Mohan.
Our soldiers are encouraging the message to solvers on the occasion of Diwali.
My elders and mother-in-law were both in the armed forces.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are many officers in the Army Circle on the border of the country who are getting good messages and they are getting a big boost.
I am sure that along with the officers and soldiers of the army, their entire family and their sisters also sacrifice a lot.
Through your messages, the entire army is getting a very good message and I would like to congratulate you on Diwali.
Whether it is natural calamities, the problem arising out of law and order, whether it is taking two hands with the enemy or the brave actions to bring back the youth going through wrong ways, our youth continues to be inspired by the nations emotions on every step of life.
I also want to tell you what is inspired to achieve success.
Our security forces have a young ITBP, Vikas Thakur, a resident of Chhotayasha village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our youngsters of ITBP had gone to their villages on vacation.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students of the city, some distance from that village, had not had toilets at this place.
NCC umbrella, members of NSS and engineering students decided to build toilets in the village.
These youngsters used to take all the necessary things, bricks, cements and other things that are required to build toilets on their shoulders and picked them up the whole day and picked them up to the village.
The youngsters built toilets in that village by their own hard work and made a small village in the remote areas of the forest open and defecated.
That is why Kerala too will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has announced the open defecation free of more than 150 locations in all the municipalities and municipalities.
10 districts have been made Open Defecation Free.
On 1st November, Haryana will celebrate its Golden Festival and he has decided to make his state open defecation free in a few months.
So far 7 districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on in every state at a rapid pace.
I have mentioned only some states.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens of all these states for participating in this campaign and contributing to the elimination of the darkness in the form of cleanliness of the country.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be stopped after presenting such a second scheme.
But generally nobody pays attention to these things.
The old schemes continue, the new schemes continue, the plans for the coming are being waited and this continues.
The houses in which gas is used for cooking in our country, the houses in which electricity is available do not need kerosene.
He has taken a big decision to free kerosene in Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon be free of kerosene as he has taken this task.
It will only focus on intermediaries and teams.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of us.
It is time to pay attention to the ambitions that have been created in the minds of the poor people of the country.
We have to take one step in order to get out of the narrowness.
Whatever our old ideas, the distinction between the child and the daughter should be destroyed in society.
The facilities in schools are now free resource houses for children and girls.
This is the opportunity to give our daughters a feeling of discrimination free India.
It is not right that darkness should be spread in the village even after the twentieth century has emerged.
In order to ensure that these villages are free from darkness at the earliest, the campaign for providing electricity is being successfully implemented.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke-free life to five crore families.
People like small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, bathing shops were stuck in the worst grip of public interest.
Several people have been freed from these evil cycle of interest through the schemes of Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Account.
Direct money is deposited in banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from mediators and parties.
My dear countrymen, Yesterday is 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great men of this country who dedicated their lives to the integrity of India.
It will be a matter of surety that Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st.
Sardar Patel took his entire life to connect the country and he succeeded in his mission and brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durgadev said that the same day Indira Gandhiji was killed.
We all know what happened in the country after his assassination.
Sir, what can I do to prevent such an indecent incident
My dear countrymen, this is not just the sadness of a person.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job of uniting the country.
This injustice to Sardar ji on the birth anniversary of that great man who lived for unity is painful for all of us.
But we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is many languages or many castes, many dresses, many types of diets, but unity of diversity is the strength of India, India is the specialty of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to avoid the spirit of spreading footprints and save the country.
It is our responsibility to make the best India that Sardar Saheb has given us a India.
The fundamental mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb had started seeing the struggle of the farmers.
However, Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for conflict but also for constructive work.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb and on 31st October, I urge you to recall wherever you are.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a celebration of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guided not only to the entire humanity, but to the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev, the service, the reality and the good.
Peace, unity and goodwill were his original mantra.
Every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev was launched to free society from discrimination, superstitions and misdeeds.
When this kind of disorder had reached the extreme border, Guru Nanak Dev chose brothers and sisters as his colleagues.
Let us move forward with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, which inspires us to shine up the light of knowledge and to liberate distinction like Sudha Guru Nanak Devji.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of this Diwali dedicated to the youth of the country.
My best wishes to all of you for your dreams, your resolves and your lives in happiness and joy.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
We have lost eighteen brave men of our country in the recent terrorist attacks in Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our soldiers.
He will lay the foundation stone for every such harvest and will make efforts to ensure that 1. 25 billion people live comfortably.
But the soldiers don't speak.
Today, I would like to talk to the people of Kashmir specially.
The people of Kashmir are now familiar with the anti-national forces.
And as the truth sees them, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Each parents feel that schools and colleges should work at the earliest.
The farmers think that the goods and fruits produced in the fields are going to the markets across the country.
It seems that economic behavior has to be smooth.
And for the past few days, this behavior has also started to be smooth.
We have to achieve new heights of development for our future generations.
I am sure that we can find solutions to every problem together, guide and guide the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the people of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know a lot through social media.
There is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings and feelings of every kind of people in India and it gives strength to democracy.
Recently, a young man named Harsh Vardhan, who was academic in the 21st century, gave me a different idea.
Then I decided that I would practice more than three hours a day.
I would like to be a citizen of the country.
I am glad that when Harsh Vardhan ji is in the atmosphere, you can think that in such a small age you can think of it with a quiet mind.
But Harsh Vardhan, I also want to say that the integrity that is in the minds of the people of the country is very valuable.
It is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This entrepreneurship reflects the commitment to showcase something.
Everyone used to feel like doing something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this emotion of the country in a very excellent way .
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan had inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
There is another way to express patriotism in the voices of bombs and monkeys to every citizen, which was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Shriman T.
Kartik has written on the Narendra Modi Power that the sports shown by him is the victory of human consciousness.
Mr. Varun Vishwanathan has written on the Narendra Modi Power that our Thaliton has done a very good job and we should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only both of us, but every person in the country has been associated with our players in Paralympics with an emotional ethos.
Going ahead of sports, these paralysis and the achievements of our sportspersons have made a complete change in the vision of humanity and the vision of seeing the Disabilities.
And I cannot forget the words made by my winner Deepa Malik ji.
When he won the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this text.
This time 19 athletes participated in the paralysis competition with three women in our country .
In comparison to other sports, when the Persons with Disabilities play, the skills of sports are more important than that.
You will be surprised to hear that our players have won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhazariya, who won the Gold Medal, won the second Gold Medal in BHALAFEK.
And when he was born, he had to lose one hand because of the stroke of electricity.
Imagine that the person who wins the first gold in the thirteenth year of age and gets the second gold in the last eighteenth year, so how much has he done in his life
Mariyappan Thangvelu won gold medals in a high jump.
He will not live in a big city or even in a middle class house.
In the 21st year of age, despite the physical complications, he won the medal to the country on the strength of the resolution.
Thallit Deepa Malik had done the least in the hoisting of the flag.
Varun C.
Bhati won bronze medals in a higher flying manner.
Very few people will be aware that this time the people with disabilities have performed in the Paralympics competition.
Not only this, I was surprised that when I came to know that the players who came to the fourth place in the competition to run with disabilities were not able to get medals, but in less than a short span of time, he completed the race in the competition of all the players.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving towards creating a simple plan for the development of paralysis.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a lot of wonderful experience in Gujarat's Navsari.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibira for Persons with Disabilities and a number of world events were recorded at that time.
The world cannot see, Gauri Shardul and that came from the remote forests of Nang district, the entire Ramayana is poetry.
And when I heard the people gathered there, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book to the people and composed the success story of the lives of persons with disabilities.
This experiment was registered in the Guinness Book of World Record .
It is a matter of great pride for all our countrymen to have three-three worlds in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on the same day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit, every citizen should become a duty and a triangular atmosphere should be created about cleanliness.
Now when two years will be completed on October 2, I can assure you that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 1.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can say that everybody has tried to move one step ahead.
And that is why everybody, whether it is a common citizen or a government office or a road, a bus station or a railway station, a school or a college, a religious place or a hospital, a child or a senior citizen, a rural poor, a farmer, everybody is contributing to cleanliness.
Media friends have also played a positive role.
I want you to move ahead.
And that is why if you want to tell about rural India then about two crore and a half million toilets have been constructed so far.
In the states, in the districts, in the villages and villages, a competition has been started.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in the Open Defecation Free Village Mission.
Congratulations to those who have worked and those who are trying to do this.
And I urge the countrymen that for the honour of mothers and sisters, we have to free the country from this problem.
Let us take this pledge forward.
Especially my young friends, I want to present a scheme for those who use Halli technologies.
On this 1969, we will not only be able to know the situation of building toilets in our city but also ask for construction of toilets.
We must take advantage of this, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate sector to come forward.
He should give sponsorship to young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
He can be sent to the district as a representative of the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizers manufacturer companies have been asked to buy the fertilizer that will be produced from the waste.
The farmers who make organic farming have been asked to provide the fertilizer.
Those who have to improve the health of our land, those who are careful about the health of the earth and those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers have been asked to provide these fertilizers as per the requirements.
And Mr. Amitabha Bachan ji is contributing specially to this work as a good messenger.
I invite the youth to start a new start-up in the field of west to health, waste to wealth, to develop machines and technology.
This is certainly a task to do.
An Indian Sanitation Conference is being organised this year from 25th September to 3rd October.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of the cities and commissioners from all over the country will meet together and discuss intensive discussions on cleanliness and sanitation.
What can be the technology
What can be the economic policy
How to get public participation
How can it create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new news about cleanliness is constantly coming.
Recently, I have read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technology University have gone to seven hundred villages and launched a awareness campaign on the construction of toilets.
He worked hard and contributed to building nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, we must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, a group of Ganga swimn 2800 kms from Devprayag to Gangasagar, and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidelines.
Every department pays attention to cleanliness by deciding it for 15 days.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Department of Rural Development will come together in October to create a Swachhata in their respective fields.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will conduct Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective sectors from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to join the department where we have a close relationship with them.
You must have seen that a survey on cleanliness is being done.
In the past, 73 cities were surveyed and what is the situation of cleanliness in the country.
Now this work will be done in about 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of you will contribute to this.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
I urge you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
At this time, I have to say that there should be only one thing of Khadi in our family so that Diwali can be used in the house of the poor.
On October 2, as a citizen, can we join the Swachhta Mission
Two hours, four hours, you will take part in the cleanliness work and I will tell you to take a photo of it and take a photo and take it to Narendra Modi's power to share it.
Show video if you have a video.
See, our efforts will give a new strength to this mission across the country.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving life is different and nobody can register it or take it.
And the responsibilities that he received can be called an inspirational event in the national life of India.
Our country's youth, small and big institutions, people in the corporate sector, students and NGOs will commemorate Joy of Giving Wicks in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
Its aim is to bring food and clothes together to the needy people.
I am glad to see that game on the faces of those poor children.
I would like to assist those youngsters in the cities where this Joy of Giving is going to be celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today, 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and his birth centenary year is going to begin.
He worked to explain the political ideas that millions of workers like me have been working with the political ideas.
He reiterated Indias root-related kingdom and gave a philosophy of supporting India's cultural tradition.
Today, the birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya is being inaugurated.
It is their contribution to the principles of 'Sabka Sahitya Sabka Vikas'.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the interests of every person in the bottom.
How will the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented all the economic frameworks in both words of work and water to every farmer.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Vijayadashmi, two years ago, I started talking about Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the workers for their blessings and blessings on the occasion of the completion of two years.
I am also grateful to Akashwani because he not only spread the message of Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to reach the labourers from all regional languages.
I also express my gratitude to all those workers who had written letters and put the doors of the government and showed the flaws in the work of the government. Akashwani gave a platform to the government officials and to solve the problems of the people.
That is why Mann Ki Baat was not just a fifteen-twenty-twenty-two-minute interaction, it became an opportunity to change society.
What can be a greater pleasure for anyone.
How will it be a festival connecting man and man
And that strength will be the source of true strength and then we will come together to celebrate the festival of victory.
Let us take a mantra of unity to serve this strength.
To take the nation to a new height, celebrate Navaratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity, goodwill, and celebrate Vijaya Dashmi.
English rendering of PMs address through Mann Ki Baat from Akashwani
My dear countrymen, this park is the birth anniversary of Hockey magician Dhyanchand on 29th August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remember his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in winning Gold in Hockey in the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
You all know the name of Breadman.
My countrymen, as soon as the time of Mann Ki Baat starts coming closer, the information on MyGover or Narendra Modi Power starts coming.
Besides crickets, there is a lot of awareness in Indians about other sports.
He was a source of inspiration to give me this message.
Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar must speak in the Mann Ki Baat of this time.
The medals we received were received by the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anybody.
One of these girls is from north India, one from South India, one from eastern India and another from India.
That is why it seems as if these girls from all over the country have taken a bright look at the name of India.
The MyGover Summit Thakur writes that we have been able to do better than this in Olympics.
He said, Honourable Modi sir first congratulated him on winning two medals in Rio.
But I would like to pay my attention to this thing. Is it really good for your achievements
And the answer is, no
We need to take a long step in the field of sports.
Our parents are still dependent on the practice.
The society assumes that sports is a waste of time.
We cannot ignore that we cannot work according to our expectations.
Something has happened that those players who were performing well in India, those who were performing in the sportspersons here could not be shown there and only two medals were received in the medals.
One more thing is that if you don't get medals then you will know that for the first time Indian players have shown some good performance in many sports.
Behold, in Nambaji, his innovation, Bindraji, was ranked fourth, and he won medals in a very short difference.
The same thing happened in Tennis, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
After Ush, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar became eligible for the last round of track field...
You will be happy to see that after 36 years, women reached Hockey Team Olympics.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the Hockey team of men succeeded in reaching the Nock Out ferry.
Our union is strong and a part of the dignity is that those who won the Gold Medal, who were the only ones to face in the entire competition, who would defeat them
Some sportspersons were good, such as Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Anu Das...
My countrymen, we have to do a lot of things but if we continue to do anything then our way will be disappointed.
I have announced a committee.
The committee of the Government of India will conduct a broad study and a study of what is being done about sports worldwide.
The Committee will create a framework for what we can do.
We have to make a visionary plan for 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports, what can the states like one or two sports and how power we can show in that game.
We will be fully prepared and I am confident that we will be able to achieve the best position in sports and sports.
We have to move ahead with this resolution.
Ladies and gentlemen, 5th September Teachers Day
For a few years, on the occasion of Teachers Day, I have been giving time to the students and I have been spending my time as a student among them.
I was also learning a lot from these students.
This is the Teacher's Day on 5th September for me and also the Education Day.
That is why there is a thought in the mind that I should express my feelings about this.
The place of mother in life is also the place of teachers.
I have seen such teachers who have more concern than themselves.
He lives for his disciples and students.
At present, after Rio Olympics, Pulela Gopichand has discussed all over the country.
He is not only a sportsperson but also an example of how he is an excellent teacher.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On 5th September, the birth anniversary of former President of India, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, and the entire country is celebrated as a Teacher Day.
Even though he reached any place in his life, he himself tried to live in the geography of a teacher.
I have written such a beautiful signature and my own signature is very bad.
It showed somebody's good signature that respect increases in my mind.
If you have photographs with your teachers, you will remember better, you will be inspiring, you must share yourself.
Keep in mind that seeing the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students will be valuable for us.
Brothers and sisters, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a hypocrisy and all of us feel that our country, our society, our family, every person, their lives are incomplete.
When we think of the Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival is to be given to Lokmanya Tilaks.
We must discuss the topics that touch social life and create programmes that inspire the society, inspire the society, as well as the self-esteem that he has given is my birth right and that I should achieve.
Even today, not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, Ganesh Festival began to be celebrated.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions and queue competitions are organized.
It also touches social topics with a artistic manner.
This inspirational mantra has been given by Lokmanya Tilak to us that Swarajya is my birth right as the campaign of public education continues through the Ganesh Festival.
Now we have the right to move towards Suraj, do we not let the message of this mantra be given to the public Ganesh Festival
I am inviting you.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival brings innovation in individuals and society.
Life without festival is impossible, but it is expected to change as per the demand of time.
I have come to know that some people, especially the Ganesh Festival, the Durga Puja, have written a lot and they are worried about the environment.
The statues made of POP are not environment friendly .
This pain has been told by others as he has done with a rapidity.
I pray to all of you to use the statues of Lord Ganesha and Mother Durga like ancient times and not follow our old traditions.
Conservation of conservation, conservation of our river ponds, conservation of slaughtered animals from pollution is a way of service to God.
I don't know how to take these issues from me, but I don't say it alone, but it is the opinion of many.
According to some people, the idolater of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfale, the institution of Kollapur-Nisarg friend, Vigyan Prabodhini.
Environment-friendly Ganesha Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja has a lot of time .
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be decorated by the Saints on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated her entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India for a lifetime, gets the saturated degree.
The event will be held on 4th September by 1. 25 billion Indians, under the leadership of the Government of India and the Ministry of External Affairs, Smt.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a big change.
Manpower is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has successfully tried to bring people together for the sanitation of the Ganges and the Ganga with the help of five state governments.
On the 20th of this month, village heads on the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all these chiefs who came to Allahabad for this resolution - somebody from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, West Bengal.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the Swachhta Mission of Ganga by bringing together the manpower.
Someone wrote from English and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their homes.
He asked for construction of toilets.
Some children have written that this year I will not be celebrated this year, but make a toilet.
These children of seven to seventy years have done this work.
It was so impressive that the next day when we went to school, parents wrote a letter to the teachers and they were convinced that we would make toilets at home by a date.
Congratulations to all those students who have tried to make the toilets with their hearts and their parents.
One of the sixteen-year-old daughters of this district, Mallama, called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the specialty of the village chief Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and made toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
It is a resolution of some Indians.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody has been connected in that form, everybody has been contributing some or the other.
Everyday news comes: What are you doing
The Government of India asked people to make a film on cleanliness of two-three minutes and send this small film to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that we will also fill such competitions.
The vision of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness campaign.
We have been inviting me, our countrymen, India has always been keen to have harmony with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not a channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbor is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected to the same cultural tradition today.
He will interact and exchange visions, and the Bengali-speaking people of both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
Akashwani has a big contribution in people-to-people contact.
The President inaugurated this channel.
Thanks to Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I also wish all the friends of Akashwani that they are contributing to the foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, maybe you have given me the smoke of the post of Prime Minister, but in the end I am a man like you.
Sometimes the emotional events touch me more.
Some such emotional events give a new strength, inspire and inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
A 84-year-old mother-in-law is a retired teacher, he wrote to me.
I am feeling that I have told you not to declare my name.
In the letter, he said that we have requested to leave the gas subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago, some of us came to a person and gave me a letter and thanked me for giving it up.
This letter of Prime Minister of India is not less than Padmashree for me.
Our countrymen, who left the gas subsidy, tried to give them a letter and somebody would give my representative that letter.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, your campaign to get rid of the smoke of the poor mothers and I am a retired teacher, I will be young in a few years.
I have been sending a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that the poor mothers get rid of the smoke of the smoke.
We are aware that a mother who communicates from the pension of a common teacher, when 50 thousand rupees are given for the gas connection of poor mothers, the question is not about fifty thousand rupees.
These are the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which will strengthen the trust of my country's future.
He didn't write this letter as a Prime Minister, but wrote a letter to me, Modi Bhaiyya.
There was frequent flood situation in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local self-help institutions and the social institutions have helped the citizens.
In August 2016, all the parties of the opposition parties, who did not give any opportunity against each other, jointly approved the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all the parties start walking together then this is an example of how big it was.
In such a situation, all the political parties of the country together raised a tone in relation to what happened in Kashmir.
Those who are trying to create an inconvenience by furthering these small kids, they will have to answer it sometime or the other.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and has been devoted to diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to empower the people who sacrifice unity and then the future of the country will be bright.
I have full faith in the power of 1. 25 billion people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports, every young man in the country will be in the color of enthusiasm and hope.
You all know that in a few days, the greatest sports sports emerges in the world.
Rio is going to be repeated in our ears.
There will be a lot of hope, but the work of encouraging the self-confidence of those sportspersons who are going to play in Rio is of 125 crore people in the country.
We must do something to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we are in the coming days.
The sportspersons who reach Olympics reach there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard investigation.
Winning and losing are important, but it is more important to reach that sports, and that is why we wish all the sportspersons who have gone to Rio Olympics.
Today, I am speaking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
There are many of you poets, who have written poems, maybe even if they write poems, some people will do it in every language, but the poem that Surj has sent me is sharing with you.
Ankit this young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam Ji.
The whole country and the world paid tributes to him, but when the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, the words of Science, Technology and Missile come and the future capability comes in front of India and that is why Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
Ankita ji is right to say.
And if we have to go with him or go ahead then we must do research and innovation and both of these are the souls of technology.
If research and innovation are not innovative then the storage water is smelling and technology also becomes a burden.
If we live on the basis of innovation and innovation, the government has taken some steps to create a sweetness of science in the new generation, innovation and innovation, and that is why I say that we should take care of innovation.
And if I call Let us to innovation then I mean AIM.
10 lakhs will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be constructed and 10 lakhs will be provided for their care for five years.
On the other hand, India is swinging with many problems.
In everyday life, we have problems and problems.
Now we have to find solutions based on technology.
On behalf of Atal Grand Challenges, we have urged the younger generation of the country to explore, research and innovate and take it to us if we see problems and problems.
I am glad to see that the Government of India has given a special prize to the technologies that have been resolving problems and problems, and I am glad that people are interested in this thing when we said about the technological labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we were also worried about the evil. These days the rains are enjoying and the news of the floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are working very well to help the victims.
Everyone's mind is happy, despite some difficulties due to rains, because the center of our entire economic upheaval is rain and the farming is going on.
Sometimes there are such diseases that we have to follow the whole birth .
But if we are aware, beware, if we are working then the way to escape from it is easier.
V . . sees publicity but sometimes we are slightly sad in the context of action .
I urge you people not to enter dengue in our houses, in our departments, in our houses, in our family, to avoid any disease from water.
My dear countrymen, I want to take our attention towards another crisis.
Today, life has become very fast and we do not have time to think about ourselves and ourselves due to continuous running.
If the patient falls sick then it feels as soon as possible and for that antibiotics are taken .
We don't run through shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even after leaving the incomplete it will benefit those bacteria , even if they take more than required then the bacteria will benefit therefore the course of taking pills has become as many days .
It is important to fulfil the health, but it is important to fulfil the course.
In the doctoral language it is called ntibiotic resistance , how to use ntibiotics , follow its rules .
The mortality rate has decreased in the last decade, but even today the lives of pregnant mothers can not be saved in large quantities.
The deficiency of blood during pregnancy , infections occurring during delivery , high blood pressure , unknowingly some problems destroy their lives .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign named Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign on the 9th of every month the pregnant woman will be tested free of cost at the government health center .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I urged women sick physicians that you cannot provide free services to poor mothers on 9th.
Can not my doctor brothers and sisters give twelve days a year for the poor
There are thousands of doctors, they have written the same letters as they have taken forward by accepting my request.
There are thousands of doctors who have believed in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and in the world.
The Shukracharya Niti says that there is no herb in which there is no medicinal properties.
Those who donate trees take care of them in the heavens like their sons.
But in today's generation, there are some people who follow these ideals and come into practice.
In the Mahabharata, it has been said that the trees also fulfil the responsibility of the child in the world, as if Sonal is not only of our parents but also to fulfill the wishes of the entire society.
In Junnar Taluka of Pune in Maharashtra , a farmer of Narayanpur village Khandu Marti Mahatra had inspired the marriage of his daughter Sonal in a different way .
The temples should start the tradition of planting in the rainy season.
Planting can easily become a mass movement.
I always tell the farmers that if we damage the land due to dams on the edges of our farm, can we make timber farming instead of dams
Today, for building houses in India, crores of rupees have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant a tree that will be useful for wooden commodities and household work, after fifteen-twenty years we can cut it and sell it with the permission of the government, you can get a new source of income and you can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, a lot of campaigns have been implemented in several states using the climate of weather, the Government of India has recently agreed a CAMPA law and more than Rs. 40 thousand crore will go to the states for plantation.
I am told that on July 1, the Maharashtra government has planted two and a half crore trees in the entire state and has decided to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a big mass movement.
Rajasthan, Maru-Bhumi have celebrated a big forest festival and has promised to plant 25 lakh trees.
25 lakh trees in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who are aware of the land of Rajasthan can know how big they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase the green sector by 50 by 2029.
Railways have also started this work in the Green India Mission which has been launched by the Central Government.
In Gujarat, there is a bright tradition of Sudha Van Mahotsav.
This year, several projects such as Amravan, Ekta Van, Shahid Van have been undertaken in Gujarat and crores of trees have been planted.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone is eligible for commendation.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to go to South Africa a few days ago.
Whenever there is a foreign tour, there are discussions on international policy trade, there are discussions on security and some MoUs are to be signed.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage .
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and ability fall on the ears of the world then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela appear to us.
During my visit to South Africa, he visited the Finics Settlement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhis residence as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunities are not such a big mantra for any society and the government.
The two paths of harmony and harmony lead us to a bright future.
We all hope for a good life, the children want a good future, the needs of everyone are different, the initiatives are different, but the roads are the same and it is the same for development, equality, equality, equality and equality.
Let us take pride in these Indians, who have shown this original mantra of life in South Africa.
He gave me a deliberation, Prime Minister, I am speaking a craftsman from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I had read a letter in the newspaper that a woman was stuck and lost Rs. 21 lakhs and committed suicide due to false e-mails.
I am very sad to be a woman.
I want to know your ideas about this.
Everyone knows that if we know about our mobile phones and e-mails then there is a message that you have got so much money and you have to take so much money.
Some people are embarrassed and some are hungry.
These technologies are spreading in the world.
Sometimes we are also in love.
I feel that we should be cautious of this joy, beware, if such a joy comes out then we should tell our friends and friends, they should be a little aware.
My dear countrymen, during the Parliament session, I got the opportunity to meet many people.
Our MPs bring people from their departments, meet them, tell them about their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The enthusiasm of kids and girls was to see that they had brought a big album along with themselves.
The artistic pictures have been carved and painted at the station.
You must go to Aligarh and see this station.
This is an example of changes in the participation of the people.
Thanks to all those who have worked like this in the country and I congratulate my colleagues in Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there is a season of festivals in our country.
Festivals will be held in temples and pilgrimages.
You are also connected to these festivals at home and outside.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our stature.
Like the last year, cannot we give the birth anniversary of Raksha Bandhan to the mothers and sisters of our country as Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Life Jyoti Bima Yojana
Imagine that such a visit should be made to the sister so that her life can be safeguarded.
Moreover, if there is a woman who makes a meal in her house, if she is a woman who cleanses her house, whether she is a daughter of the poor mother or she can visit the festival of Raksha Bima Yojana or life Jyoti Bima Yojana
My dear countrymen, many of you are those who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of Indias independence can inspire us, create new zeal and hope, this can be an opportunity for the country's resolve to do something.
The festival of independence is not a government programme, it should be the people of the country.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we will do some good work that connects with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, this is a tradition that I get the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on August 15.
You will have something in your mind and you will have to bear that thing from the Red Fort.
If you want to tell me from the Red Fort as a representative of yours, you must send me some suggestions and suggestions and suggestions.
Let us recall the heroes who sacrificed their lives for freedom, let us remember the great men who live for India and let us move forward with a resolve to do something for the country.
Once again I have got the opportunity to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat is not an act for me.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach every corner of the country through Mann Ki Baat.
I express my gratitude to Akashwani for the successful efforts made by Akashwani to broadcast the translation of Mann Ki Baat into regional languages at eight o'clock in the night.
And I am happy that the people who listen to the news of my mind, after the programme, they reach me through the telephone and by the telephone and by the telephone and by the Narendra Modi page.
I am very useful in running the government.
How active should the government be for public welfare
How much priority should be given to the welfare of the people
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
The World Environment Day is on 5th June.
The environmental issues are discussed all over the world.
The main theme of Environment Day is the ero Tolerance for Elligible Wildlife Trade, but we must talk about trees and water.
The reason for this is that you must have seen that the forests of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir had suffered a lot recently.
Therefore, saving the forests and saving water becomes the responsibility of all of us.
He interacted with the Chief Ministers of each state for about two and a half hours.
I heard what to tell them.
Some states, especially in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have made a lot of use of technology.
We have to reach out to other states of the country through NITI Aayog through these successful measures taken by the State Governments.
Peoples participation is the main cause of success in solving such problems.
And therefore, water conservation is equally important.
And that's why drop-more crops - each drop - high production, micro-irrigation- micro-irrigation, low water-made PK.
It is a matter of great pleasure that in many states the farmers of sugarcane producers are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation.
I also learnt from them that there are big goals in front of many states, especially in Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, which have done a lot of work in terms of smooth irrigation.
Their efforts are to bring two-two-three lakh hectares of land under micro irrigation every year.
If this mission is implemented in all the states then it will not only benefit the farmers but also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to use the water of rivers like Godavari and Krishna in a better way.
Efforts are being made to re-establish groundwater with the help of technologies through Nirvana Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
People are also providing financial assistance to the people of Maharashtra who are in the process of movement.
I am sure this movement of Jal-Main Shivar Abhiyan will be useful in protecting Maharashtra from future water conservation.
The State of Chhattisgarh has taken the initiative of the Democratic-Jalsarajya.
A big campaign has been taken to revive the visitors from Rajasthan and Gujarat, where the ancient streams are located.
However, in some parts of that state there is water storage.
There is a big work being done by laying checkhams and small dams.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is a lot of water therefore we stay careless and after the end of the rains there is no water therefore how will it go on .
And water is not just limited to the farmers.
This is related to villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural, Shrimant-Garib.
Therefore, when the rainy season is coming, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali here, how much water we saved in the rainy season
You will see, our joy will increase many times.
And this is not only of the government but of the political leader but also of the common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to create a modern India.
Our India is going to be transparent.
We have to reach the same way from one end to the other.
We have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I want to touch a topic about which you help me, we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards cashless society.
Through electronic technology, we can get money and send money.
There is no fear of going to your pocket Chori. There is no concern about keeping the target.
It will be registered on its own.
Initially it will be a little difficult to use this method but once the habit has become easier then this system will become easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar number has also been received and mobile phones have now come in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jam (JM).
We can move towards cashless system and cashless society by putting them together .
You must have seen that a rupee card has been given with Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And Halli is also a small instrument which has been made available to P.
O.
It is said that through this machine, you can give money to others by using Aadhaar number and RuPay card.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to provide money through POS
The second initiative has been taken by the bank on mobile.
Exchange of money through your mobile phone will be very easy.
This is a step taken by the bank in a way.
There are also movements in the post office to provide bank services.
If we have learnt to use these methods, if we have a habit then there will be no need for direct payments, there will be no need to take money.
Behaviour will continue to be transparent and transparent.
The behaviour of non-violent behaviour will shut down.
The result of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I must tell the people of the country that we should start it.
Let us see that once this system has started, we will move forward easily.
Would anybody think about it twenty years ago that so much mobile was in our hands
Gradually it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that the cashless system will be gradually sizeable.
But it will be better if it comes to light in a short time.
We must encourage our sportspersons participating in Rio Olympics to increase their confidence.
He was the Chief Minister.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India.
Whether they get nutritious food according to the need or not .
Whether they should be the trainer for their physical fitness or not .
I am glad to see that there is a possibility of ensuring a new responsibility as the Chief Minister, as a co-operative sports minister in such an environment.
When our sportspersons feel that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with us, it becomes a great strength and reinforces their confidence.
Last time I had taken up the topic of the FIFA under Seventeen World Cup.
I have received information from all over the country and during this period I can see that the atmosphere of football has started to grow throughout the country.
Several initiatives are being taken to create a team.
I have received a lot of information about the Narendra Modi Power.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing but the interest in sports in the minds of thousands of youth of the country was a pleasant experience for me.
We have a right relationship between Cricket and India, but I have seen how much faith in football
Everything should not be calculated in victory and defeat.
With sportspersons, India should make its identity in the world.
I urge the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiastic consciousness for our sportspersons.
For the last eight-three days, there have been new solutions from anywhere.
I am not talking about the select decisions, I talk about those students who have studied and tested for the year.
It is now clear that the tenth anniversary has begun to come together and our daughters are singing parameters.
It is a matter of joy.
We have to move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a new kind of questions and I have never thought of it.
I was very happy to read this.
He said, when I went home with a target of 89. 33 percent, I thought that I would be praised all around, it would be a rain of appreciation.
But it seems to me that there is a tension in my mind.
I have read your letters, I feel that this pain can be not only of yourself but of millions and millions of students like you.
Because the atmosphere has become such that we can find errors more than accepting joy.
This is the second form of negative tendency.
I would like to tell the neighbouring people and parents to enjoy the salvation that your children will bring.
Otherwise, one day will come that you will get 100 percent of the qualities and somebody will say that you have got 100 percent of the qualities but if you have done a smooth job then it would have been better.
Therefore, it is important for each thing to have a limit.
Gir Goswami, a satisfaction of Jodhpur, has written a letter in the same sense.
He says that the people close to him are not ready to take care of their fate.
They have said that something else has been doing better and something has been doing better.
I would like to tell you that in such a situation you will not allow yourself to keep your balance.
Everybody expresses hope and listen.
Keep firm on our commitments and try to do something better.
But if you don't find solutions to what has been achieved then you will never be able to build a new thing.
And that is why I urge you to sing the songs of the success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good quality in the examination, they move ahead in the field of sports, move ahead in the field of music, move ahead in the field of art and business.
God has given everybody some skills.
Buses, you will recognize your inner capabilities, focus on it, you will progress in life.
There was a time when the moderate words were an integral part of the folk songs of the Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivkumar, who handled this plaintiff and today he became an important player in the field of global music.
In the Indian Music Area, there was a limited scope for the singing of Sunai.
During the reign of kings and kings there was a place of sunset near the entrance of Darbar .
However, Ustad Bisilla Khan took over the sentence and kept the sun at a height of one of the best words in the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I remember that the cost of medicines in our country's poor households is going to lead to the economic growth of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very low, but after getting sick, health becomes like the first one but it costs a lot.
Why shouldn't we keep our lifestyle so that we don't get sick and we don't have any economic burden on our families.
One is, cleanliness is the most important way to stay away from the disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And the second thing is Yoga for which I have been constantly urging.
Sometimes it is also called Yoga.
21st June is the International Yoga Day.
The whole world has an attraction for Yoga, faith and the world has adopted it.
This is an invaluable visit by our ancestors to the world.
The stressed world gets the strength of living a balanced life by yoga.
It is easier for those associated with Yoga to be healthy, to be balanced, to create a strong will, to concentrate in every work.
June 21- Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective environment can change the life of the person.
I hope that on June 21, we will definitely do something about this.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use this 21st June for yoga in our lives
Can you do yoga science in our social life
I urge you not to remain behind.
It is very important to be healthy to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, through Mann Ki Baat, I have always been associated with you.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile number and we could hear the word Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on it.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever you want to hear the word Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on this number, we can hear in that language.
Namaste.
We decide to do many things during the holidays.
During these vacations, there is a season as a humidity, it feels like enjoying the fountains, if you do a little bit of admiration in the afternoon then it will be possible.
But this time, heat has enjoyed this joy all around.
It is natural to have a conscious environment across the country.
And whenever there is frequent illness in it, the water storage stops.
Sometimes, due to invasion, sometimes due to obstruction, water flows due to obstruction, water storage becomes lesser than capacity.
And the water storage capacity has decreased due to this happening for years.
Yet I have seen that the citizens also make a lot of efforts for this.
In many villages, there is awareness about this and the real value of water is only those who have faced the crisis of rapidity.
And there is sensitivity in saving water at such places and there is an activity to do something about it.
A few days ago, I was told that the Hivere Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district and the villagers of Maharashtra have taken the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided not to leverage such crops, which have more water, litter or bananas.
It feels very easy to hear this but it is not that easy.
Have all made such a big resolution together
He took the initiative on Tushar irrigation, drainage irrigation, water conservation and water conservation, and today the village is standing on its own to overcome the shortage of water.
At the same time, I am telling you about this small village of Hiverebazar, but I congratulate all such villages and their best work.
He built about seventy-seven farmers.
As a result, the level of groundwater has increased, the level of water has increased.
He said that when the cooks need water, they got water and they had huge data.
The income from farming has increased by twenty percent.
Besides saving water, the level of water increases and improves the quality of water.
However, many such initiatives are implemented by the citizens who never come out.
If the government has implemented a good mission then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around you then you will be able to see how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through new initiatives.
It is a human habit that whenever there is any kind of crisis, the feeling of all the troubles are removed.
There will be 106 to 110 rains in the rainy season and it will be possible for everyone to get a peaceful message.
It's time to rain but it's going to be a good rain.
Can we take any initiative to save water in the village from now on
The farmers need soil and it is useful for the crops in the field.
If we drive the villages into the fields then it will be beneficial for the farming and the capacity to accumulate water in the lakes will increase.
There will be water in our sisters.
Today, we have a water crisis, there is a situation of evil, but the next month and a half months are in our hands.
Their concerns are social because this work has been going on for nearly thirty years.
A lot of money has been spent for several governments and several schemes.
The Ganga gives us blessings, the Ganga gives us employment and we get a new strength to live by the Ganges.
As the Ganges flows, it gives a new momentum to the economic movements of the country.
A Bhagirathi brought us to the Ganges but to save it, millions of Bhagirathis need to be saved today.
This campaign will never be successful without the participation of people.
There are several efforts in this regard at the government level.
Efforts are being made to get support from the states of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to participate in the social and NGOs.
Several steps have been taken to keep the river Ganga clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the waters of the Ganges.
The dense waste flows every day from the rivers and rivers in the rivers.
In order to clean the waste, the work of cleaning the waste on water in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of Trash Skiller.
It has been made available to all local administration institutions and they should clean the waste using it.
And recently, I was told that where these efforts are being done in a better way, three tons of waste is removed every day.
That is, it is true that such a large quantity of dirt is prevented from growing.
In the coming days, a plan has been made to set up a trash skimmer at some other places and the people living on the banks of the Ganges and the Yamuna will soon experience it.
In order to overcome industrial pollution, an action framework has been prepared with paper industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar factories.
I still feel that there will be good results.
The forgotten substances falling from paper factories are now on the way to close .
This is the symptom that we are taking steps in the right direction and awareness has also increased in a way.
And I have seen that not only will I live on the banks of the Ganges, but if a person from far-off southern region meets me then he definitely says that the Ganga will not be clean.
This belief of the common man will achieve the success of the Ganga Swachhta Mission.
Citizens are donating donations in the cleaning of Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Day in India.
On this very day, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And gradually, the Panchayat Raj system spread across the country is working successfully as an important part of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, Dr. Ambedkar ji's birth anniversary, I got the opportunity to visit Mahu, who was his birthplace.
I am going to celebrate the Panchayat Raj Diwas in the state where our tribal brothers and sisters live in the state of Jharkhand on 24th.
And at three o'clock in the afternoon, he interacted with all the Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a big job to create awareness.
How will the democratic institutions be empowered at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
In some villages, foodgrains were taken up.
The awareness that has emerged from the villages is the sustainability of India-Uday.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-Uday.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday, we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure from Mumbai and expressed her grief.
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmala Gharpure.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
The absence of proper schools or colleges or lack of quality of education .
Even after completing education, they don't know many things, so they keep their children back in the world.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the tallest dream of mothers and children's education.
And I believe that the results of those families in which this awareness is felt are seen on the school.
Each government in our country has emphasized the issue of education and every government has made its efforts in its own way.
But the importance of expanding now is more than the reforms in our education system.
We have done a very big job of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
We must now be the priority of quality education from the literacy campaign.
Now the infrastructure has to be counted on the consequences.
How many children have come to school have been seen today.
We have to focus on providing better education and proper education to those children who have come to school.
You must have seen in the budget of this government and an effort has been made to give better education.
In this budget, we will see ten government universities and ten private universities being freed from government controls and coming to challenges and competition levels.
Should we want to work for best universities, best universities
This scheme has been brought to them to give full freedom.
At the same time, the importance of education is as important.
People have been asking me about one issue for the past few days.
He writes on the Web Portal MyGov, some people write on my Narendra Modi Power and many youngsters are writing in it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnwal.
Today, education and sports are also very important for the youth.
They should have a feeling of consciousness, a good leadership, which will also lead them to all-round development.
I would like to encourage more and more youth and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind to speak to all these teams before talking to you.
And when I asked him that this was the first such meeting that had happened before, he answered that this is the first such meeting since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those young friends who have urged me in the context of all these works.
There is a lot of work at your level, but in a collective manner, if our organizations work in an organised form, then how much results can be achieved.
And I am sure that I am the captain of the NCC National Corps.
I have benefitted from it in my childhood and I believe that such organizations should have a new consciousness.
I had put some issues before them in this meeting.
He was talking to him on a number of issues.
We have a number of young organisations, how can we bring innovation in their activities and programmes
If we write this on my Narendra Modi Power then I will reach the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a momentum.
I believe that it will be possible for you to join yourself with all of them.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you that you all will be able to think about it.
I believe that this is a matter of awakening all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is that how many parties will give gas cylinders during the last several elections.
And if every political party wants to reach the middle class, then the gas cylinder is a very important subject.
This is a public experience.
However, it was never considered by going out of this checkpoint.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to seek my best wishes before you.
I chose a different path and that was the way to trust the people.
Sometimes we have to trust our people more than our political leaders.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, grants have been denied as a right-wing equation.
I would especially tell all the political classes that we should do at least one thing to believe in people everywhere.
We will get the results that we have never thought.
We have to go in this direction.
And I always feel like I have come to my mind to have a childhood for the third and fourth class jobs
Believe in those who have received tests and qualities.
Sometimes I feel that we should declare that there is no ticket penetration on this line of railways.
This is not a government rule but it can create an atmosphere of faith.
And this environment is not a political leader, it has been created by one crore families of the country.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and newspaper is painful.
Is there any good happening around us in this country with a population of 1. 25 billion
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deep condolences, but I feel that this anger is not on me but on the situation of misery.
You must remember, our former President, Dr.
I have seen that some television channels make positive statements specific time.
In today's era, positive news is being created.
Everybody wants to get good news and good news.
It is true that the biggest person, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the consequences, the best, the best, the consequences, the best.
It is true that if we focus more on goodness then we will not have much place for bad things.
If the lamp burns the lamp then the darkness will be removed and it will happen.
And that is why we might have been convinced that the government has started a website named Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is such a portal on which we can send good news to ourselves.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji has received good news but please don't come to me.
Kumbh is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can become the center of attraction for tourism .
Very few people in the world knew that for such a long time, millions of people come to the bank of the river.
Festival is celebrated in a peaceful and peaceful environment .
In order to organise such events, people are going to set new parameters in terms of programme management.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people have been uploading photographs of the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India has taken up such photographs from the tourism department of the State Government and urged people to take out the best photographs and upload them.
Not only should cleanliness be there, but people returning from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social festival.
I am glad that I have always linked my heart with the words of my mind with an incomplete relationship. Thank you once again.
Mann Ki Baat is always awaiting me and you too.
This time I have seen, many letters, responses, phones have come, there are many things, information and inspiration. Everybody sees something or the other, it feels a feeling and there is a lot that I have to include, but I have a limit of time.
However, I would like to once again divide yourselves into the thread of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that in the past, we had discussed some of the books of Premchand ji and some of the books that we used to share through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some other books.
But I must acknowledge that I cannot give time to save a very large number of books.
But there is only one advantage that I get the opportunity to know about the topics of many books from what you write and send.
However, from the experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to take this initiative forward.
You can make a corner of the books on the Narendra Modi App permanently and whenever we read a new book, we will write and discuss it and you can also suggest a good name for the copies of these books.
And I am feeling that today the people of India have lost their minds on the subject of water.
Many effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
The media has launched several innovative initiatives on water conservation.
Be it the government or the NGOs, they are doing something on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked to give a definite direction to a stream flowing from the mountains by working hard.
And that is also a pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil smoke and cooking but also provided water to the farmers.
All of you will be happy to know that the beautiful states of the North-East are the first states in the country to formulate their water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crops that cost less water are being encouraged and the farmers do not have any harm.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
People from every segment of society keep going in the fairs.
In these fairs, we can give the message of water conservation very effectively, showcase and play with nook and drama, along with festivals, we can deliver the message of water conservation in a very easy manner.
In fact, the World Children Winners Sports Competition was organised in Moscow this month.
This is a sportsperson in which those youngsters who have escaped from cancer, who have been fighting cancer in their lives, take part.
In the event, competitions such as negative, intellectual, liberal, running, football and table tennis were organised.
All these ten winners of our country won the medal in this competition.
Some of these players have won more than one medal.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
Many people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the year 2019 has been very high for Indias vision of space progress.
Our scientists had left the A-SAT space in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was not much discussion on big and important issues like A-SAT in the bottom of the election.
We have achieved the capability of satellites at a distance of 300 km in just three minutes.
India has become the fourth country in the world to achieve its success and it will be proud that on 22nd July, the entire country has taken its steps from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikota.
The photographs of Chandrayaan-2 filled the countrymen with pride and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this campaign is special in many ways.
Our understanding of Chandrayaan-2 will be more clear.
This will help us get more detailed information about the moon, but if you ask me what two big things have been learned from Chandrayaan-2 then I will tell you that these are two things, the fate and the fearlessness.
We have to believe in our talent and capability, we have to believe in our talent and capability.
We will be happy to hear that Chandrayaan-2 is completely in the Indian form.
He is an Indian in both heart and temper.
It is a mission of the entire indigenous system.
When there was talk of innovation and innovation in new areas, our scientists are the best, the world class.
The second important factor is that there is no need to get scared of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the way our scientists have left the Chandrayaan-2 space in order to solve all the technological questions during the record time, the day and night.
All the worlds have seen this great description of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time has not changed to reach the moon even after difficulty.
We have to face temporarily difficulties in our lives, but always remember that we have the ability to overcome it.
I am confident that Chandrayaan-2 Mission will inspire the youth of the country to innovate and innovate.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September when lander-wise and rover-technologies will descend on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the students and young friends of the country to invite the youth and the youth of the country to a very entertaining competition - a quiz competition.
I call upon young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make their participation, competition more entertaining and unforgettable.
I urge the schools, parents, enthusiastic chiefs and teachers to take a lot of care to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the most qualified students from every state to Sriharikota on their own and in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when the moon descends to the moon.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students, but you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to achieve the highest qualities and we will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done a survey.
Our minds have been able to speed up the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for cleanliness has always been inspired by the mind.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting up new standards of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal situation in terms of cleanliness, but the ways that have been achieved in terms of cleanliness from villages to public places are the strength of the resolve of 1. 3 billion people, but we will not be able to come here.
This campaign is now moving ahead from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching the statements of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has returned to India to serve Mother India, leaving her job in America.
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started with his team from the waste tanks in Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, many parts of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
When he started showing his art from the walls of overbridge and school to the slums, people also got support and in a way this silsila started.
You must remember that during the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj was decorated with paintings on the roads.
I understand that Yogesh Saini and his teams also played a very big role in it.
Even though the voices of colors and fibers do not come, the message of the indradhanush produced by the paintings made of them proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also feel the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of making wealth from waste to wealth in our society.
We have to move ahead towards making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very entertaining response to MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir, had the same response.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" programme is very good to hear.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Mobilization Programme in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
There should also be an online monitoring system of the programme.
I believe that this was the first such event in which people had directly interacted with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, I am keen to know about the Bank to Village Programme and when I got to know about it in detail, I would like to know that the entire country should be aware.
The people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are.
Several topics such as literacy, gender quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, pollution education and questions of senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a government formality, the officers returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers made a two-day stay in the Panchayat and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, sports competitions were held for children.
Literature, MNREGA's Job Card and Scheduled Tribes and Certificates of Scheduled Tribes were also found there.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great pleasure that the Bangkok to Village programme was organised in far-flung areas where government officials had to go to the remote roads and climb the mountains and sometimes have to pay a day and a half days.
These officers also went to the Panchayats across the border where there was constant fear of pillars from the border, not only in the areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, but also in the extremely sensitive areas.
Some officers were so impressed by the welcome of the village that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is very pleasant to see a large number of people participating in these villages and plans for us.
It is also obvious that people are looking at creating sensitivity on the path of development, seeing usually pedestrians, they can never succeed in our folk goals.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Awards, has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said, "Hodigae Madigae Agyed Lagna. And the land magnificent. It means rains and streams of water are burning and the earth is enchanted by their beauty.
In the whole of India, different cultures and speakers celebrate the month of Shravan.
Whenever we look around in this season, it seems as if the earth has dressed greenery.
A new energy is transmitted everywhere.
In this holy month, many devotees travel to Kavad and Amarnath, while some people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami.
During this period, Raksha Purnima is also a symbol of love of the sister-in-law.
If the discussions of the month of Shravan are going on then you will be happy to note that this time, the most emotional participants have participated in the journey of Amarnath over the last four years.
Since July till now more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave .
Emotional participants have participated in the journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, more than 28 days.
I also appreciate the success of Amarnath Yatra, especially the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those people who return from the journey are buried with the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that since this year in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time, such number of pilgrims have reached there.
I urge all of you to visit the areas where the natural beauty was visible during the monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage are not more teachers than that.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and compassionate month of Shravan.
Similarly, the month of August brings the memory of the uit India Movement.
I want you to make some special preparations for August 15 and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we see television, we will have to come out with our own families to see the soils of rains, soiled water, transport cords and other paintings on all sides, birds, flowing waterfalls and greenery.
Rainfall, freshness and joy, both freshness and happiness bring together.
My dear countrymen, where to start the news of Mann Ki Baat, where to stop, it feels very difficult, but there is a limit of time.
I extend my best wishes to all of you in the East.
My young friends, you are busy in the examination.
Today, we are often waiting for the harmony between India and Australia.
India has confronted Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in this sports world.
And we see that there is also a nutritious environment for football, hockey, tennis and kabaddi in India.
You may have come to know that India is hosting the FIFA World Football Competition under 17 years in 2017.
24 associations from all over the world will come to India to play.
On the other hand, I see that the attraction of football is increasing in the youth, whether it is EPL or Spanish link or Indian supplement.
Young friends take time to see them on television to know about these aspects.
How are the competitions to connect themselves with sports between government, educational institutions and social organizations
You can see that all this happened in the case of cricket.
However, we have to create this environment for other sports as well.
This is a golden occasion to introduce India.
My dear students, we must have decided to visit tourism during these holidays.
And I remember that the work that we did not accumulate to our tourism department was not possible to our cultural department, which the state governments could not do and the government of India could not do it was done by crores of tourists in the country.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there is no district in India where I have not gone.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am happy that nearly 10,000 people have visited the coal mine of Savaner near Nagpur as a tourist.
Some efforts are being made by both tourists and tourists .
All efforts are being made even though there are no scientific methods.
Or why do we also pay special attention
I am sure my young friends will help me in this work.
Employment is possible through tourism sector.
In terms of tourism India is far behind in comparison to the world .
But if we decide to focus on the tourism sector, we can attract the world towards India.
By attracting a large part of the tourism sector around the world towards our country, millions of youth of our country can create employment opportunities.
Whether it is government or institutions, society or citizens, we all have to work together.
Let us try to do this.
My young friends, the leaflets have come and I don't seem to be right in the past.
If you are not able to swim, then you must learn to swim in these beds.
If the cycle cannot be run, then the cycle cannot be taught in these tablets.
Even today while typing the computer on the computer I do with two fingers , should I not learn to do clean typing
We have a lot of skills for development of our personality.
You will be able to see that after the start of the school after the holidays, you will go back to the school and tell your friend that I have learned this holiday and you will say that if you don't learn anything.
My time has come and you have learnt new.
Friends, this will be mutually discussed.
There have been several reports on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
In the last holidays of the sun we had told that the chimneys also had the problem of sun , for this keep a vessel filled with water in your balcony or thread for the chimneys .
I have done the same thing and I am happy to say that this has led to my friendship with the chimneys.
He telephone and reminded me of a knife work.
Last time I was in my mind and I had said that during the summer, the birds should fill the water in the clay vessels outside their grass.
He told me that he does this for the whole year and he has been friendly with many fools.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet of Hindi literature, had a lot of love for birds.
He had written in his poem, I would not let you go away, I would give you a courtyard with donors and I would fill you with salt and sweet leaves.
Let us also do this thing that Mahadeva ji said.
I congratulate and also express my gratitude for bringing in mind a very important issue.
Have we ever given them water in the days of summer
I am extremely grateful to you and you have made a sensitive subject very easily.
Yes, this is a habit in India.
But I express my gratitude to you for seeing the sculpture.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard that Digital India - Digital India.
Some people think that Digital India is only the world of youth in the city.
But it is not so.
You will be happy to hear that a farmer facility has been prepared for your service.
If we download the farming facility in our mobile phones then we will be able to get a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this farm facility on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Summer is the time of holiday for others, but the summer is the time for the farmers to sweat.
He waits for the rain.
The time before the commencement of the direct season of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think about what will happen to us by drinking water.
The ponds, water flowing drains, the way to water in the ponds, where some waste is accumulated or some invasions have occurred, the water flow stops and the water storage slowly decreases.
First of all, save water in the rains, fill the ponds and the river drains and then if the rain does not fall then it will be a loss.
You must have seen that we have decided to build five lakh farmers.
Emphasis has been made to create water resources for water conservation through Manrega.
There are so many villages across the country, how many progressive farmers, how aware they have done this thing.
However, there is a need to work even more today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I am going to repeat one thing today and the Government of India had recently organized a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technologies have come into the field.
However, it is yet to reach out to the direct farm.
Now the farmers have also begun to reduce the use of fertilizer.
We have to follow this mantra and take our agricultural sector forward using scientific methods.
I hope that in one or two months we will complete the required work done to save water.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Vijay on diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day here.
It is said that in 2014, the institutions of diabetes patients in India were about Rs.
3 percent of deaths have been found to be due to diabetes.
The entire world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th April, World Health Day, it has been decided to conquer diabetes.
We all know that our lifestyle is the main cause of type-2 diabetes .
If you like yogasanas then do yogasanas.
Otherwise do exercise to walk or run at least .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we feel hesitant to examine health.
And when the health is very bad then it is seen that diabetes has pushed our body a long time ago.
This means that this is such a disease which is possible to get quick check up done .
My dear countrymen, we have a lot of work in this regard.
I would like to tell you that whether it is tuberculosis or diabetes, we will do its best.
And therefore, I urge all the people of the country to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
One Panchthirtha - his birthplace here is Mahu .
Wherever he took higher education, Nagpur, where he took initiation.
I am fortunate to visit Mahu on the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to become a better citizen.
By conducting the path shown by him, we can pay great tributes to him by being an excellent citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Savvtsar will start and the new Vikram Savtsar will come.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can hear your mobile phone.
We just have to give a missed call.
We have missed calls, according to your convenience.
If you want to hear the previous programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can hear it and you can hear it in your language.
I am happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you.
How can this worldwide enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
Let us also join it.
He sent photographs of some such sites that he was really happy to see them.
If you want to see something like Shauk-e-Didar, then you should first create a sight.
They should want to reach wherever no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Savaner place near Nagpur, has coal mines.
When people visit tourist places, they buy some or the other or the other.
Even if he is poor, he will spend more if he is sweet.
I urge you to think about one thing.
Would we commit any new art and skills in these beds to achieve a new thing in our personality
Why should not you increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not you come
Hey, let's start and come.
You must use holidays for personality development, to learn new arts and to increase skills.
There are innumerable areas.
The sculpture cook of Mysore has put a sensitive issue before all of us.
Whenever you ask them a question, they answer it, explain it to you.
And once you use it, what is your usefulness in it
And yet, if you want to do something, then you should urge me to do it.
I want to save water in the villages and villages.
How can not the drops of water be saved in the coming rains
How will the water of the village remain in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have made our mother sick due to the use of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices, will you want to eat food
You don't like that food.
But today we have become inadequate about tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my heart from the radio.
The ideas of testing will continue in your mind.
I also want to join you in your journey.
The more you look at the tests of your children, the more I feel.
But if we change our vision to look at the exam then we can become worry-free.
I had told you in the backdrop of my Mann Ki Baat program that you should send your experiences and your information to the Narendra Modi Power.
I am glad that the students who have achieved great success in their lives, the beneficiaries of the society have written a lot of things to me.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, students and teachers from the news programme.
I will tell you something about what I have heard and what I have read and what I have been told.
But I believe that my 25-30-minute interaction will certainly be useful to those students who are going to meet the examination.
My dear student friends, if I start talking to you, today's Mann Ki Baat from a well-known Opener in the world, how will they be useful while reaching the heights of success in life
Their experiences will definitely be beneficial to you.
I am aware that the examinations will start in a few days.
Some of you must have been under stress.
I have only one message.
Your mother-in-law will keep you from you, your teachers will keep you, other members of your family will keep your friends.
If you go anywhere then you will all think about how your preparations are going on.
How many percent qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
In the last 24 years, many difficult moments have come and sometimes good moments have come.
But the expectations of the people were always there and as the time continued to grow, it continued to grow.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
Then I thought that I would expect myself and set my own goal.
My attention was focused on tears and then all the goals were being achieved from you.
Friends, What were you saying
Don't go under the burden of hope.
You have to make your future.
Why should you spend your time in competing with others
You will see that nobody can stop you from moving forward and you will not need to stay dependent on any other person to enjoy your happiness if you are able to achieve more success than the previous success.
You will feel self-confidence.
Friends, Do not accept the game of tests, quality and data.
Where did we get, how much did we get
Or don't get stuck in the sympathy.
It is known from these exams whether we have the right direction or not.
And that is why if your dreams are immense, huge then the test will be a festival of happiness on its own.
And that is why what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited at all .
Please move ahead with a great goal and if there is less success than that then there will be no disappointment, it will be inspired to make more efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from my powers and their mobile phones.
However, for the whole year, 365 days, our daily routine, our dreams and imaginations must be consistent.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddy gave me a phenomenon that he wrote on the occasion of sleeping and waking up early in the morning and brightening the practice.
Shri Prabhakar Reddi said that along with the entrance papers and other essential things, the test should be reached at the center at the time.
I don't have the courage to say that because I am not so serious about sleep.
And many of my friends have a complaint that I don't take enough sleep.
During the examination, I talk about sleeping in order to test you in a stress-free state.
Will you not do this
I am sure I will not do it.
It is an important reason for the foundation of success to be stable in life.
Not only this, the daily routine also worsens.
And that's why don't you understand anything small and smooth.
Deciding, do it.
The negative impact of those tensions which are under these tensions is on their drive.
And on the basis of the study I have done, I will leave any question paper on the basis of such confidence that if any question paper comes, then they leave it with determination.
Let us know the way to achieve success by giving a blasphemy to this test.
Namaskar I am Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me start by conveying my best wishes to you for the examination.
I am going to tell you about how I was going for my exams.
I am aware that the tests are similar to the problems that come after you.
You should rest properly , you should take peaceful sleep at night , you should eat all the stomach , you must not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should remain calm .
All this is like the left of intellect.
When you play, you don't know what kind of tyranny is going to come out, in the same way, you don't know what questions will come in the examination
That is why if you are calm and you have eaten all over the stomach , if you have sleeped properly then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
That's why I was quiet.
Do not give more stress to yourself , do not keep too much hope .
This is important, look at this as a challenge. Why should I ask for what I have been taught in the year
Recall the most important thing that you don't remember at the last minute, you might remember some occasions with teachers or students while examining and this will help you to remember a lot about that.
If you face difficult questions then you will come to know that it is a new question for you and then when you test it then you will be able to get it better.
So calm down, take a good sleep at night, do not show high confidence but do not be disappointed at the same time.
I have always seen that these tests are better than you were scared.
And you must have seen them while playing international intellectuals.
However, it is difficult to say this, but we must try to do it.
If you don't talk to friends, you go alone, you will be like a goat, you will not be quiet until the last minute.
If the water is calm then it is also seen deep but if the surface of the water is dissolved then nothing below is visible .
At that time it feels the tension of the inside .
Then I feel that if you take some rest then you will feel good.
I have developed a system for that.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, thrice and five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds, but after this my mind was quiet and my mind was ready to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will be useful to you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
Whatever my power writes, we must spend time with our friends and families at least half a day.
And what do you do
Friends, do not do this.
If you have ever gone to some place with your parents, then let me remember that moment, get out of this test and give it for at least half an hour.
This is what Rajat ji said.
Friends, will I tell you about peace
Today, before you have been tested, a person has sent a message to you that those who are originally teachers and have become a culture teacher.
He is trying to reach out to the world and all over the country by connecting this great book with the present.
The revered Murari Bapu has described the students as a clue.
Friends, I want to tell you one more thing today.
G.
But one thing is certain that Yoga is a gurukilli in the journey of development of half the integration of life.
You must pay attention to this.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have to go to the examination centre, don't you feel like going back and sitting on your back
Otherwise there is tension in the mind .
If you understand these information then you will not have the time to retreat.
I have also seen that the form of a question paper has changed.
Shri Rao highlighted the patience in his message.
Even in at least words, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao says.
I am fully aware that there is uneasiness due to competitive examinations.
Do not take care .
I tell all my young friends that give you the best.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities in this country.
Deciding what you have to do in life and do not leave it, you will be successful.
Don't forget that you are the lakes of this world, you have the right to live here like trees and mountains.
You need it for sermons, dedication and jealousy.
These qualities will make you successful in all the tests and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you for what you want to do.
Many blessings.
"How is a scientific way of telling questions in the public
It takes me half an hour to say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientists.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of Dedication, Determination and Diligence.
Friends, I am happy to be here.
If you stand firmly then you will also get scared.
And the golden future will wait for you to be empowered by your hands.
Ruchika Dabbs has sent a message to my power.
And this is true, Sachin ji also said that positive attitude, positive conditions of mind, positive energy.
It is sometimes a lot of things that inspire us, do not think that only students get inspiration.
At any moment of life, at any point of time, best generosity and truthful events inspire us, gives us a lot of strength and at the time of crisis, it can lead to a new path on the strength of this inspiration.
In the course of the course, we read the information about Power Division's father Thomas Alva Edison.
Friends, how many years have they spent for this research, how many times they had to afford, the time has gone and the money has also been spent.
Even though he did not have any special education for mathematics, Ramanujan laid emphasis on various fields such as mathematics classification, Ankasiddhaant.
K.
Rolling himself said that this power was important for them.
Today, the examination is not only of students but also of all the families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal said that his parents should not bear the burden of our expectations.
And we don't like this, but we don't like to get hands with all that.
We feel that we should also progress at a rapid pace of science.
This is the reason why today is the National Science Day.
He became the standard of Nobel Prize for this research.
And as a memorial, we celebrate 28 February as National Science Day all over the country.
Curiosity is the birth of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to scientific ideas in every mind, everybody's attraction for science and new research.
New research is not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, new research should be encouraged all over the country.
"I am Sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success comes, our vision to see the world also changes.
You must have heard that in the past few days, there has been a great and important research in the world of science.
Scientists from all over the world have enjoyed, many generations have come and they have read something or the other.
This research found out the principles of great scientist Einstein of the last century, not only this, it has become a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire human society will be beneficial to the entire world.
We are proud and happy to be an Indian that our country's sons and skilled scientists were also present in this research process.
Our scientists will try to further this new research in the coming days.
India will be a part of the international efforts.
And, my countrymen, a recent decision has been taken in this regard.
The government has decided to set up a Lesser Interface Meter Gravitational Wave Observer (LIGO) in India to achieve the next stage of research.
There are two such centres in the world, third in India.
Indias participation will provide a new energy and a new dimension.
India will be actively participating in this great scientific research of human welfare on the strength of limited resources.
My dear countrymen, I tell you the number one.
You will be able to hear the message of mind from tomorrow by giving a missed call on this number.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
The number of missed calls is 81908 81908 I reiterate 81908 81908.
Friends, Your examinations are going on and I am also going to be tested tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my exams.
Yesterday, I was tested that you will start the festival.
And when we all succeed, the country will succeed.
Friends, I convey my best wishes to you.
Out of the stress of success, we have to move forward with a free mind.
In the last consignment Mann Ki Baat, I said two things.
Recently, we celebrated Christmas and now we have started preparations for a new year's welcome.
India has been diversified.
Celebrations are a movement of festivals.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is based on celebrations.
Whether it is a crisis-free, terrorism, global temperature increases, natural crisis or human-made, drying and peace of all human beings, is it a great pleasure
You know that I use a lot of technologies. I get a lot of information about various topics.
I always see this portal MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas holidays .
There is a special focus on providing all the facilities to the tourists in the tourism sector, but Sayswarkar said that wherever there are tourist places, there are religious places, there should be a special focus on cleanliness.
And as a guest, we say that when we are coming to visit our houses then we clean the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we have to pay special attention to the cleanliness of our tourist destinations and religious places.
Deep Singh Malviya lives in Bhojpura village in Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh at a young age.
I thought he had come to read and had to reach you.
Deep Singh Malviya, who lives in Chhotayashya village, decided that if anybody provides the goods to build toilets in the village then he will not be able to afford the construction, he will be able to make the construction of toilet free.
Deep Singh built a hundred toilets in Bhojpura village, considering the construction of toilets as a sacred work.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Deep Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing rapidly due to the unprecedented efforts of many people.
When every Indian knows that all people have been attracted to Yoga, and the entire world celebrated International Yoga Day and all the world is connected then we believe that this is our Hindustan.
This belief, this feeling is created in our minds when we see a unique form.
The topic of cleanliness is now discussed in a way at home.
They increase the participation of the citizens.
What is the biggest benefit of this thing that the government employees who used to provide electricity to the villages will get relief and they will be able to transform the lives of a village through the medium of transforming the lives of a village, they will get the pleasure of providing these things to the farmers, the poor, the women or the youth
They have the right to get that thing and they should not be able to reach it for what government has done and what kind of transgression has not done.
We all have to make efforts to reach the right thing, good things and the useful things of the common man.
This is in a way a service.
I have made a small effort on me.
I can't do this alone, but when I tell you, I should not do anything.
We have to reach 1. 25 billion Indians.
How can I reach without your help
In the language of the common man, let us inspire them to reach them and get their rights.
My young friends, in the address from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had discussed the theme Start-up India Stand-up India.
After that, the work started in every account of the government and in every department.
Can India be the world capital in terms of start-ups
Innovative ways, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it production, service sector or agriculture.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments, new efforts are needed and the world will not move forward.
Start up India, Stand up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India will be presenting the full action plan of Start-up India Stand-up India.
However, we have to change it as per the needs of India.
Our young friend is expected to put a research on the hard work and hard work of a poor person.
I urge the State Governments to take initiatives in this regard.
On January 16, I will speak to you more detailedly.
I will always welcome your information.
Dear Youth Friends, 12 January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, millions of people of this country have been inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 12 January 1995.
This year, the event will be held at Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
I believe that this is the vision of Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormony.
He observed the Ease of Doing Business Day in his school and expressed his feelings on the telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people working in the society, there are many ideas in the mind.
Now it is true that every word has its own importance.
This year, the Government of India had launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, but I was not able to attend the programme of the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan because of some of the districts of Tamil Nadu, especially the Mahapur in Chennai.
But I was thinking about going to that programme.
I thought that instead of the word 'Divyang' should be used in our country.
These are those people with whom there are only or more parts that have the communication of divine power, which are not with a strong people like us.
I liked this word a lot.
Will the people of my country now propagate the word 'Divyang' instead of 'Divyang'
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
The needed infrastructure reforms have been brought into force, directly and indirectly, to provide accessible campuses to the people with disabilities.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, ramps at railway stations, easy parking, accessible entrepreneurship, braillepreneurs, etc.
They liked this.
We must also participate in it in our way.
My dear countrymen, the government schemes continue to come, but this scheme should not only be artificial but also be aware of it.
It should reach the last segment.
Their breath should not be repeated in files .
Because these schemes are being implemented, the Government of India has made an effort a few days ago to provide benefits to the common man, to the poor and to the needy.
Grants are given to LPG cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth crores of rupees but we did not have a system of guarantee that the beneficiaries could not reach it at the right time.
The government has made some changes in it.
The worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme has been implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhaar Card and the amount of subsidy has begun to be deposited in the beneficiaries' bank accounts.
I would like to assure you that this initiative, as the worlds largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
This scheme is known by the name of Pahal.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries of the scheme.
This grant has started directly deposited in the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for any recommendation, there is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar Card, the opening of Jan Dhan Accounts, on the other hand, and on the other hand, the state government and the central government are joining the list of beneficiaries, connecting them with Aadhaar numbers and accounts.
A few days ago, MNREGA will provide employment opportunities in the villages.
There were many complaints about it.
I am confident that about 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a golden moment on the Indian Republic Day.
The centenary year of Babasaheb Ambedkars birth anniversary is the centenary year of Rupya Mahotsav.
A two-day special discussion was held in Parliament on this occasion and it was very good.
All the parties have discussed the purity of the conflict, the importance of the conflict, the basic definition of the conflict. We must continue this initiative.
Can the work of connecting people with power and power with people be done on the day of Republic Day
There should be discussions and discussions about the fact that the settlement has given us a lot of rights.
The time of the elections is enlightened all around, there is a huge glimpse written on the walls that voting is our holy duties.
Why doesn't it happen in our daily lives as our duties are discussed during voting
On the occasion of 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, what is the need to organise essay competitions, poetry competitions and lecture competitions on schools, colleges, duties in villages and society institutions in the city on 26th January
If 1. 25 billion Indians take a step after taking a step with duties then it will be a great history.
I want to know your ideas.
Send your writings to my portal MyGov.
I would like to know what the younger generations of my country think about.
And I don't speak from the government level.
We build the statues of great men with great faith, but then we are eager to take care of them.
On the other hand, the preparation of cotton has also started.
Festivals have a significance in society.
Sometimes this festival bursts on sadness and sometimes makes it new .
But sometimes if there is a crisis during these festivals then it is very painful .
The news of natural calamities is coming from every corner of the world.
There are reports of such natural calamities that you have never heard or have not thought.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is happening.
The way in which there has been heavy rains and untimely rains in our country and the way in which Tamil Nadu has suffered losses and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I have participated in the tragedy of all those families.
The State Governments are working with full strength and help.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis in Tamil Nadu, he will start moving forward with confidence and the role that he plays in the development of the country will be over.
But when we see crisis all around, we need to make many changes in this.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector because natural calamities were limited to that time.
Today, it is changing.
We need to increase our capabilities at every level.
For this, the government, society, citizens and all small institutions will have to work from the point of view of science.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I interacted with Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif and suggested that we should come together and conduct a joint exercise to combat disasters.
I am happy that the workshop on SAARC countries was held in Delhi on discussions and excellent measures.
A good beginning has been made.
Today, Lakhvinder Singh telephone me from Jalandhar, Punjab.
I am speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab, Lakhvinder Singh.
We make organic farming here and guide many to this farming.
My question is, those people who have littered in the fields or the plants of wheat cannot be able to see how the bacteria of the earth die and how will they get rid of the pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab
I am very happy to hear your question.
You are not only organic farming but also you are well aware of the problems of farmers.
Your concern is a way, but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of the people of all over India and in a traditional way we burn the remains of the crops.
But the pain that you have expressed is right.
The first step on this is to train our farmers brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them the situation of truth that if the remains of the crops are burnt then the crops will be made for the next crops.
But this is not true.
We destroy them but if we make these ruins small pieces then it will be a dry cattle for the animals.
Secondly , after burning this the upper surface of the earth burns .
My farmer brothers and sisters, for some time, think that our bones should be strong, our hearts should be strong and kidneys should be good but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is alright we can not live .
Just as the skin of our body is burnt then it is difficult to stay alive , in the same way the pieces of the pieces burn not only on the burning sensation but also the skin of the dami mother burns .
Animals will not only be used as a grasshopper, but they will also be benefitted by putting the fertilizer produced in the same land.
The water in those pearls is sufficient for that cooking and today their pearls have also received pearls.
They have also been getting income from these pegs.
Today, the pulses that had to be spent for sanitation have also become a source of income and their demands are increasing.
Dear countrymen, this day will be celebrated on 3rd December as International Disabilities Day all over the world.
The 27th of November was celebrated as "Indian Organ Day".
Several renowned personalities including filmmaker Ravina Tandon participated in the event.
Because of organ donation many precious lives can be saved .
Organ donation offers immortality in a way .
When an organ goes to another body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be better than this
A National Registration on Organ Transplantation has been launched on 27th November for patients, organ dentals and organ transplants waiting for transplantation.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this sector and the needy will get the best possible help because no one can get this help unless he donates organs.
As I said earlier, 3 December is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also adventurous and capable .
When such persons are ignored, they are tortured.
Sometimes they are shown grace.
But if we change our vision to see them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live life.
You can inspire me to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
When we remember that my crisis is very small.
How will this be our lives
How do you do the work
And that is why these are all inspirations for us.
It is the power to reverse their resolve power, their way of living and their crisis.
I want to talk to him today, I want to say that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Ahmad was shot by the terrorists in Kashmir.
One part of the abdomen and intestines is also lost .
He also suffered severe injury.
He ruined the strength to stand on our feet, but Ahmed did not believe in it.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How to develop facilities for disabled people in public places, government offices
He is working on these things.
Whether their lives are not sufficient to become inspirational in every corner of the country
I am going to remember him on the 3rd of December as his work, his dedication and dedication.
I am not only supposed to have to go but many such inspirations have been inspired in every corner of the country.
They are giving new lights to live and show new ways.
Be it the middle class, the poor, the deprived, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the deprived and the deprived, the government and the government system have been continuously connected with the system and as a citizen, sometime or the other government employees have had a bad experience and some other bad experience changes their vision to look at the government system throughout the life.
There are also facts in this regard, but lakhs of people of this government do such a good work with service and dedication that never looks at it.
Last year, we had given joint Padma Bhushans to both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
He works in a large number of social works in India.
He has spent the time after his pension and what he has earned for the entire life for the poor.
Whenever he comes to India, he appreciates the hope that he has got the opportunity to work with the workers and tells him how dedicated this hope works and suffers.
He tells them about how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovation.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha gave a special honor to a ASHA worker on the Independence Day.
And a hope worker of this village, Jamuna Mani Singh, decided that I will not let anyone from Tedagaon die due to malaria.
If they go to every household, if they know that there is a slight fever.
There will be many more such people.
Millions of people will be around us.
We have a little respect for them.
Such people become the greatest strength of our country.
How to become a big partner of the joy and grief of society
I extend my warm greetings to all those ASHA workers through Jamuna Mani.
My dear Youth Friends, I especially for younger generations who are active on internet and social media.
Not only this, they can also show to others, it can be said that we will be able to add something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to join this nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change and global temperature increase are being discussed everywhere, there is also care and every work is now being accepted as a standard before.
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore.
This is also the responsibility of everybody and care.
And the first way to prevent temperature is to save energy.
December 14 is the National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, the lights of the road should be closed and darkened for an hour.
You should feel the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan on TV in Kanpur it seems that she has not got the opportunity to learn a lot .
But he is doing such a thing that perhaps nobody has thought about it.
They are shining the lives of the poor by using solar energy.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening our legs.
He has constituted a committee of women and started a factory of solar powered woods and paid a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
What kind of help is being given to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, empowerment.
The speed at which I have to go continuously is all the time to come.
But the beginning has become better.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have got Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it is a newspaper seller or a milk seller or a small businessman, I am happy that out of 66 lakhs, there are 24 lakh women and there are Scheduled Tribes and other Backward Classes, who are trying to run their families with dignity by standing on their feet.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
There are many news about me too.
Someone just told me that somebody in Mumbai is a friend.
During my Swachhta Mission, I had said that the Swachhta Mission is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and Shailesh Bhosle has shown it.
And I am told that in such a short span of time, he has also returned two lakh rupees to the bank.
He is working to build potatoes.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor.
These people actually run the economy of the country.
Small industrialists are the economic powers of the country.
We have to further strengthen it.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, I had discussed the Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st October.
These are the things that should continue to be aware of social life.
Efficiency under the Rashtriya Jagriyam Yame is an award for freedom.
How should the programme be started
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that there was a lot of information.
But I am expecting more information.
I expect a very special scheme.
There can be a lot of things like this.
I am confident that our information will definitely be useful.
But I would urge you to exercise.
In order to keep the body fit , use some time of this excellent season for exercise .
If there is a rainy season then also make the habits of snacks.
My best wishes to my countrymen once again.
I once again meet you with Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day cricket between India and South Africa is being played.
The Cricket Malike is named Gandhi-Mandela Siriz.
Both the Unions have won each others face-to-face and therefore, the importance of our last meeting has increased certainly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I want to convey my best wishes that whenever I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, many people went to visit these events, the 12th students of Kerala also joined the programme.
I once again have to talk about Kerala.
The students of the St. Mary Upper Primary School of Kochia Chittor in Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't understand that these children made me a map of India with fingerprints.
When I read his letters, I realized that he had given a big symbolic message.
So that body part donation becomes a habit and habit .
Those girls have written a letter and have written to me that you should challenge people about organ donation from your Mann Ki Baat programme.
Sudke Guru ji, the 80-year-old spring of Maharashtra, has always started a movement.
He said that organ donation should be a festival.
Hello, I have a lot of messages from the telephone.
Devesh in Delhi has also given me a message.
I think this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidneys, hearts and liver.
But only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplants are operated in our country with a population of 1.25 crore .
Every year one lakh dollars are required but only 25,000 people get eyes .
When we need four dollars, we can only move one dollar.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have done a good job to speed up the efforts of our organ donation by reducing paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, a lot of NGOs have worked well and have given a different direction.
The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTO) has been established to give importance to organ transplant.
The joy that was sacrificed by Ten Tatken Bhunjitha is the best.
Last month, we all had seen on TV that G.
A life was saved.
Dear countrymen, now we have celebrated Navaratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
A few days later, we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid was celebrated and Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated.
But we are going to celebrate another festival in all of them, we will be proud of the country and it will be proud of the country.
The India-Africa Foren Sammelan will be organised in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October.
For the first time in India, such a big event will be organised.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of India is as much as the population of Africans.
If both populations are collected then this population will be one-third of the worlds population.
And it is said that the landscapes of these two countries were together millions of years ago.
Later, the Indian Ocean was divided into two parts.
And look at this kind of effort that people should also meet and come together.
The HRD Ministry has organized a big programme on this occasion.
An essay competition was organised in the children of the schools, the programme of poems and poems was organized to enhance their participation.
Nearly 1600 schools participated.
It included schools in India and outside India and thousands of schoolchildren had written to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar to Memorial of Mahatma, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is going from Porbandar to Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren have seen this exhibition and people from villages have also seen this exhibition.
They knew how much Mahatma Gandhi had played a major role in the relations between Africa and India, and how much was the impact of Mahatma Gandhis personality on these two lands.
Although I see that India-Africa Summit is but I see this opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate more than 1600 schools and HRD Ministry for the summer and the children participating in it.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
In the last month, there was a workshop in Bhopal in which there was a strong discussion on the Adarsh Gram Yojana, where the Adarsh Gram was being constructed.
Some enthusiastic things have come to the fore.
He has selected Parsi Gram Panchayati village in Kunti district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
In the Adarsh village, a successful effort was made to make people aware of the infrastructure and systems in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate the respected Parliamentarian Shri Yut Kariya Mundanji.
I got a news from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana, a member of Andhra Pradesh, and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat as an ideal village in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
About 550 adult illiterates were taught by those children and they were literate.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special system, but how big changes are made due to will power are being seen due to village panchayats.
Our respected Parliamentarian Shri Yut C.
L. Ruwala, a member of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khwalahilang village as an ideal village.
This village is very famous for production of sugarcane and jaggery .
How to make the village a economic centre, how to market the production of the village.
Ruwala ji, who is trying to make a self-sufficient village along with Adarsh village, is eligible for greetings.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and it will never happen to be a matter of cleanliness
I would like to remind you, my dear countrymen, after the celebrations of Diwali last year, the media had launched a special mission.
The way we dont worry about the accident before the festival, we should do it even after the celebrations.
And I specially congratulate the media world of India for this.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, I have come to join the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan by India Today Group.
He was watching the dreams given by the Clean India Awards in the manner in which efforts are being made.
How are people working as One Life, One Mission for this
How are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, I have seen the e-Nadu of Andhra Telangan and especially Shri Yut Ramuji Rao, they are very old, but their enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
He has linked 51 lakh children from around 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is any public place or station or religious place or park, a big campaign on cleanliness has been carried out at some places.
Now this news shows the strength to realize this dream of a Swachh Bharat automatically.
ABP News launched a programme called Bharat Bharat Hai Mera and made people aware about sanitation and worked to train the people of the country.
NDTV has launched a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shri Yutshanmukh Nathan, he has written a letter to me and mentioned the village of Mavalyanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has raised the issue of cleanliness.
Approximately every generation is dedicated to sanitation, it is said that a few years ago he had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia.
This is important that we all have to believe that our country will be clean and it will be with the efforts of the people of the country, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be proudly telling the people of 100 crore people.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, I had said this from the Red Fort, there are some things where corruption has put in place.
We hear all these reports and that is why I came to my mind that what is the need for internet for small jobs.
I have never heard that in this world there is a psychologist who can fully recognize a person taking one or two minutes .
And I had announced that we would stop the tradition of childhood for these small jobs.
My dear young friends, I am proud to say that the government has completed all these processes and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be married during the recruitment.
The Rule will apply from 1st January, 2016 and wherever the recruitment process is going on, we will not be able to afford it, but it will apply from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
Gold has become an important part of social life in our country.
Gold can become power, gold can become economic power.
And every Indian needs to contribute in this.
Under this, we can deposit our gold in the Gold Bank and the bank will pay you interest as you deposit your money and earn interest.
Earlier we had to keep gold in the locker and also pay the locker's rent.
Now keep the gold in the bank and the bank will pay you interest.
You people of the country, can't you become gold wealth
The second thing is this bond in the Sovereign Gold bond, but the value of that paper is gold.
On the day when this paper will be returned, on the day of return you will get the amount of gold, the price and the money you will get back.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quins.
It took nearly 70 years after the independence of the Golden uain bringing Ashok Chakra, but till now we have been using the Foren Gold uain.
Gold Billion Bonds are also used abroad.
We are also going to provide it to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks and we are starting a golden coin with five grams and a ten grams Ashoka Chakra.
20 grams of gold will be available for the people.
I am confident that the new schemes will bring about a new change towards economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel.
One India-Shreshtha Bharat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel recalls that India's map comes out.
This great man has contributed immensely to the unity of India.
India is full of diversity.
Several texts, many sects, many dialects, many species, many circumstances, how many different India is filled with and this diversity is our beauty and beauty.
If this is not a diversity then we cannot pride and pride in this glory and beauty.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the real roots of development.
Last few years, on 31st October, there will be a run-for-unity programme in every corner of the country.
Ekta Ki Daud is also a true path of development.
Bless Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, now you are engaged in the preparation of Diwali, the house will be cleaned.
You are buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the pilgrimage of Diwali.
The blisters start burning and the blisters cause a lot of damage to the children.
I would like to tell every parents that the joy of Diwali is lost but don't let an accident happen, don't harm the child of our family and you will think and you will have to clean it.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be visiting Britain.
The Government of India and the State Governments give scholarships to children who are part of these sections of society, be it tribals or backwards, who go abroad for study.
I am confident that when our children will be taught in Britain then Babasaheb's place will become a motivational place, Babasaheb has given this message to the country that I am thrilled by my visit to Britain.
You can imagine how many people like me will be happy that this building has become a wealth of 125 crore Indians.
I will get another opportunity in London and will unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
Several years ago, the world needs to study the work done by Lord Vishweshwar for democracy and for the Empirement of Women.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how many years ago the great men of India thought and thought about the vision.
My dear countrymen, you were connected with Mann Ki Baat.
He was interacting with government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve their problems.
We must learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn how many languages are there
But I am grateful to Akashwani that at 8 o'clock in the night of this Mann Ki Baat in every state in their regional language.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes once again.
Jai Hind.
On the 3rd of October of Galle, I will be fortunate to talk about Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
Peoples power in democracy is immensely important.
There is a fundamental idea in my life and that is why I have a constant faith in manpower.
But from what I learned from the news of Mann Ki Baat, from what I felt, I can tell you that the peoples power is unconscious than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Jana Janadan is a part of God.
From the experiences of Mann Ki Baat, I can say that there is a great strength in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I was asking the people for information about Mann Ki Baat, only two or four information I had to see.
However, millions of people were active and sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people used to see this, they used to feel that the feelings of indifference and misery of girls would have to be changed.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of the tourism destinations in India, I told the citizens, Incredible India, incomparable India, I would like to see that you have sent a tangled picture of tourism to me on the neck.
Millions of photographs have been sent by people from every part of India.
The tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have never felt that we have such a rich heritage.
All the things have come on a platform and the government has not spent one rupee in it.
People have done all this.
Today, I am extremely happy to say that the sale of khadi has doubled in the last one year.
I used to tell you once in the message of Mann Ki Baat, we see that the poor people are crying in their houses.
Do not they want to get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a catalyst for social change.
Every small thing was considered to be a small issue and tried to connect itself to the country.
What can be a greater joy than this
I would like to make a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I have requested the citizens of the country to send your questions, your information and your proposals to me from the telephone.
I will pay attention to the news of Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy that more than five and a half thousand phones have come from all over the country, be it Citizens, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no such state in India where the people have not called on the phone.
This is a kind of pleasant experience.
The people of all the age groups asked them to say.
I heard some of them my team works on the other issues.
You might have taken one or two minutes to telephone, but the problems, ideas and issues that have been received for me are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
I am aware of the importance of radio for such blind people.
I see from a new perspective and many good things, good issues, are enough for the government to become sensitive.
I would like to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the people of India to use more and more soil plates in Diwali.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the army for two-three hours.
The naval personnel and the Air Force that protects water, land and sky.
The war that took place in 1965 with Pakistan completed fifty years.
We have not only heard about the pride of the war, the moments of pride, the courage of our soldiers and sacrifices, but also the system of photographing and telephone is not available.
Whether it is Hajifir's fight, whether it is in the north or in Chamida, it is a thrill on the organs and the pride of the Indian Army is inspired by seeing the scene of victory near Hajifir Pass.
If you want to make history then you will have to understand the small issues.
Because of history, our bonds remain with our children.
If we break away from history then the possibility of making history gets a complete break.
A young boy has instructed the Prime Minister, but in a hurry he forgot to tell his name.
I have announced the campaign on 2nd October in the context of Swachh Bharat. And I can tell you that for the first time since independence, there is a lot of discussion on the subject of cleanliness and cleanliness in the Parliament.
Our government was also criticised.
I also have to hear a lot that Modi ji was talking about cleanliness but what did you do
I don't feel bad by listening to this, but it gives me a good thing that there are discussions about the cleanliness of India in the Parliament of the country.
On the other hand, on the other hand, when these small children of the country talk about cleanliness then there can be no such thing for the country.
This movement is going on, it seems to be creating awareness about ideas, deliberations on dirt and cleanliness.
This will also make the government functional and it will be imperative to work.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we will work towards that direction to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
We are convinced, what does Mahatma Gandhi say
At one place, he said that if there is a time to choose one of the two freedom and hygiene then I will give priority to hygiene and hygiene.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi, MyGov.
My dear countrymen, we get constant inspiration from the lives of great men.
It is not your duty to assess the ideals that these great men were considered.
All those who live for the country and die for the country are inspiring us.
These days are an opportunity to remember all these great men.
On 25th September, innumerable names like Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jaiprakash Narayan Ji, on 11th October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be mentioned.
You should take any date and the name of some great man will be linked to that date from the sight of history.
Especially for 2nd October, I once again invite you.
On 2nd October, worshipped Bapu is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot be done by executing a large amount of publicity is due to a small act and help.
I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, my mind is delighted by one thing.
Chandra Bose had arranged all the arrangements with the architect of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took this task in mind and in the last week, there was a firm report that more than 50 of Subhash Babu's family members will be visiting the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
He will get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence, together, at the forefront of Netaji.
But I am glad that there has never been a visit to the Prime Minister's residence before, which I will get the privilege to do in October.
More than 50 sons, family members, some people from different countries, all the issues will come to the fore.
How happy is it for me
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about the registration of the voter, which will increase the participation of the youngsters in the coming days and will help the younger generation to choose and run the government in the future.
I hope that those youngsters who have not yet registered their names will be registered and they will also be sure to vote.
The 7th student of Kshitij Pandey met me at the Anarash Hindu University, the 7th edition of the central school is the same.
He has a strong confidence.
I have seen that at this younger age I would have read a lot.
The daughter of Sadavat Patel, who lives in Sundarpur in Varanasi.
He said that if we take the three mathematics books in the hands then by the evening we open all the mouths and history.
We all seem surprised that I was very impressed.
Sometimes such children have the pride of reputation, but I don't know anything about Sonam.
I feel that God has given a power.
My visit to Kashi has come to the forefront of meeting two children.
Similarly, the visit of these two children will be in my mind.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are inspiring me to do new things.
This is what Sandeep of Haryana says that Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once in a month, do it every week because you get a lot of inspiration by listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what will you do with me
I have to do a lot of work even once in a month and I have to make a plan on time.
Currently, there is a place once in a month.
In a way, one year will be fulfilled.
You know how much to use Subhash Babu radio
From Germany, he used to start his radio centres and he used to inform the people of India about the freedom movement from these radio centres.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio in a weekly newspaper.
He used to run this radio from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu in all languages.
I have also spent a year talking to you from Akashwani.
Send your information, ideas and proposals.
It also benefits the government.
The reforms are initiated.
Your contribution, your participation is invaluable and invaluable.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you.
The citizens of South India are commemorating the celebrations of Onam and celebrated the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan yesterday.
Keeping in view the issue of social security, the Government of India has launched several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time, everyone has accepted this scheme.
I had requested our sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I am told that 11 crore households have been connected to them since the launch of this scheme and about half of these schemes have been benefitted by the mothers and sisters.
I extend my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, while talking to you, it has been a year that the Jan Dhan Yojana has been taken up in large numbers.
The banking sector is also an important part of the economy and it has been strengthened to reach the house of the poor.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got jobs.
You will be happy to note that in this year, one lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps will be organized to connect banking sector, economy and poor people.
You cannot stop opening accounts only.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facility under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also got that facility.
It is believed that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I would like to congratulate all those who open accounts in the bank and tell the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters that they are in the bank.
This bank is yours, do not leave it anymore.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your job to keep it in mind.
Due to recent incidents in Gujarat, the entire country was unhealthy due to violence and it is bold that if something happens in Gandhiji and Sardar's land then the entire country will be hit first.
However, in a very short span of time, all my swearing-in brothers and sisters in Gujarat brought the situation under control.
The situation did not get worse and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood are on the right path and on the path of development.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to listen to their ideas and tell you the truth, however, you can hear music.
I have come to speak to these scholars in the choice of their words, the method of speaking, the liberality and harmony in the Sufi tradition in which there is a luxury of music.
I was very happy.
Often there is a need to reach the real form of Islam to the world.
The message that the Sufi community has been linked to love and obedience will reach far and wide, which will benefit human society, Islam and I also tell others that we should understand the tradition of Sufi and the tradition of Sufi.
I am fortunate that in the coming days, there will be another opportunity and I will get this invitation.
Buddhist traditional scholars from many countries from all over the world will come to Bodhgaya in India and there will be discussions on the good of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am happy to be invited to visit Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru visited Bodh Gaya.
I am glad that I will get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you about my mind.
I had asked this topic even before from Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in my speech in the Parliament, from the public meetings and from the news of the mind.
Every time I have come to say that the Government of India is open in the matter of the land where the debate is going on.
This means that the situation that was before the formation of my government was re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I want to ensure that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just a declaration for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on August 15, we used to say that not only the agriculture sector but also the agriculture and farm welfare department will be set up.
We are implementing this decision quickly.
The war of 1965 had completed 50 years two days ago and when the subject of the 1965 war came to light, he remembered Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
I salute all those who have won India in the war of 65.
Such incidents in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi community last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with him for an hour to meet the noble scientists from all over the country.
I am happy to learn that India is doing well in the field of science in many directions.
Our scientists are doing well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that this is not only inspiring for me, but also to teach me something new.
And I have seen how many young scientists were talking with enthusiasm and how many dreams were seen in their eyes.
During the past, I used to say that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and there are many opportunities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look at science and our educational institutions should inspire students for it.
It is written about skill development.
Sriman Prakash, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, has stressed on the need for good teachers for primary education.
I have stressed on reforms in education sector.
In particular, I want to tell my young friends one thing.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I used to say that for this job at the lower level, how to do this interview
And when there are letters for childhood then every poor family, the widow, who will get the recommendation, who will get this job with the help of whom
I don't know what words are used
It was perhaps the cause of corruption at the lower level.
I used to say in my 15th August speech that the government has taken a lot of steps in such a short span of time that only 15 days have taken place.
The information is being sent and the decision will not be taken for smaller posts.
It is unfortunate that every year about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die at the time of delivery and immediately after delivery.
This is worrisome and horrible.
In fact, there has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and newborns.
We look out on the telephone but we don't pay attention to it but we don't see it from the newspapers.
It is important to keep small things clean at home along with clean water.
Life is very precious.
It is not right that ignorance of polluted water, satisfaction towards cleanliness is the cause of death.
Dengue tests are done free of cost at around 514 centres across the country.
The time of Raksha Bandhan to Diwali is the time of many festivals in our country.
Let us connect every festival with cleanliness. See this quality of cleanliness will come in your nature.
I often say that we will not get the privilege to sacrifice our lives, but the fate of living for the country is certain.
Two youngsters of our country, two brothers, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward and this is the same.
Sometimes due to lack of understanding, we do injustice to our youth.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we know and learn new things by talking to them.
I met many youngsters who said that I have taken the message of Sande on Cycle.
A day in a week, there is a decisive decree of some such type of cycle-day.
They say that the joy of being healthy, environmentally better and young is going on.
In our country, the number of cycle users increases in many households and many people encourage it.
I am glad to note that these are the best efforts to save the environment, to sustain health and today two youngsters of my country have hoisted the flag of India in the United States.
Today, I congratulate the government of Maharashtra.
The monument will inspire us to work for the deprived, exploited, vulnerable and deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that have honoured Ambedkar.
We can take the country forward by putting it on the shoulder.
My best wishes to all of you, thank you very much.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters to pay Kharif.
I remembered one more thing that pleases my heart and I was also happy.
Pulses and oilseeds have always been dissolved in our country.
The poor people have to face a lot of oil for food and vegetables.
I am happy that the cereals that have been carried out this year have increased by 50 and oilseeds have increased by about 33.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, it has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The relationship with the land of this country is also of the soldiers.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers broke down on hundred enemies.
This war of Kargil was not just a war fought on the border, but every city of India, every village of India participated in it.
For those mothers and sisters whose young boys were fighting against enemies in Bhubaneswar.
The youngsters who had not even dried up the henna from the hand for marriage, they fought against their brave young children, those who felt young again, who had taken the fingers of their fathers, who had not learnt to walk further.
It is because of these sacrifices that India can speak directly to the world today.
We started the MyGov Mission on July 26 in a few months after our government came to power in 2014.
We launched this website to enhance their participation in democracy to connect every citizen with development.
And one year later, I am happy to say that about two crore people visited the MyGov website.
Nearly five and a half lakh citizens have reacted and more than fifty thousand citizens have received information on PMO APPLICATIONS.
Is it right for such people to get rid of the ticket of the train
However, this thing looks smaller, but nobody has thought of this thing that the government has not come to mind.
However, Akhilesh ji's demand was seriously considered by the government and today a separate system has been implemented for ticket reservation for our disabled sisters and sisters.
New logos are created, two lines are formed, programmes are formulated and there are very positive information on MyGov.
It is a feeling that new streams are flowing in the governance system.
One feels a new consciousness.
In my address on August 15, MyGov has begun to introduce information on which issues I have to face.
Sumitra Raghav Chari has suggested a lot from Chennai.
I believe that this is a good idea that the people of the country should suggest issues in my speech on August 15.
I am confident that you will definitely get good information.
I take care of one thing and it reaches you.
I don't want to preach anybody, but I don't aim to reverse the responsibility of the central government, the state government or the local NGOs.
Recently, two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter used to be in a state of injury for about ten minutes.
Hoshkote Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune and Prasanna Kakunj of Murbidri in Karnataka have expressed concern over this issue.
One person dies in road accident every four minutes.
But I urge the parents to get the teachings of all these kids from home and from the family, the parents should take care of them.
In this regard, the government has taken a lot of new policies and initiatives, be it training citizens on road safety, road connectivity or providing immediate assistance to the accident victims.
Keeping this in mind, we are going to demand transport and security bills.
We have the idea of taking several important steps to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Agenda in the coming days.
This scheme is a cashless treatment for roads like Goodgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
It means that we are going to give priority to provide treatment to the victims of accidents by taking care of whether the bill is nearly money or not.
Tool Free Telephone Number 1033 will be available all over the country to indicate the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there is no accident in the original form, because the lives of one or the other are more important.
Sometimes I tell you that the worker should be comfortable.
In the last few days, I thought of talking to you about it.
But how to bring consciousness in the work done by hand
This victory has been shown by Biswal, how to mix our interests and art capabilities with his work.
It is likely to be said about their pictures and I got to know about one more thing.
In Madhya Pradesh, the entire group of government officials in Harda district, a different work started by the Sangh touched my mind.
I liked this thing and we would like to hear that these officers started the Mission Operation Malayudh.
However, this is an important fact that he gave a new turn to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
There is a camp named Kashla near Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village have constructed toilets in an effort.
Now no person in this village goes to the open for toilets and when the construction of toilets is completed then the village of Keshla celebrated the Anandotsav.
These are the best examples of how the values of society change, how the mindset of the people change and how the people of the country are leading the nation on the path of progress.
From Guwahati, Bhavesh Deka has written about questions related to the North-East.
However, the people of the North-Eastern region are active.
They will go to village, talk to the officers of the administration there, people will speak to the representatives and citizens.
The central government will do whatever is possible to solve these problems.
One of the best efforts to go far east from Delhi, what I say is the CT East Policy.
My dear countrymen, the success of Mangal Movement is a matter of pride and joy for all of you.
We know this news but we don't care about it.
I often tell these officers that the IAS officers of the government should go to a school and college nearly two-four hours in the week to interact with the students.
This work is difficult, but it has to be done.
During the examination there is no electricity therefore do not fall in the study of children .
If there is a small business and industry in the village then there will be electricity.
Somewhere, we have to go to another village to charge mobile.
We must do this, we have started it.
Today I thought to talk to you on different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your information and new ideas for August 15, I will definitely be useful.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I feel that something is less.
We were listening to many things in the form of a self-sufficient family of 130 crore Indians, in a very light atmosphere.
Sometimes yourself was inspiring for our people.
You can imagine how this period of holiday has gone.
On Sundays, the last Sundays of the month - 11 o'clock in the morning.
I used to feel that I do something like Miss.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, even though I used to speak alone and that word may be mine, that voice may be mine, but that story is yours, males or yours.
I was just using my words and my words.
There was a feeling of freeness in the mind.
Once we have come to our minds, now the elections have ended, you must talk about four things.
But afterwards, I thought, no.
It is our Sundays programme and it should continue.
However, on Sundays, we had to wait a lot.
Small, simple and light things are also being used to bring about changes in the lives of society.
This is a part of it and this order gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in one sense, it is going to continue to move forward by empowering the consciousness and energy of New India.
In the last few months, there have been many messages in which countless people have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Ahm to Vam.
This peaceful interaction for me was a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in Dhamdhumi of elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will have a curiosity to know the answers of these questions.
I only say that I had a feeling of a little liberty in the minds of the word Mann Ki Baat, and I believe that I must have got the opportunity to fill the furnace in that solitary cave in the valleys of Kedar.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar visits, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I feel constant from your speeches.
The routines that come for Mann Ki Baat, which are getting inputs, are different from the daily government.
Sometimes the letters you have sent were also a reason to inspire me in a way.
Sometimes, some of your words do the work of boosting my thought process.
I am aware of the challenges faced by the nation and society.
People are also telling us what is our answer to these problems.
I can see that people ask their problems in the letters and also write what is the answer to them.
The pairs of questions reveal their answers, some or the other new ideas, direct or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and society.
Today, my mind will be happy.
The last time I had said that now we have met for three-four months, some people had taken the political meaning.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
You must have taken the form of belief.
And that is why I was very easy to say in the last Mann Ki Baat that I would come to speak to you a few months later.
You must have settled here and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we move with this feeling, then the order of Mann Ki Baat will continue as before.
The movements were not limited till the prison.
There was an outrage in the hearts of the people.
The democracies had a kind of stir in their minds.
Whenever you get food from time to time, you don't know what hunger is.
Likewise, somebody shares the importance of democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country used to feel that during the period of introduction, you had slapped something.
Whatever we have never used, even if somebody shook it, they are sorry, they are tortured.
Some of the arrangements have been made in the framework of India and the democracy has remained here.
There is also a need for reduction in social system.
There is also a need for laws and regulations and rights and duties are also discussed.
However, India can proudly say that for us there are more than laws and regulations in the culture of democracy.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage and our tradition.
And with this heritage, we have become a small and big one.
Therefore, the country had not only for us, but for our interests, but also for the protection of democracy.
We have easily accepted the precious democracy that we have received.
In India, more than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
However, if the world's destiny is to be changed then I tell you that if one has left China then more people than any other country's population have lost their right to vote in India.
The number of voters voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The population of the entire Europe is more than the total number of voters in India.
You can imagine how much resources and human strength are required to fulfil this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and workers were able to cross the elections by working day and night.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces took their responsibility to make this great democracies successful.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also laid the foundation stone for their hard work.
You can imagine how much of the total election was being done.
All these polls were made to ensure that a single voter should not be deprived of his voter.
In the remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, it was being built a polling station for a female voter.
You will feel new to know that the EC officials had to travel for two-two days to reach that remote place.
Besides, one thing has happened to honour this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and to every person participating in this election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from me many times that I have been asking for books or books.
We all can give books instead of flowers while welcoming.
On hearing this, people have started visiting books and welcomed them at several places.
I recently visited a summit called Prem Chand's popular Kahania.
I liked this visit.
Continuously, I couldn't get a long time, but during the journey, I got the opportunity to save some of his stories again.
Premchand has portrayed the society in his stories, while reading them, the paintings of those times used to appear before our eyes.
Every description he wrote, everything is alive.
His stories seem to have included the feelings of the whole of India.
While reading the story of Nasha, my mind was following the question of economic inequality in society.
I remembered the time of my youth.
There was talk of our youth overnight on economic inequality in society.
The sensitivity of a child, the immense mothers in his mind, the maturity in his thoughts in such a young age was seen in this story.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid comes out of the fair and comes to our lives, the real sense of human sensitivity reaches a higher height, this story will eventually make the young reader very emotional.
In this story, the survival of the lives of a poor farmer was obtained.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated in the extremely dense forest of Idukki .
The Primary Teacher P.
Murlidharan and a small tea shopkeeper P.
V.
The library was launched by both of them in a tireless manner.
Sometimes both of them used to make books and books used to be booked in their villages in the forests.
Today, this library is working to show a new direction to everyone along with the tribal children here.
Her Gujarat Mission was successful in Gujarat.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and they read books.
In today's digital era, I urge you to keep some time to save books in your daily work.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that not only the people of our country consider the present time but also the challenges of the future.
When I was reading your response to the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remembered that many people have written a lot about water problems.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Setanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water related challenges.
Water is equal to mothers, mothers should be blessed and the grace of mother Jalrupi should be upon us.
Due to the deficiency of water every year there is adverse effect in many parts of the country .
We save only eight percent of the water, so now we need to solve this problem.
Just as we have searched the answers from the public participation and the power of the people, we will find out the answers with the help of all the empowerment and determination of one and a half crore Indians on the water problem.
Keeping this in mind that the importance of water is the highest, now the new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate speedy decision-making of all the issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs and the villagers across the country.
In order to save water, to save water, to keep water storage, not drops of rain and to save the rain water, the village chiefs should speak at the village meetings.
It has been decided to save every drop of water and save the rain water in the villages.
In this Mann Ki Baat programme today, I would like to listen to you a sarpanch.
People there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I extend my best wishes to all the villagers, all the Sarpanchs and the activeness they have shown to save the water.
Several components across the country have made such a resolution of water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of the village are now in the competition to build a water temple in their villages.
I have already told you that if you make a collective effort then there are very good positive results.
There cannot be a single specific formula for reducing water storage across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But all the goals are the same and that is water saving, water conservation.
Work is being done to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will help in supplementing water.
The lives of the people of the village are changing due to the construction of water tanks from Thimaipalli in Telangana.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan have made a big change.
I was aware of the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
Even though the women of Garhwal are working together in a very good manner, they have come to my reading.
I am confident that whenever we all work together and make a strong effort, it is impossible to do so.
When everybody will participate in the work of water conservation, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I have an inspiration for three things to the people of the country.
My first request is that the people of the country should also start a mass movement for water conservation as they gave the Swachhta Mission.
Together, let us resolve to save every drop of water and I am confident that water is an offering given to God.
Earlier, it was said that the touch of Paris was made of gold.
I say that water is a serpent and a new life is created by the touch of water.
In order to save every drop of water a awareness campaign should be started .
Make the society aware and work to connect the society.
I urge all of you to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you has got the opportunity to go to Porbandar at the birthplace of the revered Bapu, then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of the revered Bapu.
Therefore, I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then you must see the storage of water.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to conserve water.
We all can use the Janshaktifor Jalshakti to showcase our information.
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude for another thing.
He informed me through Twitter how the Presidents of many countries of the world have celebrated Yoga Day in our country, the Prime Ministers, and other dignitaries.
On that day, the whole world looked like a happy and happy family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Why don't you want to recognise those who do such a service and satisfy them
The Prime Minister's Award was announced in the year 2019 to promote Yoga and contribute excellently to development.
This is inspiring.
Now the topic of Yoga is going on, but Indians are not in this field.
Bihar Yoga School, Munger were also honored and have been dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey is being started today, new feelings, new feelings, new resolves, new powers, but I will continue to wait for your advice.
Come on, let us continue to meet and speak.
I hear your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes they try to create that feeling.
You must continue to get your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again visit the next month's Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
There is a strong feeling of satisfaction in the minds of the people of the country after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terror attack in Pulwama.
My condolences to the brave soldiers and their families who have been killed.
The feelings of strong condolences in the opposition to this kind of terrorist violence are in the minds of all of you and my mind, the feelings of trusting the minds and humanity of every countrymen are inspired by the minds of the humanitarian communities across the world.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique adventures and parallels.
Where he has shown a wonderful capability to establish peace.
He has worked hard to respond to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how the work was done within a hundred hours.
Ratan Thakur, the martyr of Bhagalpur in Bihar, has shown his courage in such a sad occasion.
We will send our second son to the army to fight the enemies and we will fight ourselves if needed.
The entire country salutes Meenaji's unprecedented adventure of the martyr of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He has also decided to recruit one of his only children in the CRPF.
When this village of Gumla in Jharkhand reached the legacy of the tricolor wrapped in the tricolor, his executed son also said that we will be filled in the army.
The courage shown by these innocent children is today the spirit of every small child in India.
This kind of feeling is visible in the houses and houses of our brave and mighty martyrs.
Our brave command is not an exception that his family is not an exception.
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria or the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is inspiring.
We don't need to see the ancient events in history to know what is the idea of sacrifice.
This is a moving example in front of our eyes.
These are the examples for the bright future of India.
My dear countrymen, we were waiting for the National Soldier Memorial for the last several years.
That is why it is natural for the people of the country to have curiosity and eagerness about it.
Shri Yut Omkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, has expressed happiness that the work of National War Memorial is being completed.
This memorial is a place to conserve the legend of the great brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to make it an inspirational monument in the country.
We decided to set up a National Soldier Memorial and also launched a direct work.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will dedicate this National Soldier Memorial to our armed forces.
The country will make a small effort to compensate your loans.
This new monument has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti, the place where Delhi's heart is called.
I am confident that the holy work will be in the vision of the people of the country to visit this National Soldier Memorial.
The National Soldier Memorial is a symbol of the country's gratitude for those soldiers who sacrificed their lives after independence.
This memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our Amar Sainiks.
The concept of this National Soldier Memorial is based on four central circles, from the birth of a soldier to the death of a soldier.
The light of Amar Chakra is the symbol of the martyrs' immortality.
The defence cycle after this is reflecting security.
There are queues of dense trees in this cycle .
These trees are symbols of the soldiers and are also giving a message to the citizens of the country, each hour is on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Someone will come here with the aim of informing the bravery of these brave soldiers and they will be safeguarded, we will live and develop the country, so we will be able to get the information of the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.
In the development of the country, our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces are not really possible in the words of great and invaluable contributions.
I would like to express my gratitude to all of you for the men and women police personnel who have been working continuously for our security.
I hope that all of you will visit the National Soldier Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
This will inspire others to visit this sacred place and they will also be eager to visit this sacred place.
At that time, when I was reading the reactions from you, I would be able to reflect in the very compassionate reactions of AshishMukhopadhyay ji.
He writes that on March 3, 1900, the British had tortured Birsa Munda.
And the point of view of Yoga is that on March 3, Jamshed ji Tata ji's birth anniversary.
Both of them have come from different family backgrounds, but they have enriched the traditions, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat have been paid homage to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand in a way.
These two great privileges have not only brightened the name of Jharkhand but also of the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for his contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can be named as inspirational personality as guides, then they are Lord Birsa Munda.
When the British slept with Birsa Munda, they were captured by hiding them very squarely.
Did you know why the British had to accept the path of such a rivalry to catch Munda
Because such a big empire was frightened by the British Munda.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of his traditional blessings, used to destroy the British government decorated with guns and cannons.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership, then the collective will power becomes stronger than the power of the enemies towards the front.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only with the British but also for the socio-economic rights of tribals.
He showed everything in our Alpayushi.
The blind life of the deprived and exploited has brought light like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda paid floral tributes at the age of 25.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Bharat Mata have happened in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifices, bravery and sacrifices of these great people have not reached a new generation.
If the personality like Lord Birsa Munda has given us the feeling of existence then the personality like Jamshedji Tata has created large institutions in the country.
He said that for a bright future, India is essential to become a hub of science, technology and industry.
Not only this, he also set up several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshed ji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji visited the ship during their visit to America and discussed various issues.
The foundation stone of Indian Institute of Science was laid by this discussion.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarjibhai Desai, was born on 29 February.
You all are aware that this date comes once in four years.
Morarji Bhai, a simple, peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders in the country.
Morarjibhai Desai's record of presenting the budget most of the Parliament in independent India is also in the name of the Prime Minister.
During that difficult time when the country's democratic crisis came, Morarji Desai led India's skilled leadership.
Morarjibhai Desai used to snatch himself in the movement launched against the infrastructural protection of democracy.
He had to calculate a very big price during his old age.
During that period, the government used to harass them and put them in the tricolor.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when the Janta Party won elections in 1977.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under Section 20 and 21 of the Constitution will not be transgressed even during the period of revival.
This incident was revised by Morarji Bhai in order to repeat the way democracy was killed in 1975.
Once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, there was a lot of enthusiasm for the Padma awards here every year as well.
In such a scenario, we feel that those who work in a selfless manner, and those who work in the bottom of the country should be honoured.
Many are making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways by taking a lot of hard work.
Those people who are working freely in the service of the people, the service of the society and the largest of these nations are working.
He is a real worker and is far away from the world of glimpse of fame, and he does not have any pride in your name or your name.
He believes in work. This message of Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam song is in a way a direct world.
I want to talk to you today about some such people.
They are working to bring rare paintings to a new generation.
I had visited former US President Barack Obama, the Tri of Life made by Abdul Gafur.
Among the standards of Padma awards, Shabbir of Marathwada is known as the servant of Said Gomata.
The way they have offered their lives for the service of Goddess, their work is different.
Even after centuries of age, he has been training Yoga for many people in the world.
Till now, he has made one and a half thousand people a Yoga teacher and Jamuna Tudu, famous by the name of Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done a brave job to handle two timber mafia and skeletons and saved from the desertification of forests in 50 hectares.
Just because of the hard work of Jamunabai ji, the villagers of that area now plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
He has worked towards how women empowerment and farming can benefit.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in our region to become economically self-reliant by connecting themselves with Self Help Groups.
It can be said that this change in the list of award winners is a new image of India which is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, I am going to tell you about the experience that has come to me recently.
Today, wherever I go to the country, I am trying to get the opportunity to talk to some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana PMJAY.
Brothers and sisters, About 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I am aware that this scheme is bringing about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to afford affordable medicines then you must give him information about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations in schools will start now.
The examinations of the tenth and twelfth will start in the next few weeks to be conducted by different testing boards across the country.
My heartfelt congratulations to the parents and all the teachers of all the students who have given tests.
A few days ago, a large programme like Pariksha Pe Church was organised in Delhi.
The programme, Pariksha Pe Church, was specially held on various subjects relating to examinations.
This will help the students to make sure.
All the students, their teachers and parents can see the entire recording of this programme on the YouTube and I extend my best wishes to all the examination fighters for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, discussions are going on about India and it cannot be said about festivals.
This means that the thousands of years old culture and traditions that we have benefited.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I had visited Kashi and I had the opportunity to spend some time with the Divyang brothers and sisters.
And it was a pleasant surprise for me to listen to it.
The way I speak in the Mann Ki Baat, I have shown the same way by copying it.
I am very happy that people listen to the words of Mann Ki Baat and leave it.
I really got very impressed with the strength of that disabled youth.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through the Mann Ki Baat programme is an inflammatory experience for me.
In a way, I interact with millions of families every month through radio.
Many times, while talking to all of you, while reading the letters sent by you or listening to the telephone, I feel that you all have considered me a member of your family.
This is a great pleasure for me.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we are all busy in the slope of the election.
I myself will also be a candidate in this election.
Respecting the strong democratic tradition, the following Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
This means that the month of March, the month of April and the entire month will be three months.
After selecting all your emotions in this period, with a new belief, and with the strength of blessings of all of you, the programme of interacting with you through Mann Ki Baat will be started and many years will continue to tell you Mann Ki Baat.
Once again, I thank you all from my heart.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveswar ji has taught us that Kayakve Kailas is like living in Kailash Dham, the residence of Lord Shiva, while working hard.
His treasure was such a scholar who had wonderful evidence on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He used to live for the entire life to get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
I have often got the privilege of getting the blessings of Goddess Swamiji.
In 2007, for the birth centenary celebrations of Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji, our former President, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for revered Swamiji.
The poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji and the mission of Siddhaganga Monastery in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my respects to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Indian Election Commission.
It is natural for every countrymen to feel proud of the Electoral Commission in view of the massive elections being organised in India on 25th January, which is being organised as National Voters Day.
Every citizen of India who is a registered voter in our country.
The registered voter will get the opportunity to vote and he will not leave any stone unturned to ensure that the voter is voted.
If we hear that even the polling stations are being set up in the higher than 15,000 feet above the sea level in Himachal Pradesh, even on very far-reaching islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Imagine, only for a voter.
It is natural to feel proud of the Election Commission when you hear this.
This is the beauty of our democracy that the EC employees used to go to far-flung areas and arrange for polls in view of a voter.
I appreciate the Election Commission, which is constantly trying to strengthen our democracy.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if they are eligible to vote.
At the same time, it is my duties to vote and the spirit should be refreshed in us.
We have to realize this responsibility.
This should be our tendency, our tendency.
This should be our culture.
I urge the delegates of the country to make people aware that they should register together or vote for people.
I hope that a large number of youth will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, these great lands of India have given birth to many great men and those great men have done some unique and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is multi-purpose.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great men.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated their birth anniversary in a different way.
I am fortunate to inaugurate the museum dedicated to the heroes who have contributed to the freedom struggle of India on the occasion of Netaji's birth anniversary.
We know that many rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort are now in a very beautiful museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army
Yad-e-Jallia and 1857 Atin Fitty Consumption, the Museum dedicated to India's First War of India and the entire campus is dedicated to the nation as the Shanti Mandir.
Every brick in this museum has the aroma of our glorious history.
The residents of the museum inspire us to see the narratives of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
At this very place, British Rajwatin had run on the brave son-in-law of Bharat Mata - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the Red Fort, in the Kranti Temple and the memories related to Netaji, the members of Netaji's family visited me a very special cap cap cap.
Netaji used to wear that hat.
I let that hat be kept in the museum so that the people coming there can see that hat and inspire patriotism from it.
In fact, our patriotic bravery and patriotism have to be transformed into different forms.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition of August 15.
On this occasion, 75 years of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government were completed.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave young man and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Let's go to Delhi, let me eat, let me give you freedom, let me give you a brilliant announcement and Netaji gained place in the minds of every Indian.
And I am glad that we have been able to do this thing for several years.
I remember that day when all the family of Netaji had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
We all shared with us on several issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road related to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Temple.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people, as well as leaders were not very close to radio and they were also elected the same medium to interact with the people of the country.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of starting his address on the radio.
At the outset, he used to say that as soon as he started his address, he used to say that a new zeal, a new energy was being disseminated in the devotees as soon as he heard it.
I am told that these radio stations used to broadcast the news of weeks which were given in many languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Maratha, Punjabi, Pashtu and Urdu.
The resident of Gujarat, M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast by Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been established in this Kranti Temple .
It is an attempt to present Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and artworks of the centuries old.
In the museum, excellent artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I would like to urge you all to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that there is a discussion of art here and I am telling you about the excellent artwork of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, we have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I want to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
They have also drawn pictures of animals and birds, they have also drawn many beautiful natural pictures and they have not only worked to depict many human characters through art.
And the special thing is that he has not given some names to most of his pictures.
He believed that those who see their paintings would understand the meaning of those paintings, and they would know the meaning of their message through paintings.
His paintings have also been showcased in European countries, Russia and America.
I am hopeful that we will definitely visit the Kranti Temple to see their paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given a message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and work.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give a big message from a little bit.
He used to say that if the patriarchs of Haijo Ketan are not combined in caste, if the bananas are thrown down, then the leaves below the leaves, then there is no leaves under the leaves and in the end, but the entire trees come to an end, just like that, the human being has become different species and human beings have not remained.
He used to say that if God is in every person, it is not right to seek him on the basis of caste, religion and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his messages.
It would not be wrong to say that he described the world as a true meaning of labour.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I should brighten Indias space programme and its future related aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take juice in the space programme and take some different ideas and go beyond the sky.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I had the privilege to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists in the country.
We are proud of the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students today.
This is the 24th January that our students have launched the Kalam-Set.
The sounding rockets made by students from University in Odisha have established several records.
As long as the country has become independent and 2014, almost as many space missions have been launched in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of launching 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country is using space technologies in a better way to protect live and wealth.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all these are being helped by space technology.
Our fishermen have been given navigational devices, which are helpful in economic development along with their security.
We are using space technologies to enhance government services distribution and accountability.
Housing for All, about 40 lakh households have been built in about 23 states under this scheme.
At the same time, there are about three and a half crore logistics under the MNREGA.
Our satellites have become a symbol of the growing strength of the country today.
This is the contribution of our excellent relationship with many countries in the world.
South Asia Satellites have been a unique initiative which has also given development to our neighbouring friends.
Through our competitive launch service, India is not only a developing country but also a satellite of developed countries.
The sky and stars are often a big attraction for children .
Our space programme gives a chance to move forward by considering the limits that the children were unable to know.
Our children have a vision to look after the stars and to inspire new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that whoever plays, he will open and there are many young and young players in Khelo India.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 sportspersons in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When the sportsperson will perform the best at the local level, he will perform the best globally.
The sportspersons from every State of Khelo India have done well at their own level.
Many medal winners are inspiring life.
He lives in a parking shade with his family.
The captain of the 21-year-old Mahila Kabdi Union of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvey, will be a resident of Sattar, who was very young and encouraged his brother and his sensitivity.
It is often seen that women do not get any boost in sports like kabaddi.
Nevertheless, Sonalin chose Kabddi and performed excellent performances.
Innovative Show of Asansol, Khelo India is the youngest medal winner in the youngest sports.
Akshata Baswani, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won the Gold Medal in Kamti-Hin Weightlifting.
Their elders are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk about building a India, the pledge of youth power is a New India.
This is not only the contribution of big cities but also the contribution of youngsters, children, young sports talents from small towns, villages and towns in building a New India.
My dear countrymen, we must have heard about several prestigious beauty contents.
Clean beautiful toilets are the names of this future competition.
People are keeping their toilets clean and making some paintings beautiful, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup, the pictures of clean beautiful toilets will also be seen on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and the village chiefs to lead this campaign in their Panchayati.
Definitely put a picture of your clean beautiful toilets on social media with Mylzatghar.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a journey to keep in mind that all of us will be together to free the country from clean and open defecation.
Today, India is moving towards open defecation free, a long time before 2nd October, 2019, to pay homage to the fathers on their 150th birth anniversary.
Ankul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about testing and testing warriors.
Anguul ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
The first part of the year is the time of exams for many festivals.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are engaged in examination related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would have surely liked to discuss this matter in the Mann Ki Baat programme today, but you will be happy to hear that two days later, on January 29, at 11 a.m. the Pariksha Pe Church programme will communicate with the students from all over the country and the parents and teachers will also participate in the event.
And many foreign students will also participate in the event.
Some of these ideas and information will definitely be placed before you in the programmes in Town Hall.
We can also see lives through social media and Namo.
My dear countrymen, January 30 is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
We also pay homage to martyrdom for two minutes.
My best wishes to all of you and thank you very much.
The year 2018 will be over.
And that is why experiences are benefitted and self-confidence is also created.
What can we do, which will transform our lives and contribute to the development of the society and the country.
My best wishes to all of you for 2019.
You all must be decisive to keep any memories of 2018.
It is also important that the year 2018 will be remembered as a country and it will be the strength of our 1.
And we are also honourable to fill the threshold of all of us.
Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, was launched in 2018.
Electricity has reached every section of the country.
The prestigious institutions of the world have acknowledged that India is working fast to eradicate poverty.
The vision of the people of the country is moving towards taking the spread of cleanliness to 95.
The tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort on the 75th Foundation Day of the Azad Hind Government for the first time since independence.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who hosted the country in the threshold of unity, got the highest effigy of unity in the world.
The name of the country was raised in the world.
The highest environmental award of the United Nations was given to the Champion of the Earth country.
Indias efforts to transform solar energy and climate will get a place in the world.
The first meeting of the Global Solar Alliance was held in India.

The defence preparedness of the country has become stronger.
This year, our country has successfully completed the nuclear triangle, that is, now we have become a hub in the three areas of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.
The daughters of the country visited the world through maritime courses and the country's glory was filled with pride.
India's first waterway in Varanasi was inaugurated.
This has led to the launch of revolution in the waterways sector.

India also won the blind Cricket World Creator under 19 years.
This year, India has earned medals in large numbers in Asian Games.
India also performed well in the Para Asian Competition.
If I have been talking about our collective efforts for every Indian then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
All this is possible only by the tireless efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, we have met some ordinary Indians in this December.
On December 19, Dr. Jayendran was born in Chennai.
Doctor Jayendran is known as the cheapest treatment provider for the poor .
People say that he was ready to serve the patients.
On this website of com, I have read a lot of legends about the work that inspires his society.
Likewise, on 25th December, the death of Sulagitinarsamma in Karnataka took place.
He was honoured by Padmashri earlier this year.
There are many people like Jaichandran and Sulagitti Narasma who have dedicated their lives for the welfare of the society.
If we are talking about healthcare, then I would like to urge the doctors of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh about their social efforts.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors from the city provide free treatment to poor patients by organizing camps.
In this camp there is a facility of free treatment of various types of diseases every month by the Heart Lang Critical Care.
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors serving patients with selflessness is really worth seeing .
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people launched Swachhta Mission in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I'm right now the tebetterindia.
I am sure that this will bring more and more people to know about our villains that make changes in society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good works are being done around us in the society.
And all this is happening with the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports in every society is one of the most important.
When games are played then there is energy in the minds of those who see.
We see many things like fame, identity and respect for players.
But sometimes there are many things that are more than the world of sports.
I am going to tell you about the disposal of the daughters of Kashmir and he won the Gold Medal in the uite Competition in Korea.
He is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hanayana and Mehnat and Chikati studied and studied the trading, learned and proved themselves.
I pray to all the countrymen for their bright future.
Many greetings and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, 16-year-old Rajini had a lot of discussions about this girl.
Rajan said that his fathers have sacrificed a lot to reach here and have suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh went to work every morning before Rajini and his feelings were raised.
When Rajan expressed his desire to learn rivalry, his father collected all those things and enhanced his enthusiasm.
Rajini had to use the old gloves to teach the childhood because the economic condition of his family was high.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't swallow up.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni, has become the fastest Asian to migrate to the world.
He used to run around 300 kms of cycle every 159 days.
You imagine 300 kilometers of cycling every day
Its responsibility to run a cycle is really worth watching.
Whether we are inspiring to hear about such achievements or not.
Especially when my young friends listen to such incidents, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the obstacles.
If it is determined, if there is strength in the resolution then all the problems fall on their own.
No problem can become a hurdle .
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be many festivals like the iron of enthusiasm and joy in January, Pongal, Makar Sankrant, Uttaran, Magha Bihu, Maghi.
On the occasion of all these festivals somewhere the color of traditional dances will be seen in the Sonarna country and somewhere in the joy of singing iron will be burnt .
After this the day starts increasing gradually and the season of winters starts .
My best wishes to the farmers of our foodgrains.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the spirit of unity in diversity of our festivals.
We can see how many of our festivals have come together with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, but individuals and harmony are the same.
The best example of our close ties with nature is the calendar based on celebrations.
This is not only the year's celebrations but also the knowledge of the planets and monks.
Through this traditional calendar we get to know how old is our relationship with natural and astronomical events .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the date of the festivals is fixed according to the moon and the sun calendar.
It depends on the calendar which calendars calendars do .
In many parts festivals are also celebrated according to the conditions of the monks.
All these festivals are celebrated in accordance with the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak, Bihu.
Rivers and water conservation have a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is a celebration of worshipping the Sun in rivers and ponds.
On Makar Sankranti also lakhs of people bath in the holy rivers .
Our festivals also teach us social values.
On the one hand, they have a mythological significance and on the other hand, every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the 2019 and wish that the coming festival will give you great pleasure.
My dear countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can be proud of and show the world with pride and one of these things is the Kumbh Mela.
People from abroad come there and join the Kumbh forever.
In the Kumbh fair, the people of faith and devotion are devoted.
At one place, millions of people from abroad have come together.
The tradition of Kumbh is full of our great cultural heritage and blooms.
This year, from January 15, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, which you all are waiting for.
Saints and great men have started reaching Prayagraj from now on for the Kumbh fair .
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the list of magnificent cultural traditions of humanity, which can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the ambassadors of several countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At that time the flags of several countries were hoisted there at the same time.
The Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj is likely to be attended by people from over 150 countries.
With the divineity of Kumbh, India's grandeur will brighten its diversity all over the world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium to discover itself and every person coming here feels different.
This is a very big educational experience especially for the youth.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw there that the preparations for the Kumbh Mela are going on very fast.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh.
This year, the Kumbh Mela is also being emphasized on cleanliness.
If we focus on cleanliness along with cleanliness in the Kumbh organisation then its good message will reach far.
This year, Bhakti Triveni will also be able to pay homage to Akshayvat after the holy bath in Sangam.
This Akshayvat, which is a symbol of the beliefs of the devotees, was locked in a fort for many years, and the feelings could not see it.
However, now the doors of this renewable fort have been opened for all.
I would like to urge you to visit Kumbh whenever you go to Kumbh, you must upload some photographs that showcase different pellets and colors on social media, you will be inspired to visit this Kumbh.
This Kumbh of spirituality should be the Mahakumbh of philosophy in India for Indians.
This Kumbh of art, also become the Mahakumbh of creation powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of all our countrymen about the celebrations of January 26.
There is an unprecedented relationship between revered Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan came from South Africa as Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi launched his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against the discrimination.
He also set up Finics and Tolstoy Farms, from there the voices of peace and justice were raised all over the world.
2018, Nelson Mandela is also being celebrated as the centenary year and is also known as Madiba.
You all are sure that Nelson Mande is considered an ideal in the fight against corruption all over the world.
He had been able to absorb Turangwas for so many years and inspired by respectable Bapu.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirations for the entire world, but also encourages us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit in Kevadia on Narmada coast in Gujarat, where the highest statue of the world is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions on how steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity and in any way the award will be honoured to those who contribute to national unity.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to keep Indias integrity intact.
Sardar Patel used to believe that India's true strength is in the diversity of this place.
Honouring his feelings and paying homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, for a long time in his life, North India was his workplace and he had sacrificed his lives in Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi, North India and the last of life in Nanded.
Thus, in a sense, the whole of India received his blessings.
If we look at their lives then we can see the reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of the father, Shri Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji ji obtained the post of Guru in his nine-year-old childhood.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice as a heritage from Guru.
Their personality was calm and straightforward, but whenever they tried to smile the poor and the weak, whenever they were wronged, Guru Gobind Singh fought a lot for the poor and the weak.
If one and a half lakh boys, sportspersons, then Gobind Singh Nam said that it is not right to demonstrate their strength by fighting against weaknesses.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that this is the biggest service to overcome human sufferings.
He was an excellent tricolor, and he was present on many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country that are not discussed in a wide range.
I mean, the Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority is implementing.
I have been working to promote the safe and healthy habits of food.
India can be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, F. S.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him on this initiative taken by him.
I urge you all to join these initiatives.
I would like to tell you that we should also participate in this and especially the children should show these things.
It is important to get education that tells the importance of food from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of the year 2018 and we will meet again in the year 2019.
Life, be it individual or nation or society, inspiration is the foundation for the progress of that life.
Let us move forward with such inspiration, new enthusiasm, new resolves, new achievements and new heights, let us change ourselves and change our country.
On 3rd October, 2014, on the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, all of you had jointly started a journey.
One person was a dragon.
There was no cloth on the slope.
On the side of the road, he had made a tiny turban.
There was a discussion on the radio at that time.
It should reach the remotest part of the country, from the remote villages to the metro cities, from the farmers to the young businessmen.
Recently, Akashwani has also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the implications received from the survey, some meanings are quite different and careful.
In those people who have conducted this survey, about 70 percent of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has a very big contribution in enhancing positive sentiments in society.
This is a glimpse of the positive sentiments that live in the minds of our countrymen.
Many people have also come to know that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the feeling of doing something by voluntary and voluntary.
There has been a change in the way people are coming forward with great zeal for social service.
I am very happy to see that the popularity of the radio is increasing due to Mann Ki Baat.
However, in this journey only radio has not been the only medium.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
The doubts that we have presented are exactly the same.
And if a leader has been given Myke to speak and millions and millions of people are listening to him then what should be more
What words have been used again and again, he added.
The researchers have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I was sure that there was no political support in it.
I have been inspired by you, but you have done your best to achieve this resolution.
It was evident in every portion of the Mann Ki Baat that what is the expectation of the stories from the online telephones.
What will happen and what will happen to Modi, but this country will remain intact and our culture will remain incomplete.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will continue to live.
Anybody from a far-flung corner of the country tells me that people should not be very much intimidated with small shopkeepers like us, auto-rickshaw drivers and vegetable sellers.
Now a scheme like Selfie with Dr. can be started in a small village in Haryana and can spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government baat.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
If we want to give a direct answer to the question that we have asked, then we don't prepare anything.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Because every time before Mann Ki Baat, I get letters from people.
By calling this number, people also record their message in their voices.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, we are trying to save more and more letters and tappings.
Every minute, my countrymen have been doing home in my mind and that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of the writer and his feelings become a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
It is my voice in Mann Ki Baat but all the examples, emotions and inspirations are of my countrymen.
In Mann Ki Baat, there are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name till now, but these people are not neglected and send their letters.
Efforts are also made to pay attention to all those letters and their suggestions which are not available in Mann Ki Baat.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of Akashwani prepares each part to spread in different languages.
Some people listen to the words of Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in style.
In one way, he becomes Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skills shown by them.
I urge all of you to listen to this programme in our local language too.
However, many of the topics discussed in the Mann Ki Baat were raised by the media.
There are many topics such as cleanliness, road safety, drug-free India, selfie with doctors, media has created new ideas and made it a campaign and worked in that field.
Without our cooperation, the Mann Ki Baat Tea journey was incomplete.
Sometimes our predecessors also stand as a major crisis in interactions.
Besides acceptance and response, I keep giving priority to understand what is the matter.
Normally, there was a discussion on the Communication Gap between the elderly, adults and children of Kumar Age.
In fact, most households are also limited to interacting with young children and children.
In this there were discussions on the study of children or their habits as well as their internal life.
I have always been trying to learn from what they are doing or how they think of these children.
Finally, this is a New India.
Some people believe that the younger generation wants to do a lot of things together.
I say, what's wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and to dream of a tall one, the youngsters have made this change.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vinita ji has written on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat, on 26th November, I should talk about the Constitution Day.
They say that this day is very special because we have accepted the constitution for 69 years and it is going to enter the 70th year.
Imagine that within three years, these great seminars have created such a comprehensive and detailed event.
The way these great people have created such a swift settlement, this is still an excellent example of time management and productivity.
The special thing in our constitution is that the rights and duties have been detailed in detail.
Both of them will take the country forward in the lives of citizens.
If we respect and respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected by ourselves and even if we follow our duties in the constitution then our rights will be protected by itself.
I still remember that when the Republic of India had been 60 years old, in 2010, we had taken a glorious luxury journey keeping an elephant on the elephant in Gujarat.
We have made our efforts to create awareness about the constitution in the youth and to inform them about the important aspects of the constitution.
And I would like to ensure that Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, we can never forget the contribution of the great man at the time when the State Constituent Assembly is discussed.
He was a great man, worshipped Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Majesty Day is on 6th December.
It is not a new thing for India, what is the democracy and how the parliamentary system is.
He said that this freedom that we have received after such a struggle is invaluable and we have to save our blood by the last drop.
India First, Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, you all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and in the next year, we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He has always shown the path of truth, action, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been instructed to celebrate this event on a large scale.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
At that time I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, there was a huge loss to the guruvada.
However, in collaboration with the local people, the way the state government has worked for the restoration of this guruvadhar is still going to be an ideal.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur Corridor so that the tourists of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But our journey will continue.
The more people will be connected to us, our journey will be better and happy to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people, what do I get because of Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary of all of you and like every year, the younger sections of the country are ready to run for unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race competition to listen in large numbers.
About six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, a picture of Sardar Patel was published on the page of the world's famous International Month Time.
It was a map of India that had been divided in many parts.
More than 550 institutions were in the country.
Even though the juice of the British in India had ended, he would have broken this country in many parts and then dissolved the country.
During the month of Time, it was written that there are risks such as destruction of India, violence, non-distribution, inflation and power politics.
Further, it was written in the month of Time that if anyone has the ability to encircle the country in the threshold of unity and injury then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This period of the month of Time was going to open many other aspects of the life of Iron Man.
He gave a direction to the Bardoli Satyagraha, how he arranged for rescue operations after the awards in Ahmedabad in the 1920s.
He made all institutions merger in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajvati of Rajasthan, Sardar Patel's ideological maturity and strategic skills, we can see India together today.
We commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji by seeing this nation built in the bond of unity, our mother India.
On 31st October, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary will be even more special. On that day, we will dedicate the foundation of unity to the nation while paying homage to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is more than double the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in America.
This effigy is the highest effigy of the world .
Every Indian will now feel proud that the highest effigy in the world is on India.
Sardar Patel, whose relationship with the earth, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed on the earth of Kashmir and protected the slope from the horsemen.
This historical incident is directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading a very old child of Sam Manikshaw, the great Indian Army officer.
In that childhood, Field Marshal Manikshaw was reminding him of the time when he was a Colonel.
On 31st October, his former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, is also the death anniversary.
I pay homage to Indira Ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are very important in the world of sports.
The country that has these qualities in the youth will not only progress in the fields of economy, science and technology but will also hoist our flags in sports.
Our Para Athletes, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, got the opportunity to visit.
In this competition, India won 72 medals and won a new record and enhanced India's honor.
I got the privilege of meeting all these talented Para Athletes personally and I congratulated them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
We are happy to note that our youngsters have done the best in the Youth Olympics 2018.
In this competition, we have won three more medals in mix types besides 13 medals.
You must have remembered that India's achievements in the Asian Games have also been better.
Look, for a few minutes, how many times I used the words of the best, the most glorious.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is reaching new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in such areas which have never been considered.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur and he won Gold in Athletics for the country at the Asian Para Games 2018.
They are disabled from birth.
When he was eight years old, he had a eldest legend.
After eight years, he was brought to an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanage, he worked as a water in the drains on the roads of Delhi to clean the DTC bus while driving a life train.
Today, he has won gold medals for India in the International Games.
Moreover, look at Indias excellent performance in sports, India has never won any Olympic medal in Judo.
However, Tababi Devi won history by winning Judot Silver Medal in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young player Tababi Devi will live in a village in Manipur.
They have a big labourer and mother works for selling fish.
Many times his family had such a time that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not been lost.
And he won the medal for the country and made history.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young player and his responsibility is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA-17 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world had lauded him for taking a very successful sportsperson.
A new record was created in the number of visitors in the FIFA under Seventeen World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people have enjoyed football engagements in different stadiums in the country and have enhanced the enthusiasm of young players.
This year, India is fortunate to organise Men's Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup 2018 will start in November, 2018 and run till December 16.
Every Indian is playing a game or playing a game, he has a spirituality towards Hockey.
India's history in Hockey has been written with gold.
Earlier, India had won gold medals in many competitions and once India has also been a world crude winner.
India has also given Hockey many great players.
When Hockey will be discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without these great players of India.
Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji and the whole world knows him.
After that, Balvinder Singh Siniyar, Leslie Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh and Dhanraj Pillai have travelled a lot from Hockey.
Even today, team India players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey with their hard work and dedication.
For sports lovers there is a good opportunity to see a thrilling face .
He should visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other unions.
During this along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and many world famous sightseeing and sacred places along with Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey Association for this competition and I assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians stand with them and for support.
I extend my best wishes to all the unions of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are serving themselves for social work, it is inspiring and enthusiastic to all the countrymen.
But in the new era, new generations, new hopes, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward to work.
A few days ago, I had visited a programme where a portal has been started, the name of the Self-for-Sociality, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country have started this portal to encourage our workers to provide them such opportunities for social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud to see the enthusiasm and spirituality they have for this work.
IT to society, we are not, we are not yes, we are not adults, we are smelling the journey of Samasti.
Somebody is teaching children, somebody is teaching the senior citizens, somebody is engaged in the work of cleanliness, somebody helps the farmers and there is no desire to do all this but the spirit of dedication and determination.
A young man himself learned Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball Association of the Disabilities.
This is the spirit of dedication and dedication that has been launched for a specific work.
Wouldn't any Indian be proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was watching people's information for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a charming text of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov, Please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the customs and traditions of many communities of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
How to develop sustainable development we need to accept their traditions in our lives and teach them something.
Manish ji, I compliment you for pursuing this topic of Mann Ki Baat.
It is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious history and culture, today, the entire world, especially the western countries, are discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for balanced lifestyle.
Though our India is not free from this problem, but to overcome this, we have to take our insights, we have to see our rich history, traditions and especially the lives of our tribal communities.
Continuing a collaborative agreement with nature has been part of our tribal culture.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
People of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship trees like Pipal and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, the world community has shown us the path of environmental protection.
In particular, it is permissible to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees, but they don't believe that any tree should be damaged.
In Arunachal Pradesh, Mishmi claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They also consider them brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland tigers are seen as the protector of forests .
The Varali community of Maharashtra considers the tiger as a guest and for them the existence of the tigers is prosperous.
It is a belief in the people of Central India that their fate is connected to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to be hungry.
In the reproductive season of the Gonda tribal fish of Central India , the Kethan stops fishing in some parts of the river .
In southern India on the Nilagiri plains a small battalion community is broken , their settlements are made of locally available objects .
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal communities are very peaceful and combined, but if someone harms their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
Our first freedom fighters were among the tribal communities, no wonder.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who strongly fought against the British government to protect his wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and institutions who have done some unique work for the society.
This kind of work seems to be irregular, but in fact, it has a lot of impact in changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I used to read about the farmers of Punjab, brother Gurbachan Singh.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to Gurbachan Singh ji's son.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are going to marry the bride's mother and sister in a simple manner.
There is no need to spend much more on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have one.
Nowadays, when the issue of marriages comes, it seems to be that some big demand will be made in front of the bride's households.
But you will be surprised to know that this was Bhai Gurbachan Singh, a simple farmer, what he said was the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said that we will never burn in our fields.
You can imagine how much social power is there.
However, we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform into individual affairs into social interests.
The family of Shriman Gurbachan Singh ji has placed a similar example before us.
I have lived in another village Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
It is a matter of discussion that instead of burning cereals, they melt into soil and the technologies that have to be used for it.
Congratulations to brother Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to all those who are making our best efforts to keep the environment clean and the people of Kallar Majra.
You are leading the Indian tradition of strong lifestyle as a true heritage.
The smaller activity and awareness and positive activity play a very big role in creating a positive environment as the drop-drop becomes the ocean.
My dear countrymen, our texts say: "Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Brahmo Peace: Peace: Brahmo Peace: Peace: Brahmo Peace: Brahmo Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace: Peace in all three people is in the world, in the earth, in the sky, in the sky, in the air, in the air.
In life, in my heart, in you, in every corner of the world, peace is established everywhere.
Peace: Whenever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be seen glittering in golden signatures.
It has a special significance for India on November 11, as 100 years ago, the first war ended on November 11.
The 100th year is being completed, that is, a century will be fulfilled by the massive destruction and the loss of humans in that period.
The first war for India was an important event.
In fact, we did not have to give anything directly to that war.
However, our soldiers fought with braveness and played a very big role and gave the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not less than anybody.
Our soldiers have shown bravery in the remote areas and in the opposite situation.
The only objective was to reestablish peace.
In the first war, the world saw all the ruins.
According to the estimate, about one crore soldiers and citizens lost their lives.
This has led to the importance of peace all over the world.
In the last 100 years, the description of peace has changed.
Today, the meaning of peace and harmony is not just a war.
There is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination from terrorism to climate change, economic development to social justice.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern India has something different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unparalleled and the people here are extremely talented .
Our North-East India is recognized for the best.
North-East India is a region that has made immense progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The award is given by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) associated with the United Nations.
You will be happy to note that this award for making the best policy is with Oscar in that area.
Moreover, I compliment the people of Sikkim for taking this award by pursuing the 51 nominees of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October has ended.
There is a feeling of a big change in the weather.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for this festival.
I urge you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of social interest.
This festival is an opportunity to take new decisions.
It was decided to move forward in a mission mode and become an opportunity for our lives to make a strong resolve.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more your progress will be the progress of the country.
