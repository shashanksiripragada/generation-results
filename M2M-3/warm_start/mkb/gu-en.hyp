Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the sacred festival of Deepawali.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
In this verse, the light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which dedicates the opposite intellect and shows goodwill.
To remember my gratitude to such Divya Jyoti, it may be better for us to spread lights, to spread positiveity and to eradicate the feeling of enemies.
Today Deepawali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that this does not only include the Indian community but now the festival of Deepawali is celebrated with full fervour to the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations there.
In a way, India emerges there.
Friends, Festival tourism also has its own attraction in the world.
Festival tourism also has immense potential in our country's festivals.
Our efforts should be to spread such festivals, be it Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and incorporate the people of other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
We have many different festivals of each state in its own way that people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in Gai Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that this Deepawali will do something different.
I said, Come, let us commemorate this Deepawali, celebrate India's women's strength and their achievements, that is, India's Lakshmi.
And, in view, thereafter, there were innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
It is written on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
My mother took the responsibility of our five daughters since my father was deserted in the 10th century.
Today, we are among the five brothers in good business.
My mother is God for me.
It is universal for me and that is the true meaning of India's Lakshmi.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swami, who is active on the Twitter, says, "Major Sukhbu Kanwar is India's Lakshmi, who is just the daughter of the conductor.
India's Lakshmi is his daughter for poetry Trivari.
He is proud that his daughter works beautifully.
He has received a very good criteria in the examination of CLAT.
Medha Jain ji has also written that a two-year-old woman has been providing free water to travellers at Gualior railway station for years.
Megaji has been very inspired by the humility and compassion of this Lakshmi of India.
People have made many stories like this.
If you must read, get inspiration and yourself have such an inspirational story around you.
I also salute all these Lakshmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 1st century itself.
How beautiful words, how good it is and how good it is in this poem of Kannada language.
Penninda Permegondanu Himavatnu, Penninda Bhrigu Perchidanupenupaninda Jankarayun Jasvadenu Arthat, Himvant, that is, the king of Parvati, Bhrigu sage, because of his daughter Parvati and King Janke because of his daughter-in-law Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and because of the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and its bright future.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day that the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak ji is not only in India but in the whole world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to Vancouver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji that I can tell you, but for that there should be a lot of money from Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered his message to a far-flung world.
He was one of the most travellers in his time.
And wherever he went, he spent his heart with his simplicity, humility and simplicity.
With the message of goodwill and equality, he visited the north or south, east or west, everywhere, the saints and sages met.
It is believed that the well-known saint Shankar Dev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
A sacred place in Kashi is Gurubagh Gurudwara .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was staying there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Devji had travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During the journey of Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had brought solutions to the water problems there.
There is a famous place of Gurunak Jira Saheb in Bidar, which reminds us of Gurunak Devji.
During a grief, Guru Nanak Devji had also travelled to Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
This led to a deeper relationship between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him a guru.
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had traveled.
He found a place in the hearts of millions of people who have followed his teachings with full faith and are doing it even today.
Just a few days ago, the messengers of about 85 countries had gone to Amritsar from Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this was celebrated on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, many angels had illustrated it on the social media and described it with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that on October 31, you all will definitely remember.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron male of India, who was the greatest instrument of unity in the country.
While Sardar Patel had a wonderful capacity to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to interact with those who had ideological disagreements.
He was a true man of Details.
At the same time, he was also expert in the organization's skills.
He was entitled to plans and communications.
Whenever you read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, you know how strong his organisation was.
Thousands of representatives from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
And ensured that nobody had to suffer from water.
Not only this, he was aware of the fact that no representative's commodity or footprints should be squandered in the session and you would be surprised to know that Sardar Patel did it.
He interacted with farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags.
On the other hand, the sale of fertilizers has also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big role and historic work to unite the holidays.
Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty was that whose eyes were on every event.
On one hand, his attention was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on Dursudur Lakshadweep.
It is true that when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country is also discussed in some special provinces.
Immediately after the partition of India in 14th, our neighbour's eyes were on Lakshadweep and he carried the ship with his flag.
Just like Sardar Patel knew that he immediately started a rigorous activity without spending time.
The Tricolor was hoisted immediately after his instructions and destroyed every aspect of the neighborhood to capture the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the Muslim brothers that they should individually ensure that necessary help is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to the progress of India.
It is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you all will also visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the day of 31st October 2018 that was dedicated to the nation and the world, in the memory of Sardar Saheb.
This is the highest statue of the world.
The Statue of Liberty located in America is twice the height.
The world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian is higher than ever.
You will be happy to know that more than 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that every day about eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a subject for the tourism industry for all the states, for the country.
We all witness how a place develops as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
People from abroad come there.
Traffic, accommodation, guide, environment friendly arrangements are developing in itself.
The large economy is developing and people are providing facilities as per the needs of tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, There will be no pride in the fact that in the past, Time Magazine has also given the status of unity to 100 important tourist destinations in the world.
I hope that you all will take some time from your precious time and visit the Statue of Unity.
This is my inspiration.
Friends, You know that since 2014, the National Integration Day is celebrated every year on 31st October.
This day gives us a message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country.
Ekta Run for Unity is also being organised every time as on October 31.
It will include every section of society and every section of the society.
And nowadays, people are seeing a grief and generosity for marathons.
Run for unity is also such a unique feat.
Running is beneficial for all of them mind, mind and body.
There is a feeling of fit India by running here.
And at the same time, we are also connected with the purpose of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but the mind and culture are connected to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
And that is why you can connect yourself in any city where you live.
I hope that you all will run on October 31, for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country to the bottom of unity.
This mantra of unity has become a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage at every stage at every level.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and harmony of the country.
If we want to be around us, there will be some examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony.
But many times it also happens that the efforts of the society are lost very soon from the memorial.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court had heard his payments on Ramjanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days, how was there.
How a group of self-helps were playing games to take advantage of this situation in their own way.
What kind of language was being spoken to create heat in the atmosphere.
In different voices, efforts were also being made to fulfil the expectations.
Efforts were made to reduce the distress from the environment.
We must always remember that we have a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of the sound of unity that can give strength to the country.
Today, I pay homage to them too.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things, so I think that I have heard you too.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield or the temperature goes from zero to 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen is also named only in the air.
It is not less than any parameter to have such challenges in the opposite world.
It is not only protecting the borders of the country by extracting our brave goals in such a vicious environment but also running a clean Siachen campaign.
I appreciate the people of the country for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to cry.
In such a situation, it is very important to discriminate and manage waste.
We all know that Siachen is a snow covered area which is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the mission of Swachhta is to ensure clean water for the people living in the disadvantaged areas and they also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok.
My dear countrymen, the festival is a festival of awakening a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And especially in Deepawali, something or the other has to be brought from the market and it has to be made at least in every family.
I once said that we wish to buy only local things.
There is no need to go to Taluka if we get our requirements from our villages.
There is no need to go to the district if it is available in the talaq.
We will try to buy more local things.
Gandhi will become a great opportunity for the centenary.
And I have been urging that we should buy some of our merchants, brothers and sisters, some of our merchandise made in the hands of our merchants.
Even this Deepawali had bought a lot before Deepawali.
But there will be a lot of people who would have thought that if I go after Diwali then perhaps it will be a little cheaper.
There will be many people who will still be shopping.
So, along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come forward to buy local things.
You see, how important we can also play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali, I extend my best wishes to you all.
In Deepawali, we burst species of species.
But somebody gets hurt by carelessness.
There are some wounds.
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately there will be an Indian who is not proud of our armed forces and our soldiers.
Every Indian, whether it is any field, caste, religion, religion or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the vision of proxy war under the guise of treason on our nation.
Our Armed Forces have organised exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation, know what our strengths are, how capable we and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by keeping their lives in danger.
The day of Parakram Parv recalls the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces to the youth.
And inspire us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan and now it has been decided that our soldiers will respond to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but it is not at all at the cost of the sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice towards peace and when we had no connection with the war.
Our eyes were never on any other earth.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on September 23, we recalled our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur lensors who had liberated Haifa from the attackers.
It was also a parameter made by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the most soldiers in the different peacekeeping armies of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
During the Republic Day celebrations, people are one of the very eagerly waiting part of the parade, in which our Air Force demonstrates its strength with strange cars.
On October 8, we celebrate Air Force Day.
Our Air Force has joined the 21st century's most brave and powerful Air Force, moving ahead from a small beginning with 6 pilots and 1 Air Force in 132.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all Air Warriors and their families who have served for the country.
In 1944, when Pakistani attackers launched an unprecedented attack, the Air Force was at the time that ensured that the Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield in time to protect Srinagar from the attacks.
The Air Force also responded to the enemies in 1965.
Who doesn't know the war of independence of Bangladesh in 11th
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from the occupation of bribery in 1991.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dustbined them by bombing night and day at the places of enemies.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful to our air warriors for their commendable work.
Tofan, Wazod, from the flood to the jungle, their morale has been amazing to face natural calamities and help the people of the country.
The Air Force has set examples in ensuring the equality of gender equity in the country, and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is also giving women the option of surveillance commission, which I had announced from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that in the armed forces of India, not only male power, but also women's strength are becoming equally contributing.
Women are empowered, but now they are becoming empowered.
My dear countrymen, Abhilash Tommy, an officer of the Navy, was fighting his life and death.
The entire country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You are aware that Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was an Indian before traveling to the world with a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he was moving forward in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but had made the terrible maritime storm difficult for them, but the brave Indian Navy continued to live in the midst of the ocean for many days.
I had already met Tommy.
Even after coming out of such a crisis, the courage that he had, was strong and once again the commitment to do something like this is an inspiration for the youth of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and their courage, their valour, their determination, their ability to live and win will surely inspire the youth of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child is aware of the importance of October 2 for our nation.
October 2 this year has a special significance.
Today, for two years, we are going to make several programmes worldwide on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or a great subject like Nelson Mandela, everyone got strength from Gandhiji's ideas and he could fight a long battle to give equality and respect to his people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I urge you to discuss another important work of revered Bapu, which the countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
He then prepared a revised copy of the ideas when the freedom struggle took place in 1945.
The revered Bapu has conveyed his views to the people of the country on several issues such as the protection of the rights of farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Pujaya Bapu was a public collector.
It was the specialty of Bapu to connect people with them and to connect them with them.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every person feel that it is the most important and constant for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
Every section of society, every section of the society dedicated itself on the auspicious occasion of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle.
Bapu had given us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhiji's Talisman.
In this, Gandhiji said, I give you a gentleman, whenever you are in doubt that you start riding on you, remember the face of the poorest and weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how useful will the steps you are thinking to take
Will it benefit from it
Can he control his own life and fate
That is, will it enable the millions of people who are hungry and the soul is unhappy
Then you will see that your doubts are getting cured and it is ending here.
My dear countrymen, a world of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country, its growing economic power, the growing purchase power, can we remember the revered Bapu for a moment if we are going to buy anything
Can you remember that gentleman of revered Bapu
What will be fortunate that will benefit from your purchase directly or indirectly
And if the poor will benefit the poor then my happiness will be more than that.
Whenever we buy something in the coming days, whenever we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must think that every shopping of our countrymen should be required and those who have sweated in it, those who have imposed their money, those who have dedicated their talent should have some benefits.
This is the birthplace of Gandhi, this is the message of Gandhi and I am confident that the poorest and weakest person can bring a small step in his life.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if he cleanses, he would get freedom then he might not know how he would be.
Similarly, today we can also feel that this small work can also be my role in empowering my country's economic progress, economic empowerment and empowering the poor to fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
For example, if you think of buying manufacturing and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many youngsters.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri ji also kept the old or broken clothes of Khadi because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these khadi clothes are made of very hard work - one part of it should be used.
This feeling of affection for the country and love for the people of the country was in the rage of the great man.
Two days later, along with revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
As soon as Shastri ji's name comes, we feel the feeling of immense faith in the minds of Indians.
His compassionate personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was that he looked very humble from outside but he was determined as a mountain from inside.
His picture of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is the identity of his unique personality.
It was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that in his short term of one and a half years, he had given mantras to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the height of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are remembering the revered Bapu, it is very natural that you cannot stay without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhata Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people have joined this campaign and I also got the privilege that I will donate sanitation work with the children in Ambedakar School, Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb.
People from all sections of the country were associated with this labour on 15th.
Institutions have also contributed a lot in it.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS (NSS), youth organizations, media groups, corporate world, all have made a big contribution to cleanliness.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers for this.
Let's hear a phone call-namaskar
It is a matter of great pride that cleanliness has its own significance in everybodys lives and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, you are making toilets in your houses and now you are facilitating this.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign would not have imagined that you cannot see because of being an expert but if you do not have toilets then you will have to live with so many difficulties and after becoming a toilet, it has become a big boon for you.
Perhaps you wouldn't have phoned to talk about this aspect. Perhaps this sensitivity would not have come in the minds of the people associated with this campaign of cleanliness.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, 'Swachh Bharat Mission' has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world.
This time, India is organizing the worlds largest Swachhata Sammelan in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, and experts from all over the world are simultaneously telling their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded with the launch of Bapus 150th birth anniversary celebrations on 2nd October, 2018.
It is particularly essential to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of exploited, afflicted and deprived.
Dr.
The Constitution conferred by Babasaheb Ambedkar has provided several provisions to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on October 12, 13.
A few days later, NHRC is going to complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to increase human dignity.
Our fascinating leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji clearly said that human rights are not a paramount concept for us.
The signs of our National Human Rights Commission include the ideal signs of Vedic times.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
During this 25-year journey, he has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very optimistic event.
Today, as well as the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and bring it into practice - that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the month of October or the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan or the birth centenary of Rajamata Vijayaraj Ji, all these great men have been inspiring us and we salute Sardar Saheb. And on 31st October, I will talk in detail in Mann Ki Baat, but today I want to mention that for some years on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on 31st October, every small city of India, every village and village of India.
This year too, we will work hard to organise 'Run for Unity' in our village, city and city.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to bind every section of the society and every section of the country through the Run for Unity on October 31 and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a big example of social harmony.
There are many stories in the history of the country in which a sheep had linked two different kingdoms or people belonging to religion to faith.
Just a few days later, Janmashtami is also being celebrated.
The entire atmosphere will echo with elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanayya Lal ki and Govinda's birth anniversary.
The comfort of blooming in the color of Lord Krishna is somewhat different .
Best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My warm greetings on the occasion of Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to the daughter Chinmayi who raised this issue.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the occasion of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in protecting, nurturing and delivering this great heritage to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And all of us are also proud of the fact that Sanskrit language has played a very important role in spreading knowledge from the time of Vedas.
The store of knowledge connected to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for interaction.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which innumerable words are possible.
2000 metals, 200 each, i. e. suffix, 22 pages, i. e.
And that's why a minute spirit or a subject can be expressed at all.
That is, if a guru gives a knowledge of a letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or money in the entire earth that the disciple can bring out the credit of his guru.
We all celebrate the coming Teachers Day with this spirit. Knowledge and Guru are invaluable, invaluable and invaluable.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
I also thank you for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this monsoon brings new hopes for our farmers who work hard.
Monsoon relieves dry trees and dry reservoirs in strong heat.
But sometimes it brings immense and destructive floods.
The situation of nature has emerged that some places have rained more than other places.
Now we all have seen that there has been a lot of impact on the lives of the people in Kerala.
Today, the entire country has emerged with Kerala in this difficult process.
Our compassion is with those families.
I am confident that with the courage and courage of the people of the state, Kerala will be sitting very soon.
But at the time of disasters, we also see humanity.
Whether it is Kerala or any other district or region of India, it is working from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to every one of its own place for resumption of life.
People from all age groups and all those associated with every field are contributing to their contribution.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are drying up the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
He did not leave any stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood.
Whether it is airways or ships or landlord or BSF, CISF or RAF, everyone has played a very big role in rescue and relief operations.
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NDRFs brave soldiers.
The topic that people from all over the country have written is Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, our beloved.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Akhil Pandey from Katihar, Bihar, many people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov and urged me to talk about the different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th August, the news of Atal ji's demise like the country and the world was shocked.
A nation leader who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone far from active politics.
The kind of affection, reverence and grief that has emerged all over the country for Atal ji demonstrates his vast personality.
For the past several days, Atal ji's best aspect has come in front of the country.
India will always be the credit of Atal ji for the 1st Amendment Act, 2003.
This transformation has led to two important changes in the politics of India.
First, the length of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the full legislation meetings.
Secondly, the limits fixed under the anti-party law were increased from one third to two-thirds.
With this, clear guidelines have also been set for declaring party parties disqualified.
For many years, the political culture of making the largest cabinets in India was built not for the sharing of work but for enjoying the political leaders.
Atal ji changed this culture.
Their steps saved money and resources.
With this, efficiency also increased.
Atal ji was a long vision that changed the situation and brought about a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from five o'clock in the evening to 11.
Thus, he brought our lifelong Tricolor closer to the people.
I would certainly say that for healthy democracy, for better democracy, for better traditions, for strengthening democracy, for continuous efforts to strengthen democracy, for open discussions, Atal ji will also be considered as an excellent tribute.
Just a few days ago, the monsoon session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 4.
And that is why the Lok Sabha passed 21 legislative legislations and 14 legislative legislations in this session.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and the welfare of the youth.
Several important legislative legislations that benefit the youth and the backward classes have been passed in this session.
You all are aware that for centuries, there was a demand for the formation of the Other Backward Classes- OBC Commission like Scheduled Tribes.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the commitment to make the OBC Commission this time.
Amendment Bill has also been passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
In collaboration, he will prevent the culprits from doing atrocities against these sections and inspire faith in the vulnerable communities.
No member of society can tolerate any injustice against the women's strength of the country.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Amendment Bill and has enjoined strict punishment for such offenders. The culprits of the evil will be punished for at least 10 years.
While those who blame children below 12 years of age will be punished with Fancy.
Just a few days ago, it would have been read in the newspapers that in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, a court has completed the hearing in just two months and has been punishing two of the culprits of the crime on one hand.
Earlier, a court in the Katni of Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits after just five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have given such a quick payment.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing cases of crime against women and children.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
This time in the fourth session, everyone has shown an ideal together.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of the millions of countrymen is attached to the Asian Games being played in awareness.
Every day, people wake up in the morning, first in newspapers, TVs, news, social media and see that an Indian player has won the medal.
Asian games are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons whose competitions are still remaining.
The players of India, especially in sympathy, are showing excellence, but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such sports, in which we have not been so good before, as in sports like Wushu and boating.
This is not just a medal, but a reward for Indian sportspersons and sportspersons' zeal and dreams.
Our daughters are in the growing number of medal winners for the country, which is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the medal winners, we are also youngsters in the age group of 15-16.
This is also a very good indication that most of the sportspersons who have won the medals live in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and also to the great player of Hockey, Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play sports and take care of their fitness because healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then only a bright future of India will be created.
Namaste Bhavnaji, I respect your feelings.
But can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a large mountain which was a whole rock was given the form of an excellent large and wonderful temple, perhaps it was difficult to imagine.
And that temple is the Kailasnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra. If someone tells you that about a thousand years ago a pillar of granite has been built and a rock of about 80 tonnes of granite weight was placed on its top.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is a place where this unbelievable mixture of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan, Gujarat.
India's Bhumi Engineering Laboratory has been there.
There were many engineers in India who made Akalpanya visionary and presented miracles in the world of engineering.
We also found a stone in our heritage of great engineers whose work is still being done by the people.
M.
He is not only worshipped in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and self-respect.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
On his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world.
When I am talking about the miracles in the engineering world, I remember a terrible earthquake in Kutch in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother more than 100 years old.
They were joking at me and were saying that this is my house.
It is called Bhungo in Kutch.
After that, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you will not be able to see any damage.
This house was built by our ancestors according to the natural condition here.
And he was proudly saying that I came to the idea that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created a local situation, which led to the safety of the common man.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
In the changing age we have to learn some new things .
You have to learn
Will you have to join
What should be taught to students
How to make ero west our priority
We must think of many such things when we celebrate the Engineers' Day.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And the preparations for Deepavali also start.
I extend my best wishes to all with this spirit.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, in some places people are still waiting for rains.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the appearance of rains.
But what do we blame the rain
It is human beings who chose the path of conflict with nature and as a result of this nature has been angry at us sometimes.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it .
But on that day Kismat was somewhat different.
When he went far inside the cave, suddenly due to heavy rains, good water was accumulated near the entrance of the cave.
Their way to get out has stopped.
Due to lack of roads, all of them stopped on a small hill inside the cave.
And that's not one or two days, for 18 days.
On one hand, he was facing the crisis.
On the other hand, humanity all over the world was demonstrating the human qualities that God has left.
People from all over the world were praying to expel these children safely.
The feeling of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government or the parents of these children, their family members, the media, the citizens of the country, everybody has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was associated with their campaign by becoming a team.
I believe that the concerted behavior of everyone is a subject of learning, it is like understanding.
It is not that parents are not sad, it is not that the eyes of mothers are not able to come out, but it is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity is a wealth, it is a wonderful thing.
A few days ago, our country's favourite poet Neeraj ji had blamed us.
We can also give a lot of strength to the Indians and inspire them.
Our school board gave us the time of exams and talked about the stress and criteria of the examination.
As such, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youth.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school and enter the college.
If we go to tests, papers and norths in February and March, then enjoyment in holidays in April and May and results are spent in setting forward paths in life, selecting jobs etc.
The attention of the students is limited to the school.
Students come under the rooftop of the professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, leaving the village, getting out of a protective environment has to become a partner.
All such youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and put their lives in a new dice.
I would like to tell you all that, calm down, follow life, enjoy a lot of interaction in life.
Learn some new languages such as new skills, new languages.
He has already succeeded in the MBBS test of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father nurtures the waste of his family.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come out of the poor families and despite the opposite links, they have done something that inspires us to do with their hard work and relationship.
Be it the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who had studied himself sitting under the streetlight on footpath.
Or else, the Divyang daughter Anushka Panda of Gurgaon is suffering from a hereditary disease called spinal cord disease, spinal cord muscular trophy since birth.
All of them have achieved the success of the entire world by possessing every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us, we will also find some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
And when I am telling you the story of these youngsters, I recall the words of poet Neeraj ji and this is the objective of life.
There was something like this that once I was interacting with two Indian youths in San Jose city of America, known as the technological hub.
I appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and take time and do something.
I urged them to convert brain drain into brain gene.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Ranjnish Vajpayee ji, took this challenge and made an innovative effort.
Yogesh ji and Ranjnish ji have jointly developed a smart village app using their professional skills.
This app is not just connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information on their mobile.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Telugu Development Officer and all of them were aware of the use of this app.
It has become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development that is going on in the village.
The App consists of village phone directory, news department, list of issues, health centres and accommodation centres.
The grammar features of the app, the faculty rate between the farmers, works as a market for their products in a way.
If you look at this incident in a minute manner, one thing will be taken into account that the lives of those people in the United States have lived in the midst of information and information, many years ago, the youngsters who have left India are also aware of the nuances of their village, understand the challenges and are connected to the village.
Because of this, perhaps they could make the village a better thing accordingly.
The feelings of their village, their roots, their roots and their deeds are naturally lying within every Indian.
But sometimes due to some distance, some situations, a thin dust gets accumulated on it, but if such a small trauma is touched by them then good things emerge again.
Pandharpur Wari is indeed a wonderful journey.
Friends, Ashadi Ekadashi, which was celebrated this time on 23rd July, is celebrated as a grand commemoration of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi, the pilgrims of Varkari i. e.
This journey, which is called Vari, is connected to lakhs of virgins.
The gathering, keeping the footsteps of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram in Palkhi.
Tirthankaras Lord Vithal or those who are also called Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
There is a different experience of visiting the Vithoba Temple in Pandharpur and its grandeur, its beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the sages of Mann Ki Baat to feel that once you get the opportunity, you must feel Pandharpur.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still teaching the people of Adan in Maharashtra.
They are empowering them to fight against blindness.
Whether it is their burden or disabled, we get a message of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
There is a mantra that can fight against blindness.
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokens and glasses and ensured that the old privacy gets eradicated from our society and the culture of compassion, equality and teaching among the people, our India is enhanced.
We pay homage to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Democratic Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
They have the power and intelligence to show the British rulers their illusions.
The British were so scared of democracies that they had urged them to impose treason three times in 20 years and this is not a small thing.
Today, I want to stand before the people of the country in a interesting event attached to his statue in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, perhaps more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad before 100 years.
During this journey, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed by Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 120, he decided that he would make a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 12.
And I am listening to this time of the British.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival started due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective instrument of traditional devotion and encouraging as well as social awareness, community, equality and equality among the people.
It was such a time when the country was a sermon for the fight against the British, these festivals worked to embrace everyone by breaking the tribes and sects.
The popularity of these events has increased over time.
This shows how this is the crease of our youth towards our ancient heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities it is like this that you can see Ganesh Mandal in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also urged you to celebrate Ganesh Festival with a lot of strength, but I would like to urge you to celebrate Eco-Friendly Ganesh Festival.
And I will even say that the items of Eco-Friendly Ganesh Festival are also placed on My Goa and on the Narendra Modi App for widespread publicity.
I will certainly deliver your words to the people.
Democratic Tilak gained confidence in the countrymen and he suggested that Swaraj is our birth rights and we will be able to take it, even today it is time to say that.
That is, Swaraj is our birth rights and we will be able to take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrasekhar inspired many youngsters for the bravery and independence of Azad.
He kept his life on a boat, but he did not bow before foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I also got the opportunity to go to Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute these two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and son-in-law, Hima Das, won the Gold in the 400-meter run-off event at the junior under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland.
In response to my letter to another girl unity fear, I have e-mailed from Indonesia that she is now preparing Asian Games there.
The name of the country has been illuminated.
Ekta won Gold and Bronze in World Para Athletics Grand Pre-2018 in Tunisia.
This achievement is special because they have also made their challenges through their actions.
In 2003, due to road accidents, half of the body of the daughter Ekta Bhaiyan has become unemployed, but this daughter has achieved this achievement that she has not been defeated and made herself strong.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has also won the Gold in Pera Athletics Grand Pree in Berlin, Discos Throw, and Sunder Singh Gurjer has also won the Gold in Bhalafank.
My dear countrymen, many incidents of the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to monsoon.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the month of August, and for several festivals that have been going on for centuries, for the inspiration of patriotism.
Once again I will definitely get Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistans first international match and it is a matter of pride for India that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams had performed a very good performance in this match, and also in the IPL this year, and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me and wrote on his Twitter that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have completed a platform to showcase their skills to our players.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's estate of cricket and he also wrote in some funny manner whether or not we will give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some particular reason.
The Indian team has done something that is an example for the whole world.
He said what a team can do while taking the trophy of the Indian team.
The team of Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the team of Afghanistan and photographed both teams.
We can realize what is the Sportsman Spirit and what is the Sportsmanship.
Sports is a very good way to integrate the society and to explore the talent that is among our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that in the same way we will also play with each other, with the entire Sportsman Spirit and will also grow.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different view on the 4th Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, the warriors of the Japanese Navy, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic event and I was told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
The soldiers of India and China simultaneously performed yoga on the high Barfila peaks of Ladakh.
Yoga works to break and connect all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have made this occasion a big festival by going above all kinds of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or sex.
If people from all over the world were taking part in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm, then why would not it be multiplied in India
The country is proud when 1. 25 billion people see that the security forces of our country have practiced yoga at all the places of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga somewhere in Sabarimania and some soldiers performed yoga on the snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force stabbed everyone by performing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet between the sky and the earth.
The sight of seeing was that he did not sit in the plane but did yoga swim in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has taken place everywhere.
A sight of Ahmedabad had touched the heart.
Nearly 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have set up a world class by practicing yoga together at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a quality and revolution.
I hope that the movement of wealth from Yoga will move forward.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
On my Govt and Narendra Modi App, many people wrote to me that this time I will talk about Doctors' Day in Mann Ki Baat on 1st July.
We remember the doctor in a difficult time, but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks to them for their service and dedication to the society.
We are those people who naturally worship Mother as God, believe in God because Mother gives us life.
Mother gives us birth, and sometimes doctors give us birth again.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only.
Today doctors have medical expertise and they have a lot of experience about their general life style trends and their impact on our health.
Indian doctors have made their identity worldwide with their capabilities and skills.
In the Medical Profession, Maharath is also known for the development of our doctors complementary medicinal problems along with hard work.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors on behalf of every countrymen on the occasion of Dr.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in India.
India is a prosperous history when there is no month, there is no such day in which there is no historical incident.
See, every place in India has its own heritage.
There is a saint, a great man, a famous person, everybody contributes to his own.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you will be aware of the graveyard of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had done a very big national session of people belonging to the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabir Dasji Maghar had come
At that time there was a belief that those who died in Magahar do not go to heaven.
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Magahar was considered unclean but Saint Kabir Das did not believe in him.
He worked to break up such evils and superstitions of his time and therefore he went to Magahar and he concluded there.
Saint Kabir Das ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his literature and legends.
They were their ideals.
We see these ideals in their creations and even in today's era they are so inspirational.
He has a story: Kabir Soy Pir Hai, if Pir Janahi on the Pirjas, I am Pirate or true Pir Saint, who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the sufferings of others.
Kabir Das ji stressed on social harmony.
He used to think far ahead of his time.
At that time when the time of the world's falling and the struggle was going on, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked to eradicate the differences by uniting peoples minds.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The system of free kitchens from social discrimination where every caste, pants, religions or sects can come and eat.
Guru Nanak Devjis 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in 2019.
I want all of us to connect with zeal and zeal.
I also urge you people to think about how to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev jis 550th Prakash Parv in the entire society and around the world, how new ideas, however, new ideas, however, new ideas, whatsoever.
The struggle for India's independence is very long, very broad, very strong and full of innumerable civilians.
Punjab is a history associated with it.
In 2017, the horrific events of Jallianwala Bagh are also being completed, which had put humanity in shame.
On 13th April, 11th, the black day can be forgotten when using power, crossing all limits of cruelty, pills were carried out on innocent, unarmed and masked people.
The victory is always peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birth anniversary and he wants Dr.
I would like to talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several sectors but the areas which were closest to them were education, administrators and parliamentaries.
Very few people would know that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at Kolkata University in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone of India and industrial development, prepared a strong base and prepared a strong platform.
The first industrial policy of independent India, which came in 1948, brought a mark of his idea and vision.
The dream of Mukherjee was that India should be industrially self-sufficient, skilled and prosperous in every sector.
He wanted India to develop big entrepreneurs and also pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board was set up between 1948 and 150 to provide financial and organisational support to them for better development of cottage and small enterprises.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a very big contribution.
He was very dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Their understanding, wisdom and activism are the result of a part of Bengal and it is a part of India today.
Dr.
Remember the message of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's unity, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, be connected to India's progress.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video conference.
I got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people by moving ahead of the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness and sadness, their achievements.
Girls in remote villages are providing services from pension to passports to the elderly of the village through the Common Service Centre.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh combines Sitafal and makes a ice cream and businesses.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and going to nearby villages and providing affordable medicines.
I don't know how much the insect was, there would be no corner of the country where people didn't speak of their success.
In such a situation, when a common man comes with a new hope, a new enthusiasm and a decreasing event in his life, it is not the pride of the government.
Even the incident of a small child from a remote village becomes inspiration for 1. 25 billion people.
With the help of technologies, a moment to spend time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very happy and very inspiring.
There is a new joy , a new enthusiasm , a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor .
I am very grateful to the people of the country.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge and you worked to give me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere or the other is good.
There are people who do good.
We can also feel the aroma of goodness.
One thing has come to me in the past and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmers associated with agriculture are brothers and sisters.
Now you will be wondering whether these are two different businesses.
However, in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together and they have made a comfortable prosperity trust and they have activated this trust for doubling the farmers' income.
They continued to connect with the farmers and make jobs and make successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today they are not only producing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through a trust.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to marketing, the farmers have a major role in the entire chain and on the other hand, efforts are being made to ensure the participation of the farmers in profit.
I express my gratitude to these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the professionals, technocrats and engineering world have adopted the way they have come out of their boundaries to connect the farmers with the villages and connect them with the fields.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of my country for their innovative experiments, some of them may have known something, some may not know anything, some may not know, some may not know.
GST is going to complete one year.
One nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country, it has turned into reality today.
If I have to credit anybody for one nation, one tax reform, then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism where all the states have decided together in the country and then such a big tax reform has been implemented in the country.
So far, there have been two meetings of the GST Council and we can all proud that people of different political ideas sit there, people of different states sit there, there are states with different priority but all the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
Before GST, there were 1 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax has been imposed in this system across the country.
GST is a victory of integrity and is also a festival of integrity.
Earlier, many times in the country, the complaints of Inspector Raj were coming in the case of taxes.
With the arrival of GST, the check post has stopped and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but also benefiting in the field of logistics.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a big tax reform was successful in India because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured through manpower.
It is generally believed that such a large economy, such a large country, it takes 5 to 5 years to sustain this large number of people but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the festival of integrity of the country is the result of the participation of manpower that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it continues to improve through its influential system as per requirements.
It has dedicated a very big success to 1. 25 billion people.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for the next Mann Ki Baat to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Through Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to be present before you once again.
You will be well aware that a team of six women commanders of the Navy has been on a sea journey for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I want to talk about it.
These six daughters of India have returned to India on May 21 and the entire country welcomed them very warmly by traveling through the sea through their team buses for more than four days.
He travelled through different oceans and many oceans, about twenty thousand nautical miles.
This was the first such event in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
If we see the development journey of mankind then progress has emerged from some or the other adventure.
You must have seen that in the last few days, some new things have been taken into account in the context of those who have fought on Mount Everest and for centuries, Everest has been criticizing humanity and the brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of five tribal children from a Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, namely, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Kamtode, Vikas Soyam, struck a group of our tribal children at the highest peak of the world.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur school and my young friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to cross the Everest from Nepal.
Best wishes to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter, Diya Everest, became the first Indian father-son to join.
It is not that only youngsters are fighting Everest.
Sangeeta Bahley roamed Everest on May 1, and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old.
There are also some who have fought on Everest who showed that they have not only skills but also sensitivity.
For years, people have been fighting Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these brave persons, especially to the girls.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, two months ago when I talked about Fit India, I didn't think that there would be such a good effect on it.
Such a large number of people from all walks of life will come forward in its support.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we want.
People on social media are sharing a video of fitness challenges, tagging each other and challenging them.
Today everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film or the people associated with the sports world or the people of the country, the soldiers, the teachers of the school, the same tune is heard all around - 'Hum fit to India fit'.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that Virat Kohli, the captain of the Indian Cricket Team, has given me the challenge and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such challenges will encourage us to keep us fit and to keep others fit.
Sixth Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the games that used to be part of the lives of every child are being lost today.
These sports were particularly part of the summer vacation.
There are two types of traditional sports.
It is also outside the house and it is also inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games.
The same game is known by different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It plays with codes or ambli's second or passage and with a square board of 88.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Which of us will be those who have not played Moi Dandia in childhood
Moi Dandia (Previous Danda) is a playing game from villages to cities.
It is known as different names in different parts of the country.
It is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla in Andhra Pradesh.
In Orissa, it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vitidalu.
Some sports used to have a season.
Like there is also a season for wooing kites.
When all the kites fly, when we play, we can express the unique qualities that we have.
You must have seen that many children are of shameful nature but they become very upset during sports.
I express myself that the elders who seem to be serious, the children who are hidden in them during the sports.
Traditional games have become such that along with physical capabilities, our determined thinking, concentration, consciousness and excitement also increase.
From children to grandparents, when all plays, then the people who are called the Generation Gap gets touched somewhere.
Many sports make us aware of society, environment etc.
Today, there is a need to encourage these sports by coming forward in schools, segments, youth organisations.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can create a very large collection of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, our country will be hosting the World Environment Day on the next five years.
It is an important achievement for India and it is a reward for Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is 'Beat Plastic Pollution' plastic waste.
I urge you all to understand the spirit of this theme and to ensure that we do not use polythene, law grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wild life and our health.
Go to the World Environment Day Website-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given very interestingly - see, know and try to bring them to your daily life.
When there is extreme heat, there is a flood, it does not take the name of stoppage of rains, when there is unbearable cold then every person speaks of global warming, climate change, but what does it work to do
In the last few weeks, we all saw that in different areas of the country there were dustbins, heavy rains along with heavy winds, which are commendable.
He also lost his life and lost his life.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in the climate system.
Our culture, our tradition has not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, to be connected to nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had spoken to Dagle for his life.
When India played a key role in the CoP21 and Paris Agreement, when we coordinated the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, there was a feeling of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, we all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can you become innovative
We can aim at enhanced tree plantation this time and not only to plant trees but to maintain it until it grows up.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You remember on 21st June, not only you, but the whole world remembers 21st June.
21 June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
Today, there are reports that strong preparations are going on to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga all over the world.
Yoga for Unity and Hermonios society is a message that the world has felt repeatedly in the last few years.
By doing yoga, there is courage that protects us as a father.
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bharatuhari said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, our sisters, our brothers, ourselves, ourselves, our bed and knowledge.
When all such qualities become friends of someone, the Yogi gets victory over all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge the countrymen to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our heritage of Yoga.
Today, on May 2, India's first largest Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru ji, is the death anniversary.
I salute Panditji.
The memory of this month of May is also linked to another thing and it is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of May in 1985 when the Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were committed to resisting injustice by showing their bravery.
It is a matter of sadness that we have been calling the incidents of 1985 only rebellion or rebellion for a long time.
In fact, this event was really realized as a ignorance, but it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
He was Veer Savarkar, who had written that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but was the first war of independence.
The heroes of India House of London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with fervor.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of features
He was an advocacy of both science and science.
Generally, Veer Savarkar was known for his struggle against his bravery and the British rule, but he was also a poet and a social reformer, who always stressed on sovereignty and unity.
An amazing description of Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had portrayed so much.
Savarkar walked with both poetry and revolution.
Along with being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters who were ever forced to ask the household to sell the garbage - today they are learning the work of sewing and clothing to cover the burden of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future.
He demonstrated that if you have a desire to do something, and for that you are committed, success can also be achieved between all the problems.
And that is not just a matter of Sikar, you will be able to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighborhood then you will be aware of how people defeat problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people present here.
These discussions are also of politics, social, films, sportspersons and sportspersons, or problems of the country - they should be solved in such a way- but most of these things are limited to discussions but some people move forward in the direction of bringing about change from their work, their hard work and attachment.
Mr. D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 0 children are enjoying education in their lives.
He opened a school called ASHA ASHA ASHASAN for children living in huts and spent 50 of their incomes on these poor tea sellers.
It provides education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I'm D.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Prakash Rao for his hard work, his attachment and the new direction to the lives of those poor children.
He has lost the blindness of his life.
Who does not know this vedas of Mother Jyotirgamayam but has shown it alive.
Brightness.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and the entire country.
You will also have a series of such inspirational events around you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Let us move forward positively.
In the month of June, there is so much heat that people wait for rains and in hope they look towards the clouds in the sky.
A few days later, people will also wait for the moon.
The meaning of seeing the moon is to celebrate the Eid.
The festival of Id is a symbol of the commencement of celebrations after one month of fasting during the Ramasan.
I am confident that all people will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm, especially children will get good rewards on this occasion.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the bond of goodwill in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were organised in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
It was attended by one nation of the world, including India.
When there is such a big event, thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, how can you imagine the atmosphere
And when there is such an atmosphere, then who can keep it different from themselves.
Our sportspersons also performed very well on the hopes of the countrymen and won one medal after another.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tanneries or badminton, India has shown records.
26 gold, 20 bronze and 20 bronze- India won about 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for medal winners.
It is a festival of immense pride for all the countrymen.
Perhaps I have less words to express this feeling.
But I want to hear you from these sportspersons.
This time there were many things that happened for the first time.
Do you know that this time the number of workers from India have come up with medals in the Commonwealth Games.
Manika Batra won the medal in all the events.
He is the first Indian woman to win Indias Gold in Individual Table Tennis.
India has got the highest medal shooting.
Sachin Chaudhari is the only Indian Para Power-lifter to win the medal in Commonwealth Games.
This time the games were also special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or shooting, women players have shown their performance.
In the badminton, two Indian players Saina Nehwal and P.
V.
Sindhu had happened.
Athletes participating in sports came from different parts of the country, from small towns.
His friends also contribute to those who have maintained their courage in every situation.
I convey my best wishes to all those sportspersons.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had urged the people of the country, especially our youth, to join the fit India, to lead the fit India.
A gentleman Shri Shashikant Bhonsle has written in a swimming pool that - My dream is my body, my delegation is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, "I feel myself happy and healthy from Morning Walk.
And he further says that for me-fitness courses will be a slight and we should slightly, when we are helpful.
There is no doubt that Happiness is fitness.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Many other youths have also shared their experiences by connecting with the benefits of India.
I understand that such movements are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
On 21st June International Day of Yoga, the entire world has accepted it.
You will also be ready.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been shown is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now come out of the cycle of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate holidays and how to go.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live and experience life away from the computer.
My young friends, I call upon you today for a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it sports, HRD or drinking water department, the three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched this Swachh Bharat Summit International 2018.
The students and students of the college, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nuhru Yuva Kendra who want to do something for the society, for the country and for the sake of learning, for the transformation of society, for the sake of connecting themselves, for the sake of living, for the sake of a positive energy, for all, this is an opportunity for all and for the sanitation will also be strengthened and before October 2, we will get satisfaction from the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Each intern who successfully completed this internship will be given a certificate through the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only this, the UGC will also give them two credit points that the internet will fulfil it very well.
I once again invite students, students and youth to take advantage of it for the internship.
You can go to MyGov app and register for the Swachh Bharat Summit Internship.
I hope that our youth will further pursue this Swachhta movement.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your guests, send storeys, send photographs, send video.
Let us make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience.
I have seen in the past days that the youth of Delhi were showing things that are feeling unsuccessful for education of poor children.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in huts near Gita Colossal in Delhi, has been connected to 12 places in the capital today.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this mission are engaged in this vicious effort of social transformation by extracting a free time of 2 hours from their busy daily.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
Their organized efforts not only changed their fate but also their fate.
Bageshwar of Uttarakhand is mainly a crop of Ragi, Rajgara, Makai or Java.
Due to being a hilly area, the farmers could not get the right value.
But the farmers of Kapkot Taluka adopted the path of value addition instead of selling this crop directly into the market.
What he did - He started making biscuits from this component and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have formed a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a biscuit factory.
The system has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission by looking at the braveness of the farmers.
This budget is now being delivered not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausui.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs, but more than 10000 families have also started stopping from getting employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there is a war with water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks this, but whether we have any responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be that social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it to live for centuries.
He has given priority to the importance of one drop of water.
He has discovered such new solutions how to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where in the temples, irrigation system, water conservation system, duration management and its large inscriptions have been written.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will be able to see big inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then you must take the moonlight boat in Jodhpur.
It is one of the largest and beautiful forests in India and it is a matter of note that it is in the region where there is a lack of water.
April , May , June , July is such a time that there is an excellent opportunity to accumulate rain water and if we prepare in advance then we get the benefits.
MNREGA's budget is also useful for this water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has made efforts towards water conservation and water management in its own way.
Every year about Rs. 32 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation and water management from Manrega Budget.
Talking about 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore, i. e.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through this kind of water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have taken a lot of benefits from the budget received by the Government of India for water conservation and water management.
Thousands of people working on the river Kuttumperur in Kerala revived the river by working hard for 0 days.
Ganga and Yamuna are rivers full of water but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh, like two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system speeded up a large number of soil and water conservation work under Manrega.
With the help of about 40-45 villages, this Sasur Khadi river, which had dried up, revived it.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, this is a success of blessings.
I will say that once again, April, May, June, July are in front of us, take responsibility for water conservation and water conservation.
When there is Mann Ki Baat then I get messages from all sides, papers and phones.
INKUMAR BENREGI, Deotala village of North 24 Pargans of West Bengal, has written in my comments on MyGov, we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many people do not know about the Peacefully, Beautifully and Integrity of Nobel Prize winner Ravindranath Tagore.
Discuss this issue in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can know about it.
I thank I ji that the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat was attracted towards this.
Gurudev Tagore was a full personality with knowledge and wisdom, which has left a mark on everybody.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a lot of personality, but a teacher within him can feel every moment.
He wrote in Geetanjali, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to those students.
I don't know the Bengali language, but when I was young, I had a habit of getting up very soon - from childhood and radio of East India starts soon.
When the delay in western India begins, I guess it was probably at 5.30 a.m. and I had a habit of radio and it.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on radio early in the morning. And when I used to hear the poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmo, I got a consciousness.
You must have been influenced by Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The social aspect of Rosa is that when a person is hungry then he also feels the hungryness of others.
When he himself feels thirsty then he feels the thirst of others.
This is an occasion to remember the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood from their lives.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what is the best thing in Islam
Paigambar Saheb said, You know whether to feed a poor and needy person and meet everyone with goodwill, whether you know him or not.
Paigambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
They didn't have any pride.
He used to say that ego defeats knowledge.
Paigbar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have any goods more than required then you will give it to a needy person, that is why donation is also very important in the Ramadan.
People donate to the needy in this holy month.
Paigambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is purified with his soul, not with wealth.
We must be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima recalls the responsibility of all of us to remember Lord Buddha, try to walk on his path.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values that are the highest in the world today.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social physics.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people who were buried in laughter, suffering, exploited, deprived.
It cannot be a big example of compassion.
This compassion for the pain of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and they used to follow the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and they used to happen at every time.
We have got the teachings of Lord Buddha in the entire Asia.
It is the reason that we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of Southeast Asia, Indias special Buddhist places.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India is a part of the revival of many Buddhist temples, including the centuries old glorious Anand Temple in Myanmar.
Today, the education of Lord Buddha shows the way to eradicate hatred and destruction everywhere.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and faith in Lord Buddha across the world.
I bless Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfil our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we recall Lord Buddha, you must have heard of the statues of Lafing Buddha, about which it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event of India's defense history.
You must be wondering what is the relationship between smiling Buddha and India's military power
You will remember that on the evening of May 11, 18, 20 years ago, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had addressed the nation and his words filled the country with pride, pride and happiness.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 18th, on the west side of India, atomic tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Indias testing was successful and in a way, India had exhibited its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that the day has been marked as an exhibition of its military power in India's history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world, it is essential for the inner strength, the strength of the inner force and peace.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a country, you can also be peaceful with all of you.
The month of May 18 is not only important for the country that atomic tests were conducted in this month, but it was done in the same way.
He showed the world that Indias land is a land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can achieve the heights and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given a mantra - Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan Jai-Scientific.
In view of this, we will also be able to achieve a new joy and satisfaction to move forward the journey that Atal ji had launched.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more again when I will meet in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy occasion of Ramnavami.
We have seen the strength of the name Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment.
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were here, they had brought a cultural troop with them and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana before us.
That is, Ramayana and Ramayana, not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this region of the world, are still inspiring and impressing.
Once again I convey my best wishes to your brother Ramanvami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakkar ji wrote about the launch of Sanskrit online course on MyGov.
It was very happy to see your love for Sanskrit with the help of being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to get information about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also like to urge the sages of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit to think about what can be done in the context of the suggestions of Kamal ji.
Shriman Dhanshyamkumar ji, Village Barak, District Nalanda, Bihar.
The concern that you have expressed on the level of decreasing water on the ground is very important.
Mr. Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have also requested everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
I have delivered your feelings to all the Shrotas.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha ji said that this time I will talk to the youth about their health.
They feel that compared to Asian countries, our youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone in detail about health.
And you can also run the footsteps of Fit India together with all the youngsters.
In the last few days, the French Prime Minister had visited Kashi and Shriman Passenger of Varanasi has written that all the views of this journey were influential and impressive.
He urged all those reports to be published on video social media.
The Prime Minister said that the Government of India had put those inventions on social media and Narendra Modi App on the same day.
Now you lick them and retweet them, send them to your friends.
He has sent me only by writing about the ideas that Anna, Jaisal and many children have given the Gratitude Cards behind the Exam Warrior book from Chennai.
Andha, Jayesh, I would like to tell you all the children that these letters of yours cause the fatigue of my day.
All such letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I could read, whatever I could hear and there are many things that have touched my mind, but perhaps for months I have to go on to say something continuously.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about the examination.
He has said his plan on holidays.
In summer, water is concerned for animals and birds.
The letters of farmers brothers and sisters have come to the fore about the activities that are going on in the field of farming and agriculture.
Some active citizens have sent instructions on water conservation.
During the festivals, our festivals, our culture and our traditions are discussed.
That is, the words of our minds also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the words of our minds also change the weather of somebody's life.
And why not
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples, inspire, all the energy, all the self-reliance, the country has the desire to do something.
It has the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters, how a rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmad Ali, has made new schools for poor children through his will, then this country's immense will power is visible.
In this mission, Sadul sold household houses and collected money through donation.
Many travellers traveling in their cab gave generous donations.
An engineer girl gave her first step
Thus, after 12 years of collection of rupees, Sadul Laskar brought the color of the Bhagirath effort and today due to his hard work, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in the village of Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed all over the world.
Today, there is a belief in the youth, women, the backward, the poor, the middle class and every section of the country.
We can move forward and our country can move forward.
The hopes and hopes have become a positive environment of confidence.
This confidence, this positiveness will fulfil our vision of New India and accomplish our dreams.
My dear countrymen, for the coming few months, it is very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come about agriculture.
This time, I also visited the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan by asking for a deliberations with the farmers and I feel that every farmer should be connected to this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and should implement these experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devilal ji, all of them considered agriculture as an important part of the economy and the common man's lives.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji stressed on the need for plants, trees and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of greater public awareness for ensuring better income, better irrigation facilities and food and milk production for our farmers.
In his speech in 1918, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji stressed the need for the farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
I had visited the Agricultural Advanced Fair in Delhi in the last few days.
It was a pleasant experience for me, but what influenced me was the hard work of Meghalaya and its farmers.
This state with less area has shown a very big work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced virtuous products over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goals are determined, the objectives are uncertain and if there is a resolve in the mind, it can be proved and shown.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is being supported by technology, which is providing a lot of strength to the agricultural producer.
In the letters that have come to me, I was watching that many farmers had written about the spirit of support and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, A big decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide the right price of crops to the farmers.
It has been decided that the cost of support for notified crops will be announced at least one and a half times their expenditure.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages with the Whelse Market and then the global market.
To ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their produce, 22 thousand rural Haats of the country will be upgraded with necessary interface and connected with APMC and e-NAM platforms.
In a way, there is a direct connectivity to any market in the country with farming.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How will the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our vision and how can the people of 1. 25 billion people be able to pay homage to Gandhiji
How can new activities be given for this
I urge you all to share your ideas with all through MyGov.
How is the logo of Gandhi 150
You should inform yourself about how the slogan or mantra or slaughter words are.
Together we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and to bring our country to new heights by taking inspiration from Bapu.
Thank you, you have said the truth and I believe that Swachh Bharat and healthy India are both supplementary.
Today, the country has moved ahead of the traditional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was just the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, whether it is the Ministry of cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, or the State Governments, is working together for healthy India and the emphasis is on health care.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we are aware of the preventive health care, the more people, the family and the society will also benefit.
For a healthy life, the first need is: cleanliness.
We all have raised the bed as a country and the result of this was that in the last four years, sanitation coverage has doubled to about 80 percent.
Besides, work is being done at a wide range in the direction of setting up of Health Wellness Centres across the country.
This is the result of all of uss commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This time, the International Day of Yoga - 21st June has survived less than 100 days.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people from all over the country and the world participated with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire all the families and friends to do yoga.
In a new interesting way, Yoga has to be popularized in children, youth, elderly, in all ages, men or women.
Although the TV and electronic media of the country do different programmes regarding Yoga during the year, can you create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I am a Yoga Practiceer, but some people have made me Yoga teachers through their creativity and have made 3D animated videos by doing my yoga.
I will share that video with you all so that we can practice asanas and pranayama at the same time.
Efforts are also being made on a wide scale to ensure that health care is within access and nutritious or affordable for the common man.
The cost of heart stents has been reduced to 85 percent for heart patients.
In the current 4 medical colleges of the country, the number of MBBS seats has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being set up in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We all will see a collective effort to get rid of B.
Years ago Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
Industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest.
Today, when the campaign for Make in India is going on successfully, Dr.
Today, the vision of Ambedkar ji's dream of India as an industrial power is inspiring for us.
Today, India is emerging as a brightest point in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment in the world is coming to India.
The entire world is looking at India as a centre for investment, innovation and development.
The development of industries was possible only in cities, due to which Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization of India.
They don't want any person to live his life in poverty.
Along with this, he also believed that their poverty cannot be removed by distributing only a few of the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Startup India, Standup India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke about ports and waterways when only roads and railways were spoken in India in the decade of 130 and 140.
He's Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as the nations strength.
Babasaheb Ambedkar had a vision of various River Valley Authoritys and Water related Commissions.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different coasts of India and the interface on old ports is being strengthened.
During the 40th century, most of the discussions were on World War II, Cold War and Division.
Ambedkar laid the Foundation Stone of Team India Spirit in a way.
He spoke of the importance of Federalism, and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and beyond all aspects of governance, and the most important thing is that Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me.
He has shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary to be born in a big or immortal family, but people born in the poor families of India can also see their dreams, they can try to fulfil their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it was also made that many people had come to Dr.
The poor and backward families could not move forward, nothing could be done, they could not achieve anything in their lives.
But New India's discovery is quite different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor and to the backward.
Under this, there will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge you people to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to come in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester, Vaishali.
The day of Lord Mahavir's birth anniversary is to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The philosophy of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ recall the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to the everlasting humanity.
In April, Punjab and West India will be celebrated as the festival of Vaisakhi, these days, Judasheel and Satvina in Bihar, Bihu in Assam, and Poila Vaishakh in West Bengal will be celebrated.
All these festivals are somehow connected to our farming fields and foodgrains, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts that we get in the form of produce.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all the festivals that come to you.
Mann Ki Baat February, 2018
My dear countrymen, today, Namaskar is launching Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We have seen that the color of the sea appears blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that whether it is a river or a sea, why water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the decade of the 120s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
Raman's name comes to us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on lighting i. e.
One of his discovery is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate the National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that this day, the event of light scattering was discovered, for which he was awarded Nobel Prizes.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there is a tradition of great analyst Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhat, while on the other hand, we are proud and pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
In the name of Satyendranath Bose, the well-known particle Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in science.
This technique can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I urged the scientific community to help with artificial intelligence to facilitate the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can Artificial Intelligence be helpful in facilitating healthcare and eliminating modern diseases
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got the opportunity to go to the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There, a young man has developed a digital instrument that if no one can speak, he writes his words through instruments and he can communicate in the same way as one can speak.
I understand that we can use artificial intelligence in many ways.
Science and technology values are baseless.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do as we want.
However, it depends on us what we want to work from the machine.
Here human vision becomes important.
Use of science for the welfare of humanity, to achieve the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who invented the light bulb, has been unsuccessful in his experiments.
Unfortunately, today I am in Auroville, the workplace of the Maharshi Arabs.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British government, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he asked all aspects of life.
Searched the answer and waited for mankind.
The feeling of asking questions is often important to know the truth.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific research.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to all our scientists and scientists.
My best wishes are to our younger generations to be inspired to explore truth and knowledge, to serve society with the help of science.
Friends, People keep writing something or the other of these issues of safety and complications.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken about the occupational safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that the criteria of security on Factory and Construction Sites are not good in our country.
On March 4, India's National Safety Day, the Prime Minister spoke of the security in his Mann Ki Baat program so that people get aware of the safety.
When we talk about public peace, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other preparedness.
There are two types of security - one that is necessary during your time, the safety during discipline and the other that needs daily life, the safety in averse life.
If we are not aware of the safety in everyday life, then it becomes difficult to get it during yourself.
We are reading the boards written on the paths often. It has been written that there is a reduction in alertness and accidents, losses, losses, joys and joys and gestures, do not leave the world at the earliest, don't enjoy any fun from security to anybody.
If we are cautious and follow the required rules then we can save our lives, but we can also foster the society with greater accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that many suggestions are written on safety at the workplace but whenever they want, they do not seem to be following it.
I urge you people to go to different schools once a week or once a month and drive them in front of school children.
It will have two advantages - the Fire Brigade will also have the habit of being alert and the new generation will also get its teachings and there will be no different costs for it. In a way, education remains a sequence and I have always been urging this thing.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDM) is leading the exchanges in the country.
The initiative of 'Apada Mitra' has also been taken for the training of volunteers in floods, cyclone hazards.
Training and awareness plays a very important role.
Two-three years ago thousands of people used to lose their lives every year from Lu-Heatways.
Subsequently, NDMM organised workshops to prevent highways and launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
The partnership of everyone has led to a good result.
The number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 has been surprisingly reduced to approximately 20.
It can be known that if we give preference to security then we can get protection.
There are innumerable people working in the society, be it social organisations or awakening citizens, I would like to describe all those people who have been involved in relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is not less.
(BIMSTEC) - Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal also carried out a Joint Disaster Management Exercise of these countries which was one of the first and largest human experiments.
We have to become a Risk Conscience Society.
In our culture, we always talk about the protection of values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
Is it the meaning of giving information
Because we don't get awakened by nature and for this we listen to our ears and airplanes, but none of us feels that this instruction is for me.
This kind of experience is in every field of our lives.
We should not think that the safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our security then the spirit of security of society is also included.
The objective of this Gobardhan scheme is to make the villages clean and convert the waste of livestock into compounds and bio-gasses and generate wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use cattle dung and other biological injustice to generate energy but its full potential is not being used in India.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are now moving forward in this direction.
The goal of making use of dung dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchens and biogas based energy has been determined.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as waste but also as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase.
Biogas will enhance self-reliance in energy matters for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in enhancing income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be set up for the smooth management of the Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers with the buyers so that the farmers can get the right value of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India to come forward and make a self-help group and take full advantage of this opportunity by making cooperative committees.
I invite you to become participants of this movement of clean energy and green jobs. Initiate towards converting waste into wealth in your village and making dung grains from dung.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about the music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh in which the first waste festival was organized in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur City Corporation was to create awareness about the creative use of waste of the city and various ways of rehabilitation of the garbage.
During this Festival, there were several activities that included students to older people, all.
Different types of artworks were created using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management.
The theme of Cleanliness was Music Performance and Art Work was created.
Being inspired by Raipur, various kinds of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Innovative ideas have been discussed and poems were read by everyone on behalf of their parents.
An atmosphere like a festival has been prepared for sanitation.
In particular, the way school children participated in enthusiastically, it was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur City Corporation, the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration for the innovative way in which the importance of waste management and sanitation has been shown in this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Shakti Puraskar in the country is also felicitated by women who have worked in different fields in the past.
I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life. It is the responsibility of all of us.
We are part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhiputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women's strength has introduced self-reliance and self-reliance with their works.
He has not only moved ahead but has also worked to take the country and society forward and take it to a new chatti.
Finally, this is the dream of our New India where women are empowered, empowered, equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the past, somebody had made me a very beautiful instruction.
He suggested that on 8th March, a number of programmes are being organized to celebrate Womens Day. Can the honour of the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village-urban be organized
And I am happy to think about it, I am reaching you.
Nearly 15 lakh women under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and this figure is not small, 15 lakh women organized a month-long Swachhta Abhiyan.
Starting from 26th January 2018, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 0 thousand toilets in just 20 days under this campaign.
You can imagine how big this is happening
These women of Jharkhand have shown that womens strength is the strength of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into the nature of the people.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and that is why there is a lot of fervor and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know that Elephanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
I am surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephants for so many years of independence.
For 0 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sethbandar, have been darkened in the lives of the people there and their lives have become bright.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is not only electricity but also a new beginning of development partnership.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness, the life of the people of the country be bright and happy in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We have recently celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
This is the speciality of the month of March, the golden blossom of the fields enjoyed by the flourishing crops, and the beauty of the pomegranate pomegranate that enjoys the heart.
But this month, for the festival of Holi, we all are very favoured.
On March 2, the entire country will celebrate Holi with fervor.
The importance of Holi is as important as Holika Dahan because this day is a day to destroy the evils by burning in fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to be a part of each other's pleasure and a message of love integrity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to your fellow countrymen for the festival of Holi.
This festival will be full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Festival with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history, the leaders of 10 countries were present at this event.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on the Narendra ModiApp and has urged me to touch the issues written in his letter.
He writes that on February 1, the imagination of the space is Chawla's death anniversary.
He left us in the Columbia Space Yan accident but inspired millions of youth around the world.
I am grateful to brother Prakash ji for imagining his long letter by farewell to Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we have lost imagination at such a young age but they have given a message to thousands of women from all over the world, especially in India that there is no limit for women's strength.
If there is a strong desire and determination to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is heartening to see that in India today women are moving forward at a rapid pace in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place in society and their contributions have been surprised all over the world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian pollutants.
Many of Indias demonstrators have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Friends, there are many names.
Today, we talk about 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' but centuries ago, in our scriptures, Skandapuran, it has been said: 'Dashaputra Samakanya, Dasaputran Promotion.
The qualities that ten daughters will get from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And only then, women have been given the status of Shakti in our society.
This women's strength binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the instrument of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has given many examples further.
He writes that our brave defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is inspiring to fly in the fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30.
He also mentioned that under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the Indian Navy Women Crew Members are performing on the INSV category all over the world.
Three brave women have become emotional knots, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Fitter Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Shakti Vajpayee, All Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Air India Boying Jet from Delhi and all the women back.
In the last few days, Honble President ji took a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who first performed something in the field of self-determination.
This Women Accountants of the country, the first woman merchant Navy Captain, the first woman train driver of the passenger train, the first woman firefighter, the first woman bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, thus the first ladies of every sector.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the orthodoxy of society.
He said that a new path can be created by crossing all the hurdles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, linkage and determination.
A road that will not only inspire our contemporary people but also generations to come.
I will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on the First Ladies, this Women's Secretary, has also been prepared so that the entire country can know about these women's strengths, inspire them from their lives and their work.
It is also available in the form of e-book on Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women power plays an important role in positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I want to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you will be wondering what is the relationship between these two
Matunga Station of Mumbai is the first station in India where all women workers are.
In all the departments, be it Women Staff or Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Chackers, Inaugurators, Point Persons, more than 40 employees have staff of women.
This time, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after watching the Republic Day Parade that one of the key points of the parade was the BSF Baicker Continent in which married women were participating.
He was experiencing adventurous experiments and the scene was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women's strength is leading.
When the words of tribal women come, there is a certain distinction in the minds of all, there are wilderness, footprints, and the burden of woods on them is lifted up on the head.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women's strength has created a new inspiration against the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible environment for violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
In such a dangerous area, tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running E-Rikshaw.
Many women have been associated with it in a very short span of time.
And there are three benefits from this, on the one hand, where self-employment has worked to empower them, on the other hand, the scope of Maoist-affected areas is changing.
And with all these, it is also strengthening the work of environmental protection.
For centuries, continuous efforts have been made in our country at personal and social level against social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago Bihar has taken an interesting initiative.
The world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers of Human chain, Human chain, was built to root out social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, people were awakened against evils such as childhood and genocide.
The entire State took a pledge to fight crimes such as groom and child marriage.
Children, adults, youngsters, mothers and sisters, who were full of zeal and zeal.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, the human range has been unbrokenly connecting the borders of the state.
It is important for all the people of the society to get the benefits of development in true sense that our society is free from these evils.
Come, let us take a pledge to finish all these evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration there and every person involved in human chains who have made such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of society.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Mysore, Karnataka has written that the cost of medicines was Rs. 6,000 per month on the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendra earlier.
But now when they came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 5.
He expressed his desire that I would talk about it in Mann Ki Baat programme so that most of the people can get information and benefit from it.
For the past few years, many people used to write to me about this.
I have also seen the video and social media of many people who have benefitted from this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information, I am very happy.
A deep satisfaction.
And I am also very happy that Shriman Darshan ji's mind has come to know that whatever he got was also given to others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 0 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the people, especially senior citizens who take medicines everyday, to a great extent of economic help.
The generic medicines sold in it are in accordance with the principle of World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for industrial enterprises.
Affordable medicines are available at the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores of Hospitals.
The only objective behind all of them is to make the poorest of the country accessible to quality and effective healthcare so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mange from Maharashtra, Narendra Modi has shared a photograph on the mobile app.
It was such a picture that my attention was drawn towards those photographs.
The photographs were in which a grandson was participating in the Clean Morana River Cleanliness Mission with his grandfather.
I came to know that the people of Akola had organised a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the river Morana under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The river of Mora was flowing for twelve months earlier but now it has become a seasonal.
Another sad thing is that the river was completely filled with wild animals and water bodies.
Some wastes were being put on the river and its banks.
A Action Plan was prepared and a day before Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, under the first phase of Mission Clean Morana, the two coasts of Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in four kilometres.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters, everybody participated in this work of Mission Clean Moor.
On January 20, 2018, this Swachhta programme was also continued in such a way and I was told that this campaign will run every Saturday morning until the river of Morana is completely cleaned.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then nothing is impossible.
Big changes can be brought through the mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the city corporation and every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you will be able to hear many discussions about Padma Awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, it attracts attention on TV.
But if you look closely, you will be proud, how the great people are among us and naturally it will be proud of how the common man in our country is reaching these heights without any feeling.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards, but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Any citizen can nominate anybody.
The entire process has become transparent due to online.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become completely transformed.
Now the significance of his work is not being identified for the award.
You must have heard that Shriman Arvind Gupta ji, you will be happy to know that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has dedicated his entire life to making sports for children.
They have been making sports from waste for four decades so that the curiosity of science can increase in children.
Their efforts are to inspire children towards scientific experiments from useless things, for which they are going to three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages.
How amazing life, how wonderful dedication.
This is the same thing as Sitawa Jodthy of Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself to Goddess at the age of seven, but then he spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of married women.
You must have heard the name of Madhya Pradesh's brother-in-law Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family.
He used to do ordinary jobs for livelihood, but he was keen to make traditional tribal pictures.
Today, because of this grief, he is not only in India but also in the whole world.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who illuminated India's name abroad, was recognized and honored with Padmashree.
You will be surprised to hear about the tribal woman Laxmikutti of Kerala.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area between dense forests.
He has made five hundred herbal medicines based on his memory.
He is getting Maharath in making medicines used after snake bites.
Lakshmiji is continuously serving the society with herbal medicines.
He was honoured with Padmashree for his contribution to the society by recognising this infamous person.
Subhasi's Egyptian is a woman who sold vessels and vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23, his wife died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to become a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hard work hospital.
I am sure there are many men and women in our multi-patriotic basindhara, whom no one knows or somebody knows.
The Padma Awards are a medium but I will also tell the people of the country that there are lakhs of people living near us, those who are dedicated to the society, those who work with some specialty and sometimes they should be brought to the society.
He does not work for dignity, but his work inspires us.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, some efforts should be made in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is the 9th January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the festival of untouched bonds between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, we had organized a programme on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in which all the members and mayors of the Indian origin living around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that this event was attended by each of our original Indian mayors from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America and other countries where the original Indian Parliamentarians are.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries and they have also made their strong links with India. This time, the European Union, the European Union have sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contribution in different fields by the Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who live in different countries of Europe, some are working in cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some are dedicated to their music and some poems.
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, to recognise the people of Indian origin and to inform the people of the world through them.
On January 30, it is the death anniversary of revered Bapu who has shown us a new path.
At present, we see how true Bapu's words were.
If we resolve to walk on the path of Bapu, how much can we walk, then what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Mann Ki Baat December, 2019
This is the last year's event of Mann Ki Baat and see that today is also the last day of the year 2019.
We and you shared a lot of things this year.
This exchange of thoughts and letters for Mann Ki Baat always brings me a new energy.
The year will change after a few hours but this sequence of our words will continue in the same way.
In the coming year, we will make more innovative and new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Today, on 25th December, the festival of Natal is celebrated with great fanfare all over the world.
Even in India, people celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recall the great teachings of Christ, and the most emphasised thing Isha Christ was Sevabhava.
My dear countrymen, this year Guru Gobind Singh ji's 350th birth anniversary was also the year.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji suggested the values of great life and he lived his life on the basis of these values of life.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against oppression and injustice.
He advised people to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave a place to the feeling of hatred.
The message of love, sacrifice and peace in every moment of life was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all the pledges and take inspiration from Guru Gobind Singh ji's great teachings and inspiration from his inspirational life.
Those who are born in 2000 or after that will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century New India voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge all of you to register as your voter.
The entire India is keen to welcome you as a voter of the 21st century.
You will also be proud as a voter of the 21st century.
Your opinion will be the foundation of New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
Mat is the most effective instrument to bring about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
You can also become the builder of India of the 21st century and it is being started specially from January 1.
And today, in this Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our youngsters full of energy and determination of 18-25 years.
I am confident that our talent and strength of these talented youth will realize our dream of a New India.
When we talk about New India, New India is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India where there is equal opportunities for everyone, where the aspirations and aspirations of everyone are fulfilled.
New India where our inspiration is the strength of peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth will come forward and demonstrate how to become a New India.
They should also set a path for themselves, connect them with which they are connected and this convoy continues to move forward.
You have also moved ahead and the country has also moved ahead.
Now when I am talking to you, I came to an idea that can we organise a mock parliament in every district of India
Where these 18-25-year-old youth sit together and work on New India, find ways and plans.
How will we prove our commitments before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters had dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for the grand and divine India of the 21st century.
How to achieve achieved by संकल्प .
Today there are many new opportunities for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and innovation, our youth are coming forward and successful.
I would like to know about all these occasions, how to get this New India Youth at one place and a system should be set up in this regard so that at the time of the age of 18, they can easily get information about the world, and they can also get the necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I talked about the importance of positiveness.
I recall a volume of Sanskrit. This means that a person full of enthusiasm is very strong because nothing can be beyond enthusiasm.
Nothing is impossible for a positive and zealous person.
People in English also say, 'Passimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power'.
In Mann Ki Baat last year, I urged the countrymen to share your positive moments of the year 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive impact on the social media platform, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
There were lakhs of tweets with the Positive India Healthcare which reached more than 1. 5 billion people.
In a way, the communication of positiveness that happened in India spread all over the world.
The tweets and reflections that came were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have shared this year's events that had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
Sound byte is my name Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Face One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vad.
I am talking to the body.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
He was done by my wife and he died in an accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
With this help of the government, we have benefitted a lot and I can sit down a little.
My name is satisfactory.
From our village, the National Highway has passed since 2019 from Bhinnar village.
This will improve our roads and also increase trade.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Beni.
There was a problem of water in our area and for the last 40 years we had to depend on the Armeni pipeline.
Now this pipeline has become independent.
So these are the greatest achievements in our 2019.
There are many people who are doing such things at their own level, due to which there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Come, let us enter the new year with the joys of this little one, start a new year and take a strong step towards 'Positive India'.
When we talk about positiveness, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirational aspects of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatk, the tower of administrative service in Kashmir.
He has secured the first place in the examination of Kashmir Administrative Service by expelling out of the piece of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th century the terrorists had burnt their native house.
There was so much of terrorism and violence that their family had to leave their native land.
For a small child, the atmosphere of such violence all around him was sufficient to create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that however bad the situation may be, the clouds of depression can also be distributed through positive work.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
And when I was listening to them, they want to progress in the field of life.
The time I spent with these daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about Sabarimala Temple in Kerala not only of our country but also of the world's famous religious places.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees come here every year to take the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami.
Where there are such a large number of devotees, where there is such a great importance, it is a big challenge to maintain cleanliness.
And especially in the place where the mountains and jungles are located.
However, the Sabarimala Temple is an example of how this problem can be converted into a culture, how to find out the way out of the problem and how it is so powerful in public participation.
P.
A police officer, Vijayan, launched a programme, Punyam Punkavanam, and launched a voluntary campaign for cleanliness.
And made a tradition that the journey of those travellers will not be fulfilled unless they do any physical work in the cleanliness programme.
There is no bigger or smaller in this campaign.
Every traveller gives some time to hygiene, works and works to eradicate the dirt by considering it as a part of the worship of God.
Everyday in the morning the view of cleanliness is very amazing and all pilgrimages take place in it .
Whether it is a big CELEBRITY or a rich person, whether it is a big officer, every person becomes a part of this Punyam Rejuvenation programme like a common traveller.
We have many such examples for the countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala and the Purniyam Revival in it become part of the journey of every traveller.
There is a strong commitment to cleanliness along with a strong commitment.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we all have decided that the incomplete work of revered Bapu i. e.
The revered Bapu continued to live for this work and also tried.
And we all decided that when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we will do something in the direction of giving him a Swachh Bharat, his dream.
Efforts are being made on a wide scale across the country in the direction of cleanliness.
Transformation has also been seen in rural and urban areas.
The worlds largest survey Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the Swachhta level achievements in urban areas.
This survey will be done in more than four thousand cities in a population of about 40 crore.
In this survey, the facts that will be discussed in the cities, the innovative efforts made for open defecation, the collection of waste, the transport system to carry the waste, the scientific processing of the waste, the efforts being made for non-violent change, and the innovative efforts made for cleanliness and public participation for this work.
During this survey, there will be an interpretation of cities in different ways.
He will speak to the people and react to them.
Use of Swachhata App and analysis of improvement in various services.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes a habit of the people.
Cleanliness should not be done only by the government.
Every civil and civil organisation has a very big responsibility.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the cleanliness that is going to be served in the coming days.
And if your city is not left behind, your streets are not behind.
I am sure that the use of green and blue wastes by separating dry wastes and wet wastes from the house would have become your habit.
In the Swachhata Survekshan conducted during the 4th January to 10th March 2018, it should be a matter of public discussion in every city.
And your brothers should have a dream, our city- our effort, our progress- the progress of the country.
Let us once again recall the revered Bapu and take a pledge of Swachh Bharat and pursue the Purusharth.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small, but in the form of a society, we have to influence our identity far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I want to share this kind of thing with you.
One thing in our information was that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without 'Maharam' or 'Male Guardian'.
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how can this happen
Who would have made such rules
Why is such a difference
And when I went into its depths, I was troubled - even after 0 years of independence, we were the people who used to set up such destinations.
For decades there was injustice to Muslim women but there was no discussion about it.
Even in many Islamic countries, this rule is not there.
But Muslim women in India did not get this authority.
And I am happy that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken necessary steps and we have destroyed this structure by eliminating the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without pride and I am glad that this time about 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Haj without pride and women from different parts of the country - from Kerala to north - have expressed their desire to go to Haj.
I am convinced that Indias development journey, on the strength of our women's strength, has moved forward with the trust of their talent.
Our constant efforts should be made that our women also get equal rights, equal opportunities, so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us.
This time on Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests.
This has never happened before in India's history.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed its 50 years in 2017 and has completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2019.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this festival is a season and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we have celebrated Christmas and the new year is going to come.
The coming New Year brings you a lot of happiness, happiness and prosperity.
We all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new commitments and take the country forward.
The month of January is the time for the sun to rise and this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
If there is no pleasure in Lohri in Punjab and Northern India, then the UP-Bihar waits for swing and sweetness.
Say Sankrant in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, these festivals are special in themselves and they have their own importance.
Each festival is celebrated from 13th to 1st January.
The names of all these festivals are different, but its roots are the same - connectivity with nature and agriculture.
I extend my best wishes to every countrymen.
Once again my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that interacts with a lot of talent, younger brothers and their elder sisters.
Listen, how in this phase of AYUSH, Lata Devi is enthusiastic for all the things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in Indias progress, changing India, new heights are in India.
Modi ji: Lata ji, Pranam.
I am speaking to Narendra Modi.
Lata Devi: Pranam.
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birth anniversary...
When will you go back to the layer
Modi ji: I will return late at night on 28th and on the 2nd morning and then you will be born.
Lataji: It is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are very big at the age and you are also bigger in work and the achievement that has been achieved has been achieved by instruments and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think my parents are blessings and the blessings of the sages.
I don't have anything.
Modi ji: Yes, today is your humility, it is a great education for all our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after doing so much clarity in our lives, your parents have always given priority to the culture and humility.
Lataji: Yes.
Modi ji: And I am glad that when you are proud that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you: G. Modi ji: Give me something Gujarati.
I know that your arrival is changing the picture of India and I am very happy with it.
No, I don't want to give you much trouble because I see how busy you are and how much you work.
What do you have to think
When you visited and touched the feet of your mother, I had also sent somebody to him and received his blessings.
Yeah.
Modi ji: My father was very happy because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will be very soon.
It would be my privilege.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
Lataji: Excellent salute to you.
Modi ji: Pranam ji.
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new emotions, new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolves.
Festivals are on the occasion.
For the next few weeks, the festivals across the country will be commendable.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this is not just a word, it is an order for all of us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
In some houses the sweets get spoiled, while in some houses the children sweeten.
This is the darkness of the lamp.
The real joy of these festivals is when this darkness comes down, this darkness spreads.
We also share happiness where there is lack and it becomes our nature.
Imagine to give one moment to the other if there is delivery of sweets, clothes and gifts in our houses.
At least, share the things that we don't work in our houses in abundance.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends of many NGs do such work.
He collects clothes, sweets, bhojs and everything from the houses of the people and finds the needy and reaches them.
Can this time, with full awareness and determination in this festivals, eradicate darkness on this lamp
The smile on the face of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals and your face will be bright.
Your brightness will become more bright, your brightness will be more bright.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmiji comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Laxmi ji is welcome in traditional form.
Can we take the honour of our society, villages, cities and daughters this time
Can you hold public programmes
We will have many daughters who have been shining the name of the family, the society and the country with their hard work and engagement.
Can we celebrate this celebration of Indias Lakshmi on this Deepavali
There will be many daughters and sisters around us who have been doing extraordinary work.
If someone is working to teach a poor child, if someone is engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health then a doctor will be working as an engineer and serve the society.
Being a lawyer, he would have been trying to justify anyone.
Our society recognizes, honours and proud of such daughters.
Their honour programmes will be held across the country.
Encouraging India's Lakshmi means to guide the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said earlier that one of the greatest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I have the privilege of interacting directly with many unknown people.
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the result of my test came, some people asked me to read that exam Warriors book
I didn't read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it two-three times.
My experience in this regard was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before exam, I would have got a lot of benefit.
My little student friend, thank you for writing this letter first.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
If you have said that I can take time for new recurrence then I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me your experiences about the aspects related to stress-free tests.
So I'll wait for your ideas.
I once again express my gratitude to our younger friend, student Ali Tayang of Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through TV, through newspapers.
But you know that I am also a common man like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and that is why the effect that affects in a normal life is also on my mind because I have also come from amongst you .
Just a while ago, he had come to the final from Rafael Nadal, the winner of the Grand Salem and the legend of Tennis.
The visitors welcomed his speeches.
Even after the defeat in difficult challenges, he lauded his rival Nadal and gave him the livelihood of the player.
However, on the other hand, the winners also lauded Daniel's game.
The humility and humility of the winners in one match was both worth seeing.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medicine then I will tell you all, especially the youth, that you must see this video.
The ideals of our ancestors are really commendable.
We are said in the scriptures: i.e., when the right and humility in a person is simultaneously accompanied then cannot he win the heart of a person
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to do is directly for your good.
The debate will continue, the party will continue to run, but if some things are stopped before the increase then it will be very beneficial.
The things that increase a lot, it is very difficult to stop it later.
But if we first get awakened and stop it then a lot can be saved.
My mind says that with this feeling, I will definitely talk to young friends especially today.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to leave its addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to people who eat tobacco.
Everybody says this.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to nicotine present in it .
Its consumption in childhood also affects the development of brain .
But today, I want to talk to you on a new subject.
You must be aware that recently e-cigarettes have been banned in India.
E-cigarette is a variety of electronic devices different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarettes, a kind of chemical smoke is grown by heating nicotine liquid substances, through which nicotine is consumed.
We understand the risk of common cigarettes very well, but a misunderstanding about e-cigarettes has been created.
There has been an error that there is no risk from e-cigarettes.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, aromatic chemicals were obtained for not spreading it.
We have seen nearby that even if the father is a smoker, he stops smoking the rest of the house and wants his children not to have a habit of smoking cigarettes.
They have such efforts that no member of the family smokes or smokes.
He knows that smoking causes heavy losses to the body.
Pinars also know and visitors also know.
However, the issue of e-cigarette is very different.
There is no awareness about e-cigarettes.
He is also very unaware of its risks and sometimes e-cigarettes enter the house quietly and sometimes showing miracles and also showing children to each other.
Look, I smoke out of my mouth, see, without fire, without brightness, I smoke.
Once the youngsters and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches then gradually they become intoxicated and they become victims of bad addiction.
In fact, e-cigarettes have many harmful chemicals which have a bad impact on health.
You know that when someone smokes around us then we get to know about it with smell .
Even if there is a cigarette packet in his skull then it is known by the smell.
However, there is no such thing with e-cigarettes. In such a situation, many youngsters and youngsters are unknowingly and in the form of fashion statements, in their own books, in their offices, in their crises, and sometimes in their hands, and they become victims of it.
Young generations are the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that this new way of intoxication cannot neutralize our young country.
Don't cover the dreams of every family, the life of the children will not be bad.
This disease cannot be accumulated in the society.
I urge you to leave the drunken substances of tobacco and do not make any mistakes regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us together build a healthy India.
All of them have to be saved for fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for all of us that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of such extraordinary people who have dedicated their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
This is our Bharat Mata, our country is a multi-dimensional settlement.
Many human beings emerge from this land.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people.
And these are those people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves, but for others.
This is how a great discourse is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the pop will declare Mary Treasury on October 13.
The work done by Sister Mary Treasy for the welfare of humanity in his 50-year-old life is an example for the whole world.
Whatever work was done by Sister Treasury, it was fulfilled with dedication and dedication.
Those who are still moving forward their vision and mission.
Once again, I pay homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic.
Today, the eyes of all countries are on India, seeing the way India has led the entire world in the direction of environment protection.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on October 2.
People are contributing to this campaign as their own.
But a young man of our country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I took care of this work, I tried to understand this new experiment by talking to them on the phone.
It may be that these things can be used for other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudan Belvi ji is making a good effort.
When I heard the word plugging for the first time, it was also new for me.
Perhaps those words have been used in some quantity abroad.
But in India, Ripudan Belviji has propagated it a lot.
Friends, This time the Ministry of Sports is also going to organise a Fit India Planning Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
How to do this programme, what happens in the programme, we have heard of the experience of Ripudan ji.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take a step in this direction, our India will move 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, Thank you very much.
I want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
I wish to remember one thing quickly.
However, I will surely do it in the next Mann Ki Baat but today I am telling you just before so that you can get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that on October 31, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary.
We are going to run in lakhs of villages of India on that day for the unity of the country.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to 15 places in India.
If there are at least 15 places and they can also become then make a program to stay for one night and two nights.
You see, understand and experience India.
We have so many varieties and when the days of holiday come on this Deepavali festival, people must go and therefore I would urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
And how much is this reform, where am I to you
You must be happy that today our rank is 34 and five years ago our rank was 65th, so in a way we have made a big jump.
If we try harder, we will make our place in the world's leading places in tourism till 5 years of independence.
Yes, you must also see that there is no harm to any person because of the fireworks etc. on the day of Diwali.
You must keep the caution that should be taken for it.
There should also be happiness, joy, enthusiasm, and our festivals also bring the fragrance of community and the culture of community.
Community life gives a new strength and this is a monastery of new capabilities.
Let us celebrate festivals with enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolves.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November, 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the child friends of Karnataka.
The victory of the Times Group, Karnataka, finally urged Baldi to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then he published some of these selected letters.
I read those letters, I liked it very well.
These small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on several topics, the Kirti Hegde of North Canada, by describing the Digital India and the Smart City Scheme, have suggested that we need to change our education system.
And if we are aware of the nature of the children then perhaps it can help us move forward in protecting the environment.
Rida Nadaf has written from Lakshadweep that she is the daughter of a soldier.
He said that because of the distant school, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a nearby school.
It was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
In 14th today, the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And when we read those discussions, we are proud of what is the idea of life dedicated to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard they might have worked to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
And that too when the country was getting free from the clutches of slavery.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India keeping in mind the ideas of these great men.
Our Constitution is very wide.
Perhaps there is no field of life, there is no such subject of nature that he has not touched.
Equality and sensitivity towards everyone is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, whether poor or vulnerable, backward or deprived, tribal, women.
And keeps their interests safe.
It is our duty to fulfil the Constitution.
Be it citizens or administrators should move forward in accordance with the spirit of constitution.
Seventy different committees were constituted in the Constituent Assembly on important issues.
It was one of the most important committees, and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, Babasaheb Ambedkar's skilled leadership is in the construction of the Constitution which we feel proud of.
He ensured that every section of society is well-being.
On the 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana Day, we salute him by remembering him as Kayam.
Babasahebs contribution to making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the 15th December.
Sardar Patel, the iron man of the country, had worked extraordinaryly to build the country.
Sardar Sahib was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Adviser Committee for fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day, but on 26-11th New Year the terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget it
This country can never forget his sacrifices.
Today, if terrorism is seen in every part of the world in a way, it has become a terrible form of every day-to-day event.
We have been suffering a lot in India for the last 40 years due to terrorism.
There were many people from all over the world who were not ready to take it seriously, but today, when terrorism is roaming around their rocks, every government of the world is looking at terrorism as a major challenge in the form of humanitarianism, the governments trusted in democracy.
Terrorism has led to the challenge of humanity in the world.
Terrorism has led to humanism.
He is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but also all the humanitarian forces in the world have to defeat terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, are the stones of this land which have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism weaken our social tensions and make nefarious efforts to distinguish them.
And that is why it is the demand of this time to be more aware of humanitarian forces.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we will celebrate all the Navy Day-Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects and protects our coastal areas.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our civilization is beside the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and sea economic and strategic are important for both.
It is our entrance for the entire world.
This country and our land have had an unprecedented relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, the Chaulnavi-Cholnaukal was considered to be one of the most powerful ships during the Chaul dynasty eight hundred and nine hundred years ago.
In the extension of the Chaul Empire, he was a very big part of his ship in making it the economic power of that time.
Several liberals are found in Sangam literature of Chaul Navi's humor and search journeys.
Very few people would know that women were permitted to warships for a long time in most of the ships in the world.
However, in Chaulnaukadal and that too eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, women had played an important role in a large number and even women were involved in fighting.
Chaul rulers had a very prosperous knowledge of building ships.
When we talk about the ship, who can forget the capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the ship.
The beaches of Konkan, where the beaches are very important, came under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Fort , Murud Janjira , Golden Durg etc . were either on the coast or were surrounded by the sea .
The Maratha Navy was responsible for protecting these forts.
The Marathi naval ships were accompanied by large ships and small boats.
Their naval personnel were very skilled in attacking and avoiding any enemies.
And when we talk about the Maratha Navy, how can it be possible to remember Kanoji Angre.
He delivered the Maratha boat to a new height and set up a place of soldiers of the Maratha boat at several places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its valour at different times.
Whether it is the freedom struggle of Goa or 11th India-Pakistan war.
In May-June this year, even when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
In Bangladesh, in the last September, our ship INS horizon also provided humanitarian support to Rohingya.
In the month of June, when the Papua-Nugini government had sent us messages of strength and urged them to save the fishermen of their fishermen boats, our boats helped us.
On 21st May, our naval ship had also reached the INS Trikund to assist a trader ship in the West Akhara to be released from the clutches.
Our vessel has always been proud to provide healthcare to the island of Fiji, to provide immediate relief to the neighbouring country.
We are always proud and proud of our defence forces, be it landlords, ships or airplanes, every countrymen salute the courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
Hence, the people of 1. 25 crore countrymen can live the life of Sukhchen and hence they sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year, we celebrate 7th December as the Flag of the Armed Forces.
This is the day to honour and honour the Armed Forces of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to conduct a campaign from 1st to 7th December, to reach out to the citizens of the country and to make people aware of the armed forces.
All these flags will be placed on the chest throughout the week.
A movement of honour for the Army will begin in the country.
On this occasion, we can also distribute the flag of the armed forces.
Whatever armed forces are associated with their familiarity in their surroundings, they can post their brave steps with video and photographs attached to them to the Carmed Forcesflagday.
In schools, in colleges, by calling the soldiers of the army, you can get information about the army from them.
Our new generation can be a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This celebration also provides an opportunity to gather funds for the welfare of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This fund is spent by the Army Welfare Board on their rehabilitation for the welfare of the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war.
Let us also do something on this occasion, so that the strength of our armed forces increases.
We also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the whole grain is connected to the soil.
If we don't have land or leave, then how can human life be possible
It was perhaps the reason for this thing that we have been aware of the importance of our land in our culture a long time ago from where the organisms were possible.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a comfortable effort to live towards the fields, towards the soil, devotion and respect among the people, while on the other hand scientific methods of nurturing this land are part of our lives.
Both the issues have been important in the lives of the farmers of this country in which the devotion towards their land and also the protection of the land in scientific manner.
I heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use half-hearted chemical fertilizers and fertilizer earlier and this led to the deterioration of their land.
The production of land was slowly decreasing and resulting in reduction in income.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and after that they inspected their land from time to time. They asked them to use fertilizers, fertilizers, micro nutrients and lively fertilizers.
You will also be surprised to hear the results that what was the result of keeping the guidance that the farmers got through the health of the land and the guidance they received
The production of wheat has increased three-four times a day in the season of 2016-17 to these farmers.
Our farmers across the country have made more than 10 crore soil healthcare cards so that they can understand their land more well and live their crops.
We worship the mother of the earth but how much harm do we cause the health of the mother of the earth due to chemical fertilizer like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that giving more urea to the mother of the earth is severely damaged.
This is the need of todays time to revive the relationship of this mother-daughter.
Can our farmers, our soil sons and the saints of our land enjoy the use of urea as they use today, will it be half the use when it will be 5 years of independence in 2022
How a change starts in the lives of the farmer
We have started feeling global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the winter started before Deepavali.
Today, December 12 is screaming and the winter is increasing gradually.
But as the winter begins, we all feel that it does not feel good to get out of the royalty.
But in such a season, how can people who are constantly awakened bring beautiful results and these examples are inspiring for all of us.
This small child Tushar has done inspirational work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
He shows that cleanliness has no age or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an old man, a woman or a man, cleanliness is important for everyone.
And everybody needs to coincidence for cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are committed.
We can learn something at the moment.
Today, he is doing well in every field.
Whether it is the field of sports or any competition or any social initiative, our Divyangjan is not behind anybody.
You must be remembered that our Divyang players had won four medals in the Rio Olympics and also made champions in the Blind Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
Several competitions are being organized across the country.
A few days ago, the 1st National Parasviming Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won the Gold in the 0th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 Paralmix Competition.
32, is one of the Para-Tarnavis who will be trained in the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the passion of brother Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being given on the ease of use and opportunities for Divyangjans.
Our efforts are to empower every person of the country.
An inclusive society grows in harmony with the spirit of equality and mother and moves forward together.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Id gives us a new inspiration to enhance peace and harmony in society.
Forget sorrow, don't forget happiness.
I think we should publish this thing.
We are trying to recall many interesting incidents of the past year in the media.
Can you contribute in this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Recall such inspirational occasions to others.
If we remember good things, the feeling of doing good will be awakened and the mood will be created.
Good things give energy to do good.
And I will try to reach out to the countrymen in the next Mann Ki Baat on your healthcare positive India.
My dear countrymen, will come back to you for the next month's Mann Ki Baat.
There will be a lot of opportunity to talk.
All India Radio on 2nd October, 2019
Six days after Deepavali, Chhath, celebrated in our country, is one of the most regulated and devoted festivals.
In which traditional rules are followed from food habits to weavers.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely associated with nature and the satisfaction of nature .
The sun and water, the Mahaparva are at the centre of the worship of Chhath, the utensils and utensils made of bamboo and mud are integral materials related to its worship system.
On this occasion, the message of the worship of the rising sun and the setting up of the sun is full of unparalleled culture.
This festival also has an important expression of cleanliness in our lives.
Before sixteenth time, the entire house is cleaned, along with rivers, lakes, ponds, shores, pujas, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Ordinarily, people do not think of asking for anything, but in Chhath Puja there is a special tradition of eating by asking Prasad after midnight.
It has also been recognised behind this tradition of asking for prasad that it destroys ego.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be praised.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat is tied up with the people of this country.
Take examples of fertilizer and handicraft.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been working for handloom, for Khadi and what is the result of this.
You might have been happy to hear that such a large sale of fertilizer and handloom is being done on one store.
The sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation during Diwali has increased by about 680.
The total sale of fertilizers and handicrafts has shown an increase of about 0 percent this year over the last year.
This shows that today, youngsters, elderly, women, all age groups like Khadi and handlooms.
I can imagine that this would have benefitted many married families, poor families and families working on handlooms.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, handicrafts have become a powerful instrument to empower them by bringing about changes in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role in the rural areas.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwad has also written on the Narendra Modi App, why can there be arrangements to reach our homes to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweets of our house should reach the people of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepavali with great joy.
Deepawali has brought me a special experience this time too.
Once again, I got the privilege of celebrating Diwali with our people's security forces on the border.
This time, it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every citizen of our security forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces protect the country by tackling the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Wherever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, the experience of our youth should be heard and their pride should be heard.
Many of us don't know that our security forces are playing a vital role in establishing peace not only on our border but also on the world.
As a UN peacekeeper, he is brightening the name of India in the world.
Recently, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everybody recalls the efforts of the UN to establish peace in the world and its positive role.
And we consider the Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
And this belief has led to active partnership in various important initiatives of the UN since the beginning.
You must be aware that both the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begin with words 'WE the PEOPLE'.
India has always stressed on women's equality and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is its livelihood.
What was proposed in its first phase was, 'All men are free and equivalent' which was changed by the efforts of the representative of India, and later accepted, 'All human bengs are open free and equivalent'.
Though this is a very small change but a healthy idea is seen in it.
Your mother will have many people who have been receiving this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have provided their services in the UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONs.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with the UN PEACEEPING ITIVES and this is the third largest data in the world.
By August 2019, Indian soldiers have provided their services to nearly 50 Operators from one PECEEPING Operating Operators across the world.
These operations run in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kong, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many countries across the world.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and innumerable people have been rescued in the hospital of Indian Army in Kong and South Sudan.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by making people free operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in establishing peace.
Very few people would know that India was the first country to send the Female Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Mission in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has become an inspiration for countries around the world.
And then all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only limited to the Peacekeeping Operators but India also works to teach the peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have delivered a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
We have to stay among different people.
Different situations and different cultures have to be understood.
They have to descend as per the local requirements and environment.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper who was honoured with Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji, is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who have raised a special identity in Cyprus.
At the age of 2 in 18, he was made a Force Commander for Operating in Namibia and provided his services to ensure the freedom of the country.
He led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and reiterated his inclusiveness for peacekeeping.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a peace angel.
We believe that everybody lives with peace, harmony and moves towards building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our myth is decorated with great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sisters, whom we call Bhagwani's requests, were also one of those extraordinary people.
He was born as Market Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him a verbal name.
And the meaning of the presentation is that which is fully dedicated.
He later proved himself as per his name.
Tomorrow was the 150th birth anniversary of the Citizens.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister's statement was very sad about the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only made our country a slave but they also tried to make us mentally slaves.
This work continued to showcase our culture and create a sense of insecurity in us.
Bhagwani exhortation reiterated the pride of Indian culture.
Awareness of national consciousness, he worked to unite people.
He went to different countries of the world and raised voice against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem 'Pudumi Penna', New Women and Women Empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was the inspiration of the Lord.
Bhagwani exhorted the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped in publishing and propagating bus research through his writings and conferences.
This is the special beauty of India that spirituality and science are supplementary in our culture.
It is a strong example of Bhagwani's presentation and scientific Jagadish Chandra Basu.
In 18th Calcutta, a horrific plague occurred and hundreds of people were killed in the surveillance.
Without worrying about his health, Bhagwan's enlightenment started the work of cleaning the streets and streets.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life but she was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifices, people looked at him in service work.
He congratulated the people on the importance of cleanliness and service through their work.
And it is written on his tomb - 'Here Reposes Sister Navedita, who has given her all to India', is resting here in the emotions of God who dedicated her to India.
Undoubtedly he did the same.
Today, for this great personality, he cannot have any more right tribute than that that every Indian should try to walk on the path of service by taking inspiration from his life.
First of all, on the birth anniversary of our first elder Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, I extend my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day.
Children are the most important heroes of New India- Nayak.
Your concern is true that the diseases that used to occur in old age, the last phase of life had come closer.
Today it is very amazing when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes .
Such diseases used to happen in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders .
A major reason for this kind of disease in youth is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and family need to focus on this.
When they think about it, you will see that there is no need to distinguish anything.
Just need to change your habits and make it a habit.
I would like the family members to take the habit of going to the open field.
If possible, we should also play with the elders of the family by going to open with these children.
Instead of coming up in the lift the child habit of climbing the stairs .
After dinner the whole family walks a little with the children .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga, especially our young friends, will help in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorders.
30 minutes of Yoga before going to school, see how much benefits are there.
You can also do at home and the specialty of Yoga is that it is easy, easy and accessible and I am easily telling you that any adult person can do it easily.
Several researches are being done to know how effective Yoga is in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have come up so far are very encouraging.
We should not only make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives, but also through treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons have brightened the name of our country in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won the Asia Cup Hockey by playing a glorious game.
Our sportspersons have performed excellently and India has become Asia Cup Champion after ten years.
Earlier, India became Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in Badminton.
Badmint Star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open by performing excellent performances and has glorified the pride of every Indian.
This is the third super-series premiere of the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for their achievements and for enhancing India's pride.
Friends, FIFA-1 World Cup was organized this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their contribution to the field of football.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons were very excited.
The whole world is watching you...
Such a big match... I was shocked to see the energy, enthusiasm and feelings of all the young players.
The World Cup was successfully organised and all teams performed their best.
Though India could not win the sportsperson, India's young sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
The entire world, including India, celebrated this festival of sports and this entire competition was interesting and entertaining to football lovers.
The future of football is very bright and its signs are visible.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, as many people as I write about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of justifying with their feelings, I will have to do the Mann Ki Baat programme every day and I have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on sanitation.
Somebody sends the footsteps of the efforts of the wrongdoers and somewhere there is a story of the collective efforts of the youth.
Somewhere there is talk of innovation about cleanliness or there is news of the changes in the people of an officer.
In the last days, I have received a very detailed report in which one thing is the rejuvenation of the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
At the same time, a team of NGOs, called Ecological Protection Organisation, will carry out the campaign for the sanitation of Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me the explanations of the fort before and after cleanliness.
I was shocked to see the footsteps and whoever sees these photographs, he feels disappointed even after seeing the dirt around him, and sometimes he feels that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled, then I will tell him that you can see the youth of the Ecological Protective Organization, their sweat and their sweat and their commitment in the vibrant tests.
Your disappointment will be turned into confidence when you see it.
This Bhagirath effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, community and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Our fellow countrymen have the responsibility of protecting and cleaning historical heritage.
I congratulate the Ecological Protective Organization and its entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate all the Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and described all species as equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and women's honor.
Guru Nanak Devji traveled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his visit, he gave a message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and commitment.
He gave a message of equality in society and showed his message not only with words, but with his work.
He launched an anchor that led to the creation of service among the people.
Sitting together, awakening the feeling of unity and equality among the people.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - the name of the soul, work, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Devji had also constructed Gurbani to speak to him.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us move forward on the path of his message and teaching.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on October 31, we will celebrate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji's birth anniversary.
We all know that he had laid the foundation stone of modern Akhara India.
Today, we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On October 31, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only used to think about changes, but he was also expert in finding out a very complex problem in dealing with it.
He was in the forefront of realizing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the drive to tie India in a drive.
He ensured that millions of Indians be brought to the bottom of a nation and a Constitution.
Their decision-making capability enabled them to cross all obstacles.
Wherever there was a need for recognition, he reiterated his recognition where there was a need to use force.
He said that we cannot prevent any discrimination of caste and religion, all are daughters and daughters of India, all of us should love our country and build our policy on mutual love and goodwill.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant to our vision of New India.
And this is the reason that his birth anniversary is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution to the nation as an integral nation is indefinite.
On the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, on 31st October, 'Run for Unity' will be organized across the country, including children, youth, women, all age groups from across the country.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of mutual goodwill, Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Deepavali, with a new resolve, with a new determination, you have once again joined your daily life.
My dear countrymen, greetings to your brothers.
Three years have been completed by Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani and today it is 36 MO APSOD.
And when people from every corner of the country reach me what I tell you in Mann Ki Baat, I might tell you very little, but I get a lot of money.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Most of them are for reforms in the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attention is drawn towards community problems.
And I take half an hour of yours once a month but people reach their point on the third day of Mann Ki Baat.
And the result was that even in the government, there is a feeling of sensitivity and sensitivity in the far-flung society.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time, I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man.
And I am confident that this ideal will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future. It will provide a new consciousness and new energy.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should worry about the need that we should take it as much as we need while eating.
But after that I have seen that I have received so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organisations and many youths have already been doing this.
Several people who worked on how to use the food plate which is left in the plate have come to me so that I am very happy and happy.
And then I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie with Dugter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I spoke to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, not only in India but also in the whole world, a massive campaign of selfie with daughter has been launched.
This is not just the issue of social media.
This event was a new confidence and a new pride in every girl.
Every parents felt that I should also take selfies with my daughter.
Every girl started feeling that I have some importance, I have some importance.
In the past, I was sitting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
Whenever I told the people going to the tour that wherever you go, send a photograph on Incredible India.
Millions of people from every corner of India, in a way, have become a big intent for those working in the field of tourism.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have experienced how big adventurous movements start from the smallest of us.
Today, I am happy to say all these things because when I was thinking that it was three years ago, many incidents of the last three years were left in my mind.
The country is constantly moving towards the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the welfare of others, for the betterment of society and for the progress of the country, I have learnt from the countrymen in the Mann Ki Baat campaign of three years.
It is a huge capital for any country, it has a very big strength.
I salute the countrymen with my heart.
Whether it is a roof or a towel or a curtain, the experience has been that the attraction of fertilizer has increased in the youth generation.
The sale of fertilizer has increased and this has led to direct employment in the houses of the poor.
Discount is given in Khadi from 2nd October, many are released.
Once again, I would like to urge you to move forward and enhance the campaign of Khadi.
We should work with the spirit of buying fertilizer and illuminating Diwali at the house of the poor.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to the increase in interest in this mine, there has been an increase in the enthusiasm to think about the mines in the field of mines and in the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase production capacity, how to bring solar capacity
How can it be revived that the old heritage which had been completely closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years, but today it has been revived.
Several activities have been added.
New employment opportunities have been created to many people.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed its closed training center and Kashmir has a lot to give in this area.
Now due to the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will get help in building modernization, making new things and I am very happy that when the big corporate houses also offer gifts to Deepawali then they have started giving mines.
People have also started giving food items as gifts to each other.
We all feel how things move forward with a comfortable sense.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we all made a pledge and we decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti, I will celebrate Swachhta across the country.
I will connect people and people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this work and the country was connected.
Whether it is a male or female, a city or a village, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
And when I say, 'Sankalp to Siddhi', this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving towards a visionary achievement, we are looking at it before our eyes.
Everybody accepts it, supports it and somebody contributes to fulfilling it.
This time, one thing is that we should make cleanliness somewhere, the other is that we should not make dirt by being aware, but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also important.
This time many competitions have been organized with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Thousands of children have made pictures.
As far as cleanliness comes, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see how much of our country's electronic media can serve, how much of our country's prime media can do, in the Swachhata same service movement.
Just a few days ago, somebody had paid attention to the 18-year-old youth of Srinagar, Bill Dar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar City Corporation has created its Brand Ambassador for the sanitation and when it comes to the matter of Brand Ambassador then you will feel that it will be a cinematographer, perhaps it will be a hero of the game or not.
Bill Dar has been engaged in cleanliness since the age of 12-13 years since last 5-6 years.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, where it is plastic, polythene, used bottle, waste, it is cleaning.
They also earn some of them.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age, but he also joined his life with cleanliness.
I would also like to congratulate the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for their initiative towards cleanliness and their vision of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and it is a matter of great strength for cleanliness.
And I am glad that they have not only made the bill a brand ambassador, but they have given the bill this time the corporation has given a car, analysis and they are also going to other areas and teaching people for cleanliness, inspiring them and following the results.
Bill Dar is a young age but is an inspiration for everyone interested in hygiene.
The month of October is the month of remembering many great men for us.
These dignitaries guided us for the 20th century and the 21st century, led us, guided us and he suffered a lot for the country.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji is on 11th October, the birth anniversary of Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji on 25th September.
Nanaji and Deendayal ji are also the centenary year.
And what was the centre of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not merely a teaching, to guide people through his conduct in his life.
Gandhi ji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji are all such great men who are away from the thresholds of power but continue to live with the lives of the people and continue to do something or the other.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left the political life in the village and when we are celebrating his centenary year today, it is very natural to have respect for his village work.
When former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam ji used to talk to the youth, Nanaji always talked about the rural development of Deshmukh.
He used to mention with great respect and he himself went to the village to see this work of Nanaji.
It is not a bounty to remember all these great men. I remember these great men so that we continue to get the way forward.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely say about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the run for unity 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat' programme will be organized across the country.
There should be a massive run-for unity programme in every city and every city of the country and this season is also enjoying running and it is also important to get iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move forward the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say very naturally - unity in diversity, specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to realize this diversity
I will tell my countrymen of India again and again and especially to my younger generation, I have to say that we are in a state of awakening.
This feels the diversity of India, touches them, feels their fragrance.
You see, this diversity of our country also works as a very big school for the development of your personality.
Week is the day of Deepavali, there is a habit of going around somewhere in our country, people become travellers and they are very natural.
But sometimes we are worried that we don't see our country, don't understand the diversity of the country, but we have started selecting foreign tours after coming under the influence of shock.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any bonds but sometimes see your house.
The person of North India does not know what is in South India
The people of western India don't know what is in East India
Our country is full of so many diversities.
All these great men visited India in detail.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
India tried to live within itself.
Can we try to teach different states of our country, different communities, groups, their customs, their traditions, their dress, their food habits and their beliefs as a student
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we are not only visiting but also trying to contribute to them as a student.
I have my experience that I must have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India.
There will be more than four and a half districts where I have got the opportunity to travel and today when I am taking over this responsibility in India, I have the experience of visiting this place.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to feel the storage of our large India's incomplete strength while speaking the message of unity in diversity.
The dream of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat' is one of them.
How many varieties of food habits are there.
Even if the whole life continues to eat a different meal everyday then no meal will be repeated.
This is a great strength of our tourism.
Inspire the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
This experience will make your life prosperous.
The variety of your thoughts will be broad.
And who can be a greater teacher than experience
Normally the period from October to March is mostly of tourism .
People go on a tour.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will move ahead with my campaign.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share your views.
You must send your pictures on Incredible India.
If you want to meet not only the buildings but also the people there then also send photographs of them.
Learn not only about natural beauty but also about the life of the people there.
Write a good deal of your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about that
If you see, if all the people of one state say this then I will say in the government that it should be fulfilled and it should be published on the seven common things that have come about every state.
I mean, in a way, how to encourage tourist destinations from the spirit of people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also play an encouraging role in enhancing the tourism of the country from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, many things touch me as a human.
I invite my heart.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
Finally, I am also a man like you.
We have seen a unique example of womens strength and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has grown in this young age then how will their mind be .
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dreams of his wife.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubey's wife Makesh Dubey used to work as a hero in the army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided in the mind and she also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to have respect for these brave people, on our mother power.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
He is a new inspiration, a new consciousness for the Koti-Koti people of the country.
Congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country between the festival of Navratri and Diwali.
We are organizing the World Cup of FIFA Under 1.
I am sure football will be left all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school and college field in India where our youngsters do not see the game.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the whole world is coming to play on the earth of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
Mother Durga is an opportunity to worship.
The entire environment is covered with sacred fragrance.
All around, there is an atmosphere of spirituality, the atmosphere of festival, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is celebrated as a festival of energy.
It is known as Sharadi Navratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to mother Shakti to achieve new heights to fulfill the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country is capable of dealing with every challenge.
The country is moving forward at a rapid pace and when 75 years of Indias independence is being completed in 2022, then the efforts to fulfil the dreams of those people who have been living for freedom should be the vision of those 1.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals also enhance enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat August 2019
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand whenever there is information about violence from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to be worried.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, which has given full strength to the unity of the country.
Over centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence, equal respect and have been in our grip.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have heard it from childhood.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, whether it is communal beliefs or beliefs in political ideals, whether it is faithful or believing in that tradition.
There is a system of justice for every person in the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us.
I would like to assure the people of the country, those who take the laws, those who have suppressed the hope of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, the law will determine the responsibility and will continue to punish the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to eating, living and wearing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and because of our thousands of years old cultural heritage, we need cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, we might have survived for 365 days, which we are not connected to any festival.
It may have been noted that every festival of ours is followed by the timelines of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our money festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today, if I am talking about the festivals then first of all I want to call you Mitchami Dukdam.
The festival of Samvatsari was celebrated tomorrow in the Jain society.
Parushan Parv is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in the Jain society.
The last day of the Purushan Parv is on the occasion of Santhasari.
This is really a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Samvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is also known as a forgiveness festival and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a Michami Dukdam.
In his drama The Merchant of Venice, Sensitivity has written, "Mercy is two blasts, it blesses him that gives and those things, that is, those who forgive and those who are forgotten, get the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and he became a symbol of freedom movement 125 years ago.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days.
This great festival is called a symbol of unity, equality and austerity.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to every countrymen.
The festival of Onam is now being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the diverse festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
Onam festival demonstrates the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival provides a message of love and harmony in society and creates a new spirit, a new hope and a new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the reason for tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think about what we can do in this direction.
A few days later, the festival of Id-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country in the category of these festivals.
I extend my best wishes to every countrymen.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us, but we also have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are integrated in family life.
Cleanliness is the belief of the preparation of festivals.
It is not a new thing for us, but it is also important to make it a social nature.
Cleanliness should be an integral part of this festival not only in the house but also in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernization are changing.
Now a new dimension, a new perameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how long your small process is, it is also being used to know how long it is and how aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it, then it is considered bad in the society today.
And the result of this is that today I see that even during the Ganesha Festival, eco-friendly Ganesha, as if a big campaign has emerged.
If you look at your youth then the children are making Ganesh ji in every house and bringing the soil and making Ganesh ji.
Various types of experiments are being done in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Environment Consciousness was seen in this Ganesha Festival that had been seen before.
Media Houses are also teaching people, inspiring and guiding people for the statues of Ganesha in large numbers.
And as I said, our country is full of millions of bright minds.
And it feels very good when some innovations come to know.
Someone told me that there is a man who is an engineer himself, he has collected soil in a specific way and is training people to make Ganesh ji by combining it.
And if Ganesha is immersed in the water then he takes water in a dollar so that it melts immediately in the water.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will be completed three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached around 3 to 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free.
A few days ago, there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water decreased after the floods, so much dirt spread everywhere.
At the same time, workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques.
Everyone swept out.
Each worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind gave an example of unity, inspiring everyone.
Where can our country reach if it becomes a sustainable nature of dedication and dedication for cleanliness
Wherever we get the opportunity, we can find the opportunity.
But we are all connected.
Work together on the day of holiday or on Sunday.
Go to the neighbourhood of the neighborhood, go to the neighbourhood, but do it as a movement.
A section has been set up on this line where after the construction of toilets, you can enter your name and the name of that family which has helped in providing it.
My friends from social media can run a constructive drive and the work discussed in the Virtual World can be a great inspiration.
This campaign of Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation from Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi is a banquet competition for you, a competition to make short films, a competition of paintings is being organized.
You can write in different languages and there is no limit of age, no age-limit.
You can make a short film, you can make your mobile.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be in any language, it can also be sylent.
The best three of them will be elected, three will be on the District Level, three on the State Level.
So I invite all of you to join you in this mission of cleanliness.
Once again, I would like to say that this time, on October 2, to celebrate Gandhi Jayanti as October 2, and for this, the Swachhta should not reach the same service mantra from 15th September.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Be a participant by working on yourself.
You see, how will this October 2 of Gandhi Jayanti be bright.
You can imagine how a sacred joy will be in us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day cleanliness drive.
My dear countrymen, I specially want to accept your credit.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depths of my heart, that is, for such a long time, you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat but I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation because lakhs of people from every corner of the country are connected with this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people write to me sometimes, sometimes sends messages, sometimes there is a message on the phone, which is a very big source for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
Besides, I look forward to your messages as much as you want to hear Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't think we do wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He is always trying to help the people but I am worried about one of his habits.
I went to mall once to shop with him.
He comfortably spent Rs. 2000 for a sari and Rs. 450 for Pinja and the auto-rickshaw taken to Mall for a long period of five rupees.
While returning, they bought vegetables from the road and saved four-five rupees by repaying them on every vegetable.
I felt very bad.
We pay large bills without asking each other and fight for a few rupees with the brothers and sisters living in our labour.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, there is a ferry applicant, a small shopkeeper or a seller or a autorickshaw person, whenever we come in contact with the people living in a hard work, we start swinging emotions with him - not only less than two rupees, less than five rupees.
And whenever we are going to eat in a big restaurant, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and we have to take out the money immediately.
Not only this, even if you want to buy saris in the Showroom, we don't pay any respect but we cannot live without paying any respect to any poor.
We have ever thought of what happens in the minds of the poor
The question is not of two or five rupees. His heart feels sad that you are poor and that is why he doubted his honesty.
There is no difference in your life with two-five rupees, but this small habit of yours will have had a deep impact on his mind.
Madam, I am grateful to you, I have given you a message by calling such phones that you touch the heart.
I am confident that if my countrymen have a habit of behaving with the poor then they will definitely leave.
My dear young friends, on 2nd August, the entire country celebrates as National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I recall this thing because I want the new generation of our country to join sports.
Sports is a part of our lives.
If we are counted among the youngest countries of the world, then our youth should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports i . . physical fitness , mental ultrasons , personality enhancing , I understand what should be more than this .
In a way, sports is a very large herb of heart fairs.
Today, in the computer age, I also want to warn that the playing field is more important than that of that place.
FIFA play on computer, but also in the field outside, sometimes interact with football.
Crickets are playing on computers, but the joy of playing cricket below the sky in the open field is somewhat different.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out, the mother used to ask for the first time when would they come back
Today, the situation is such that as soon as the children come home, cartoon films start appearing in one corner or they get stuck on the mobile game and then the mother has to say that when will you go out
It is a matter of time, it was also a time when the mother used to tell the child that when will you come and today it is a situation that the mother has to say that, son, when will you go out
Youth Friends, The Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent survey portal to explore and reflect talents, where any child who has achieved some achievements in sports sector in the country can upload biodeta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected innovative players.
Let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with this festival of sports, accept sports and create an environment in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share with the people of that country as an event that has touched my mind last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of very young age and some of these daughters were born in the Himalayas.
The courage and courage of the six daughters of our country who have never been associated with the ocean is inspiring us all.
These six daughters will have to cross the sea with a small boat INS Tarini.
The mission has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will roam around the world several months later, after several months.
Sometimes 40-40 days will be spent in water and sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water.
Our six daughters, and this is going to be the first event in the world with courage between the waves of the sea.
Is it a Hindustani who is not proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read everybody in a way because this is an adventurous story, a self-reliant story and I will be happy to deliver the words of those daughters to you.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate the Teachers Day.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birth anniversary.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher for his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
The great scientist, Albert Institution, had said that it is the supreme art of the teacher to take pleasure in creative expedition and quality.
That is, awakening the joy of creative emotions and knowledge among our students is the most important quality of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate the Teacher's Day, can we make a resolution together
And when we talk of change in our country, the way the mother is remembered in the family, the teachers are remembered in the society.
Teachers play a very big role in transformation.
Sometimes there have been incidents in the lives of every teacher that their comfortable effort would have been successful in bringing about changes in the lives of someone.
If we make a collective effort then we will play a very big role in the nations transformation.
Come, let us take this mantra of Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Ananya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai and work for India Research Centre in Howard University.
My dear countrymen, 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana', Financial Incubation, has been a matter of discussion not only in India but in the entire world.
On 28th August, 2014, the campaign was launched with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJJDY) campaign will be held on 28th August tomorrow.
30 crore new families have been linked to it, bank accounts have been opened.
This figure increases even more than the dependence of many countries of the world.
Today, I am very happy that within three years, my poor brothers and sisters sitting on the last end of the society have become part of the root cause of the economy, their habits have changed, they have started living in the bank, they have started saving the money, they are feeling safeguarding the money.
About 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor. This savings are their strengths in the coming days.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefited from insurance.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - one rupee and thirty rupees are a very common prize today.
In many households, because of the insurance of one rupee, the loss of lives of the poor had come to an end. In a few days he got two lakh rupees.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, be it the Dalits, the tribals, the women, the youngsters, the intended to do something on their own, the crores of youth received money from the banks without any guarantee.
Not only this, everyone has also made successful efforts to provide employment to each other.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me, because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, because of insurance, because of the RuPay Card, how the common people have benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and many inspiring things have emerged.
Today, I will definitely tell the people of the bank that MyGov is such a matter.
They can also inspire a new generation by introducing such people.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and environment have a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Ishaan India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural calamities due to the past year.
The flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief work is being done at a wide range.
My colleagues of the Cabinet are also reaching Ruberu wherever possible.
The state governments are also making efforts to help the victims with their own help.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making a lot of efforts to help people in such a situation.
Whether it is the Government of India to go to the army, the air force, the people of the National Disaster Relief Force, the paramilitary forces, all of them are associated with the service of the victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very busy.
NDRF teams have been deployed.
The contract has been made affirmative friends and these disaster friends have been trained to do what to do and what to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and a public organisation has been educated to work in a state of distress.
Gradually, we also make the nature of our activities as per the climate parameters so that we can save ourselves from losses.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time all the letters related to GST have come, so many phone calls have come.
And still people are expressing happiness over GST and also expressing curiosity.
And I also listen to you on a phone call, Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am calling Neetu Garg from Gurgaon.
I have heard the message of your Chartered Accountants Day and have been very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched in our country on the same date last month.
Whether you can say that the results of the government's expectations are being achieved after a month or not
I want to know your ideas about this.
And when a poor man writes a letter to me that GST has reduced the cost of living of the poor, things are cheaper, then I am very happy and happy.
Now I was looking at the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the arrival of trucks has increased.
How is it taking less time to cut the distance
Highways have been freed from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to different taxpayers, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector used to be used to maintain the work and they had to make their new godowns in every state.
However, GST, which I call Good and Simplicity.
It has really had a very positive impact on our economy and has affected in a short time.
The rapid transformation that has come into force, the rapid transformation of each seed has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes, economists, managing experts, technologists, will surely present the world in the form of model researching the use of GST of India.
It will become a case study for many universities in the world.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre unanimously.
And this is the result that every government has a single priority that GST does not have any burden on the plate of the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, central and state governments involved in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective strength.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not only a tax reform but also a new culture of authenticity.
In a way, this is also a social reform campaign.
Once again, I salute the Koti Koti Koti to make such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
We have been listening to this thing since childhood and the reason for this is the 1st August, 120, non-cooperation movement.
August 142, the uit India Movement was launched which is known as August revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th, the country was free.
In a way, in the month of August, many incidents related to the date of independence are particularly linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of uit India movement.
But very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali gave the name of uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
The way the countrymen continued to join you, struggle and tolerate the freedom movement from 1985 to 142, it is our inspiration to build Indias background of history.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
This movement was committed to the entire country to liberate from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian democracy had become a part of the uit India Movement, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the corner of the country, in the form of educated, educated, educated, poor and poor.
People's anger was at its peak.
On the auspicious occasion of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians were embracing their lives in the war with the mantra of Death.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and sacrificed books.
The bugle of freedom had come out after listening.
I August, Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement, but all the big leaders were imprisoned by the British authority.
And that was the time when great men like Dr. Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan had played a leading role in the country as the leader of the second generation.
The Non-cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement shows two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 142.
The nature of the non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 was so different that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of the deaths.
This entire success was the support of the people, the power of the people.
The people were committed, the people were fighting, the whole country was fighting.
Sometimes I think that if we look at the leaves of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1985.
The freedom struggle, which began in 1985, continued in some corner of the country till 142 moments.
This long period has replaced the throne of independence in the hearts of the people of the country.
Everyone has become committed to doing something.
Federations have changed, but there was no shortage of commitment.
The country has been trying its best to break the British empowerment.
From 1985 to 1942, this movement created such a situation that it reached the peak in 1942 and the desert of uit India was blown up in five years that the British had to go to 14 in 1942.
From 1985 to 1942, it reached the people of the country from 142 to 14 years, became such a people who became the reason for the independence of the country as a five-decisive year of success.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this count.
In 14th, we were free, today is 2019.
Nearly 0 years have passed, everybody has made efforts to get rid of the problems of the country, to become systems, to become systems, to develop and to develop.
Just as there was a decisive five years of achievement from 142 to 14 resolutions.
I see that the period of five years from 2019 to 2022 has come to us from the resolution to the achievement.
On 15th August, 2019, we will celebrate as a pledge festival and when 5 years of independence will be held in 2022, we will continue to transform this pledge into achieving.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
As the five years of 1942-14 became decisive for the freedom of the country, these five years can also become decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, I will celebrate 5 years of independence.
Come, let's run a massive campaign of achievement from August to August this month.
Every Indian, social institutions, local units, schools, colleges, different organisations - take some or the other pledge for every New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Today, I am particularly online, because we may be somewhere or not, but we must be online.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends to come forward to contribute innovatively to the creation of a New India.
With the use of technologies, the video, the post, the blog, the graphs, the ideas and the ideas.
Conversion of this humor into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister will also launch the quiet India quiz for young friends on the Narendra Modi App.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must spread and propagate it.
There one person does not speak, the sound of 1. 5 billion people from the Red Fort shouts.
This time also I invite you to send me your thoughts on MY GOV or on the Narendra Modi App.
I read it myself and I will try to demonstrate the time I have on August 15.
In the last three times, I got to hear a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech is slightly long.
Whether the success is achieved or not.
Ladies and gentlemen, I also want to say one thing.
India's economy has a social economy.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just an opportunity to enjoy.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poor and the poor.
A few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesh Festival, afterwards the fourth moon, then Anant Chaudas, Durga Puja, Deepawali, one after another, this is the right time when the poor gets the opportunity of economic gifts.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before the defence bonds, hundreds of households have started making treasures in small household industries.
Thousands of businesses of sheep makers, sheep sellers, sweets are connected to a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs through it.
We illuminate the lamps in Deepavali, not only this, it is a festival, it is a decoration of the house.
Its direct connection is with those poor families who make small soil baskets.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen, and sometimes I think that the people of the country are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, citizens have written letters to me regarding the environment.
He urged you to talk about Eco-Friendly Ganesh in the fourth Ganesh Chaturthi so that people are already planning on the selection of soil Ganesh.
First of all, I am grateful to such awakening citizens.
He has urged me to talk about this matter before time.
This time, public Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji had launched this great tradition and this year is the 125th year of public Ganesh Festival.
Once again, we will hold banquet competitions in this year of Ganesh Festival, hold discussions and recall the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And in the direction of Tilak ji's feelings, how should we take the public Ganesha Festival, and at the same time it should be our commitment to protect the environment at the same time eco-friendly Ganesha and Ganesh made of soil.
And this time I have said very soon
I am sure you will join me everybody and it will benefit from this that the poor workers, poor artists, those who make statues will get employment and the poor will be filled with their stomach.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect with the economy of the poor, enjoy our festivals to become the economic festival of the house of the poor and become economic joy.
I extend my best wishes to every countrymen for several festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the field of education, economic sector, social sector, sports- our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters.
Recently, our daughters have performed a glorious performance in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I was feeling that the World Cup could not win.
He also had pressure on his face and stress.
We have seen many such sportspersons that if Indian players fail in it, the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the boundaries and say something like this, so that there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time when our daughters were unable to succeed in the world, 1. 25 billion Indians took the defeat on their own.
Not only this, the quality of this thing that these girls have done was glorified.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are really doing a lot to illuminate the name of the country.
Once again I congratulate the youth of the country, especially our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again I recall the revolution of August, once again I recall the 15th August, and once again I recall the 5th year of independence, 2022.
Every countrymen should make a five-year roadmap to achieve the commitment of every countrymen.
We all have to take this country to new heights, reach and reach.
Come on, let us continue to do something.
The fate of the country will continue to grow better and move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
The weather has become pleasant in many parts of the country.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief from the heat falling in the cold winds in the last few days.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, any stress, personal life, public life, rains change our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is considered to be a very honourable countrymen in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of Lord Jagannathji's Rath Yatra is celebrated.
And the poor people of the country are connected to Lord Jagannath ji.
Those who are Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar had studied, he might have seen that he had praised Lord Jagannath ji's temple and his traditions because he was under social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannath ji is the god of the poor.
And very few people would know that there is a word in English, Jaggernaut and that means a grand chariot which no one can stop.
It is also seen that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my greetings to every countrymen and salute Lord Jagannath ji.
The diversity of India is also its specialty, the diversity of India is also the strength of India.
The sacred month of Ramzan was celebrated with a sacred spirit.
Now this is the festival of Id.
I extend my best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramadan is the month of Punya Dan.
It is a month of sharing of happiness and as much happiness as we share.
Let us share the joys of being inspired by these sacred festivals and move the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, a motivational event of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me.
Nearly three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live there in small villages, in a way more dependent on the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to make toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, they also get support from the government and approximately Rs. 1 lakh has been given to them.
One lakh rupees will be spent for other facilities in your village.
I congratulate every villager of Mubarakpur for converting this holy occasion of Ramadan into an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One of their things is also very inspirational.
And the biggest thing is that he made Mubarakpur open defecation free.
We know that in our country three regions are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF.
I express my gratitude to the governance, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this work.
We know a lot that if we have to do something good in the life of the person and in the life of the society then we have to work hard.
If our letter is bad, if it has to be improved then it has to be awake for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
The subject of cleanliness is also the same.
Such bad habits have become part of our nature.
It has become a part of our habits.
We have to make constant efforts to get rid of it.
Everybody has to attract attention.
We have to remember good inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the last few days, a very excellent event came in my mind, which I would like to say before you.
This event is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there has taken a big task with the participation of the people.
100 hours of non-stop campaign.
And what was the goal
To make 10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayats in one hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 villages have become ODF.
I convey my best wishes to the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district that they have shown a great inspirational example by reaching out to their hard work.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I continue to get the invitation from the people, Narendra Modi continues to come to the App, MyGov.
It keeps on coming on the lines, it keeps coming from letters, it keeps on coming on the astronomy.
Shriman Prakash Tripathy has recalled the difficulties that he has presented on 25th June as a dark period in the history of democracy.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathy ji is commendable and democracy is not only a system but also a culture.
15, 25 June - It was a dark night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into prison.
The opponent voice was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were shut down in jail.
The justice system could not have survived the shadow of that terrible form of crisis.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Todays journalists, students of the world, those who work in the democracy, recall the dark period, continue to try to increase awareness about democracy and continue to do so.
At that time Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
When it took a year, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described the condition of the time in his poem.
We have to empower this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling proud by lifting his head in the world today.
The entire world became Yoga Day on 21st June, 2019.
People from water to mountain welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
People performed Yoga on the Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level on the World Heritage Site Machu Picchu in Peru.
People performed yoga in French Film Tower.
More than 4000 people performed community yoga in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to be present in the programme of Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing yoga in rains.
Where our soldiers have minus 20, 25, 40 degree temperature, they also performed yoga in Siachen.
Our Armed Forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISFs, everybody has made Yoga their own part with their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share photographs of Yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried forward this thing.
I have received several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that recently we had heard in your statements in Kerala that instead of the gifts and flowers we offer at different places, we should give good reading books as mementos.
You have also started this work during your tenure in Gujarat, but sir, we are not able to see this thing in a few days.
So can we do this
Panekar Foundation is organised and public is celebrated on reading day and reading month to make people aware of book reading habits.
For this, I got the opportunity to visit its launch.
And Khadi's handicrafts, which will also encourage Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of all of us, but after coming here, my habit was lost.
But when he went to Kerala, he recalled once again.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions in the government.
We can gradually create a habit.
And the AYUSH of flowers is very low.
Once we took it in the hands and then put it in the hands.
But if the book is given then it becomes a part of the house and becomes a part of the family.
If we welcome Khadi's towel then how many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this, how historic is the value of such things.
When I went to UK last year, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth, invited me to eat.
How many years have passed, however, the towel given by ueen Elizabeth by Mahatma Gandhi has been saved.
And when I was looking at him, he was insistent on touching me.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life and became part of his history.
I am confident that the habits do not change overnight and when we talk like this, we have to become a victim of hatred.
Even though there will be vaccines, but if I keep talking then gradually changes will also come.
My dear countrymen, because of being the Prime Minister, there are many types of work.
I have to stay in the files but I have a habit of reading some of the letters that I have received, and this gives me an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of letters come and different types of people write letters.
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter and I feel that I must tell you about it.
In far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a householder of Madurai, Arulmoji Saran, he sent me a letter.
And in his letter, he wrote that I thought of doing some economic activity with the help of focusing on the education of children in my family so that the family gets financial support.
So I took money from the bank through the Mudra scheme and brought some goods from the market and started a small work towards sending the supply.
I am aware that the Government of India has undertaken a system called the Government of India e-Marketplace.
So I discovered information about what it was, and asked the people about it.
Then I myself registered it.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get the opportunity, you will also visit the e-GEM on the internet.
Those people who want to send some goods in the government, want to send small things, want to send electricity bulbs, want to send dustbins, want to send silver, want to send tables, sell them, they can register their names in the site.
They can write about the quality of goods they have, how much they will sell, they can write and the people of the departments of the government will have to visit the site, they will have to see that they are not tied to the quality of supply but they are cheaper.
And then they have to order.
Every department of the government has to see those who register their names within the e-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are very cheap.
Now this Aurulmozhi Medame has registered all the goods that could be given on this website of the government.
And the interesting thing is that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got money from Mudra, my business started, I gave all the information about what I can give under e-GEM and what I was asked from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace - GEM.
I would like to say that those people who want to sell their goods to the government are more and more connected to this site.
I believe that this is a wonderful example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance (MSP Governance) and its objective is at least price and more easier efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our legs are on the ground connected with Yoga, then our dreams are to be fulfilled by far-reaching dignity and those aspirations.
A few days ago, India has done a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Two days ago, ISRO launched the 30-NA Satellite with Cartoset-2 series satellite.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America besides India.
And this satellite mission of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the work of farmers and during natural calamities.
A few days ago, we all will remember that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-1.
And the satellite that India has launched so far is the most weighted satellite.
And when the newspapers of our country had compared with the weight of its elephant then you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the field of space.
A thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am glad that our scientists have the power to fulfil the efforts that six months have successfully completed. And now even after a thousand days, our Mangalyaan Mission is working.
The photographs are being sent, information is being given, the sanitary data is coming, it is working more than its age.
The completion of a thousand days is an important stop in our scientific journey and in our space journey.
We are also seeing that the interest of our youth is increasing in the field of sports.
It is now seen that our younger generations are looking at their future in addition to studying and sports and because of their hard work, the name of the country is illuminated due to their achievements.
Recently, India has enhanced the dignity of the country by honouring the Bedminton player Kidambi Srikanth on his victory in Indonesia Open.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
Ushaji's Usha School of Athletics was given the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the synthetic track.
Sportspersons also play a very important role in development.
The importance of sports is very big in the entire personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports even in our family then they should be given an opportunity to play.
They should not be compelled to raise them from the fields, shut down in the rooms, they should not be compelled for books, they can move forward in it, but if they are capable of sports, they should be encouraged, encouraged by school, college, family and surrounding people.
Everybody should serve dreams for now's Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of rains and festivals, in a way, the feeling of this period is new.
We can never forget the heat of this year.
The rainy season is waiting in the sight.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has begun.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer, spirituality and donation are given a lot of importance in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can proudly proudly, we can proudly proudly gain that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is such a country where people who believe in God and those who deny God live, those who worship the statue and those who oppose the idol worship also live.
Every kind of thinking, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have inspired the art of living together and finally, religion, sect, tradition and tradition gives us the message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramadan will surely help in pursuing this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I extend my best wishes to everyone.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and especially asked the youth to do something new, come out of the compartment zone.
A new experience, and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way, some risks and problems can be invited.
I am glad that many people have reflected me.
Everyone showed me the enthusiasm to speak to me individually.
Some plays learn and some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
My reading habit was almost lost.
Therefore, I decided to read these vacations.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be made to give India freedom, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh who has done a lot at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to your generation in this regard.
I am happy that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Innumerable great men, who spent the youth in jail, laughed and laughed in the midst of many young fans.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
We must have seen that the great men who spent time in the freedom movement have done a lot of work in writing, study and their compositions have fulfilled Indias independence.
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
He went to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Birth Anniversary in jail.
He used to write poems and write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cottage.
Imagine how those who are fond of freedom will be foolish.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmath, I was inspired to see Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
There is no state in India, there is no language speaker in India, who has not given birth to his youth in this cellular jail in the jail of Andaman for independence, for the sake of black water.
Every language speaker, every region, every generation of people used to travel to the British, today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I will surely tell the youth of the country how people had to face the atrocities for the freedom that we have received. If we see the cellular jail then we will be aware.
Whenever you get the opportunity, you must go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of the month of June 5 is Monday.
Adding to nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi ji used to say several times - one must come out of a world one will not see.
That is, we should also take care of the world that we do not want.
If you are very tired and open the windows of the room, open the doors and fill the fresh air then a new consciousness comes.
When the commission is formed by the Mahabharata, it comes in contact with the Mahabharata, the self-confidence of a new consciousness emerges in our body - a new energy emerges.
We all have done this experience, but we don't remember it, we don't connect it in a dollar or in a dollar.
After this, you must see that when you are connected with the natural conditions, new consciousness will emerge within you and that is why the global campaign to connect with nature on 5th June should also be our own mission.
And we are getting some benefits from our ancestors protecting the environment.
If we protect ourselves, our future generations will be benefitted.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in the Vedas.
And Athurveda is the largest guide of the environment in a way and has been written thousands of years ago.
We say there: Mother Land: The sons of Ahm Prithviya: The Vedas say that the purity that we have is due to our earth.
The earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, it is a matter of fact that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his achievement of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had come down three trees.
But we need to connect it with modern waves in modern words.
These days, I continue to get news from the states.
In almost every state, a big campaign of plantation is going on as soon as rains come.
Crores of trees are planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June, now 21st June has become a well known day for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June world Yoga Day is spreading across every corner, connecting people.
On the one hand, when many powers of division are showing their distorted faces in the world, Yoga is a great gift to the world.
Through Yoga, we have added the world to a suit.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to race, due to increasing responsibilities, life of stress free is becoming difficult.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in the younger people.
Consumption of medicines and passing days, Yoga plays an important role in leading a stress-free life in such a situation.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible to experience the journey from the body, from the body, from the thoughts, through the ideas, through the medium of yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some of the competitions related to yoga.
Gradually, work will be done in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and asked me to do yoga together this time on the third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is grandparents or parents or daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their gestures.
Yesterday, if there will be such a smooth coincidence of today and tomorrow, Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched the Selfie with Dr.
These three generations of yoga will be awakened for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Start doing practices today.
I will continue to post something related to yoga from June 1 to Twitter and will continue to post till June 21.
I shall be with you.
You should also spread, spread and connect people for three weeks.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite all of you to join it.
Because I came to a very interesting phone call and I probably didn't think like this.
But I am grateful for the way he took this thing.
You will also be aware of this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am hungry, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have adopted cleanliness as a mission in a collective manner on your invitation.
The zeal that you have raised from the valleys of Kashi has now taken the form of a movement with your inspiration.
Your point is that wherever I go, the government system does the work of cleanliness but during these days also the festival of cleanliness becomes in the society.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, several cleanliness programmes are organised.
The media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine that I would be so happy to know that and how the country is also taking care of these things.
During my journey, what can be a matter of greater happiness for me
The other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be, but cleanliness will be important.
It is also an inspiration for any sanitation lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who help in the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me an instruction.
However, the suggestion is a little bit of joy.
I don't know whether I can do it or not.
Before visiting Modiji, tell those who want to invite you, what would be the level of cleanliness if you want to invite me
I felt very good, but I have to think.
It is, however, true that the movement should be initiated that it would be better to provide other things in the form of gifts that we should clean so many tons of waste and give them in gifts.
How many people can be prevented from getting ill.
How big will be the work of humanity
I would like to say one thing that we should not consider the waste that is waste, it is a healthy source.
Don't look at it as a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a very important campaign of West Management with the help of the State Governments as well as the representatives of the cities.
On June 5, World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in about 4,000 cities of the country.
Two types of wastes will be available, one green and the other blue.
There are two types of wastes - one liquid waste and the second dry waste.
If we live in administration, put the dry waste in blue waste and put the wet waste in green waste, like the waste emitted from the kitchens, the breasts of the vegetables, the bread, the bricks of the eggs or the leaves of the trees, all these are wet wastes and put them in green chapiters.
It will be remembered that if the color of the fields is green then what waste is to be put in the green waste.
And the remaining wastes such as rod papers, cardboards, iron, glass, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken pillars, rubber, metals, and many other negative things are called dry wastes which have to be recycled by putting in the machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard that the Versova Beach, which is considered to be dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean chemical fertilizer beach today.
Residents Volunteer (VRV) assumed its full responsibility.
I extend my best wishes to Shriman Afroz Shah.
I convey my best wishes to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region as a mass movement, it is indeed an inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for months, newspapers, TVs or social media, the accounts of the present government are continuously going on for three years.
Three years ago, you had given me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive signal.
This 3-year tenure has been marked on every episode.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe that the governments should be responsible in democracy, people should be given account of their work.
This movement is very important for an aware nation and a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, every thing has a good impact on me as it is on the minds of any ordinary citizen.
Mann Ki Baat is seen as a one-sided dialogue, some people criticize it politically, but after such a long experience, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think that the Mann Ki Baat program would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I am sitting in the middle of the house and talking about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, I have an impact in my mind as a common man.
Two days ago, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker, everyone launched a analytical book Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, whenever I get it, there will be rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the tests will have come, the start of the educational life will have to be started.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment to love nature.
I extend my best wishes to all of you.
Those who insist on reaching me are mostly those who actually do something in their lives.
He is working according to his intellect, strength, capability and conditions and when I came to mind, I felt that this suggestion is not normal, it has emerged from the bottom of the experience.
I never thought that today the youngsters in our country have been working for a long time.
Yes, we have come to know that some social institutions have been working for years, but I only knew that the youth of my country are engaged in it.
How many have sent a video to me
There are many places where roti banks run.
People gather bread on their behalf in this bread bank, harvest vegetables and those who are required to get it from there.
Those who give it are also satisfactory and those who take it will never have to look down.
This is an example of how the work is done with the help of society.
Today the month of April is being completed, the last day.
The first day of May is the establishment day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have made constant efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the development of the country.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when climate change was considered to be a subject of education and world, but today, we also feel it in our daily life and express it astonishingly.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The heat that takes place in our country in May-June is the time to experience in March-April and when I was getting information about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me more information on what should be done during this summer.
However, the lice is not new, but the reminding of it is very useful at that time.
Mr. Prasankumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
These friends have said that in the balcony, water should be put on the roof and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very well.
Once they understand why this water should be filled, then 10 times a day they go to see whether the vessels have water or not and whether the birds have come or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but in fact it is a wonderful experience to raise sensitivity in the minds of the child.
See, sometimes this feeling with animals and birds gives a new feeling of joy.
However, in our country, the words of animals and birds, the words of co-existence with nature and the colors of these things are enshrined, but it is important to strengthen such efforts in a collective manner.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dharmaguru Syed Saheb of Saudi Vohra society used to be hundred years old.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He shared about 52 thousand crocodile crocodile strings across the world.
He also got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that the printers, the milk, the vegetables, the posters, somebody comes to our courtyard, but we forget that the days are the days to come, before ask them for a little water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you too.
Sometimes I am worried that our younger generation is enjoyed living in ASEAM.
Parents also take care of them in a protective condition.
I am confident that some friends will surely try and tell me too.
If you use this time of vacation as per my suggestions then it is very good to implement three of them, but try to implement one of the three.
That feels a lice or a new feeling.
Try to learn new skills.
If you don't see, you don't know, but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading about it in the book or listening to the acquaintances and feelings of the same thing, both of them have a distance of distinction.
I would like to urge you to know whatever your curiosity is in this vacation, use a new one.
Whether it is positive or if it is a little comfortable, do it.
We belong to the middle class and belong to a happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again, feel it alone.
In the evening, take your football or take a volleyball or take any sports instrument and reach the poor population immediately.
You must play with those poor kids, you must see, you will have the pleasure of playing that you have never met before.
And I am confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs continue to serve.
Search for that thing that you are also associated with the Guru of Gugal.
But at the same time, you may feel that you have done such summits, if you have learnt the course of personality development then you should reach those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such camps and those people who have learnt without taking money.
You can learn how to develop.
Every person has been busy somewhere else with technology.
Community is also a reward and community is a strength.
Today is the time of rivalry.
Sometimes it feels scared that our younger generations are not becoming human robots
Far from technology, efforts to spend time with you.
Some words of music are learning 5-50 words of a new language, whether Tamil or Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
There are so many diverse countries and if you look at it, you can find somebody in our surroundings.
You want to learn car driving . Do you ever want to learn auto rickshaws
You have driven a cycle but the three-wheeler cycle that takes people has ever wanted to run.
You will see that all these new experiments are such a scheme that will give you joy and the life that has been tied up in a way, from which it will also expel you.
Friends, Do something out of Box.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you will be wondering that if all the tests are completed, they will not be able to learn when they are going to a new stage of work.
Later, you will be in other strokes and that is why I will tell you that if you are keen to learn magic then learn the leaf magic.
Keep showing miracles to your friends.
I say from my experience that seeing the world gets to learn and understand that we cannot imagine.
This will enable you to learn a lot.
I would like to share it with me when you are going.
What did you see
Where did you go
You share your experiences by using the "Heshteg Incredible India".
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
The Government of India is a scheme.
If Bhima App is downloading, you will also use it.
But refer to the other.
If a new person connects someone else and makes a three-standing transaction, if the economic business is done three times then you will get a sum of Rs.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you have done it from 20 people in a day, you will be able to earn 200 rupees on the evening.
Traders can also be earned and students can also be earned.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
You will contribute to creating Digital India.
You will become a guardian of New India.
So the vacation and earnings of the vacation.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but it is said that the red light looked at the vehicle, it looked on the car but it was drowned in the mind and the VIP culture was drowned in the mind.
Nobody can claim that the red light that has smelled in the brain has gone out of the red light now .
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed the possibility in that phone but now these phones are estimated from the calls that the common man does not like these things.
It feels that it will be removed.
I am speaking Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur from Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say something about the government's red beacon light ban.
I was very proud to hear a line in the Newspaper in which I wrote that every Indian is a VIP on a road.
I don't get stuck in traffic jams and I don't even have to stop for anyone.
So I would like to thank you very much for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that has been launched, our country is not being cleaned, the supply of VIP is also being cleaned from our roads. Thanks to the government's decision, it is a part of the system.
But we also have to take it out of our minds.
If we all work together, we will be able to get out.
New India is not our concept that the importance of EPI in place of VIP in the country increases.
And when I am calling EPI instead of VIP, I am clear that every person is import.
Every person has the importance, every person has the importance.
If we recognise the importance of 125 crore Indians, if we recognise the importance of 1.
We have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we keep recalling our history, our cultures and our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, 125 crore Indians.
Because of some reason, we have become so small that we think for more than a century.
The centuries have a great significance for other countries of the world.
But India is such ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories in its fortune.
How about a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that there was a great fight against Ramanujacharya ji's evil in the society, the feeling of touch and untouchability and casteism.
The society, which was considered untouchable by their conduct, was swallowed up.
Thousands of years ago, he had called for the entry of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every age, a great man is born from our society to eradicate the evil of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, there is strength in the organization for social unity, take inspiration from him to raise this feeling.
The Government of India is also going to relay a stamp in the memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji and pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is also a different significance.
It is also celebrated as a labour day in many parts of the world.
When the labourers are discussed, it is very natural to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people will be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities that workers get today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I also remember the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Guru Basweshwar ji.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to go to a venue.
It was an occasion to dedicate to the nation of his promise collections.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, a few days later, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems that the world is facing today, violence, war, vandalism, hostage competition...
When we see this environment, the ideas of Buddha are very relevant.
And in India, Ashoka's life is an excellent reflection of Buddha's journey from war.
I am fortunate that this great festival of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by United Nations.
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will be refreshed.
My dear countrymen, there has always been an effort to move ahead with the mantra of Saath Sahu Vikas in India.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to your brothers, most of the families in the country will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those whose exams have been completed will have a slightly light environment and those families where the exams are going on will still have a little concern.
But at this time I will say that listen to the things that I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
During the examination, the conversation will surely help you.
Today is 26th March.
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day.
A historic fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
On this important day, I extend my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence and wish that Bangladesh moves forward, develops and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our joint heritage.
Bangladesh's national anthem is also built by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913 and the British gave him the post of Nighthood.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that on 23rd March, Bhatta Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had the fear of serving Mother Bharati.
All the dreams of life were homage to Bharati's freedom struggle.
And these three heroes are still inspiration for all of us.
We cannot decorate the saga of sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was scared of these three youths.
There were tied up in the jail, the money was fixed, but how to move forward with it was anxious to the British.
And then it was only on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
Funds have been paid from the wheeler, which are not normally done.
And then the British had quietly burnt their body in Punjab today.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of wave on that land.
And I will surely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity, you must replace the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhatkeshwar Datt.
This was the time when the rapidity of freedom and its rapidity was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired many youths for the empire revolution and just a hundred years ago, on 10th April, 11th of Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This Champaran is the centenary year of Satyagraha.
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhian and Gandhian style were first seen in Champaran.
This was a major turning point in the entire movement of independence.
In particular, in the context of the way of struggle, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Satyagraha of the sportspersons, the struggle of millions of people in Ahmedabad, all of them had a strong impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and functioning.
In 15th, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 11th, he gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha.
Imagine that a person who returned to India in 115, only two years of work.
Neither did the country know them nor did they have the effect.
We can imagine how hard they must have suffered and how hard they must have worked.
And Champaran Satyagraha was in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization could be able to examine the nerves of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, with his behavior, the poorest of the British Sultanate, the inspiration for the struggle, bringing them to the ground for the struggle.
And therefore, in this form we feel the bravery of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think about Gandhi hundreds of years ago, that Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who starts public life.
We can learn from them how to start public life, how to work and how Gandhi had done it.
And this was the time when Gandhiji had sent the names of the elite Digge leaders to the villages that were Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani ji.
The way people were connected to the people, they were teaching the way to color them with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what is the way of Gandhi
Gandhiji knew that he had made a coin on both sides.
On one side of the coin, conflict on the other side.
On the one hand, filling the prison and on the other hand homage in creative activities.
There was a very amazing balance in Gandhi's functioning.
What is the word Satyagrah, what can be uncomfortable, what is non-cooperation in front of such a larger salt, Gandhiji has established a whole new idea not through words but through a successful experiment.
The desire for this change, the effort of this change is the same that will lay the foundation of a New India and a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party election or a project.
It is a feeling that 1. 25 billion people together want to create a grand India.
There is a hope in the minds of 1. 25 billion Indians, there is a feeling, a commitment, a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we take a little away from our lives and try to know what is happening around us, we will be surprised to see that lakhs of people look at something for their own obligations without selflessness, for the society, for the exploited, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, for the poor, for the poor.
And he is also doing as a man who penetrates, as a man.
Many people go to the hospital everyday and help patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood donation immediately .
There are many people who worry about their food if someone is hungry.
Our country is a multi-sectoral settlement.
This mantra is in our blood.
Once we want it as a collective, organised, we will know how much power it is.
When it comes to New India, it is very natural to see it from a different perspective and it is welcome to the democracy.
But it is true that the dream of New India-Russia Crore countrymen can be fulfilled in front of our eyes if the dreams of crores of people will be fulfilled.
And it is not necessary that all things happen from the budget, with government projects or government funds.
If every citizen decides that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen decides that I will fulfill my obligations with complete certification and sincerity. If every citizen decides that one day in a week I cannot use petrol and diesel in my life then how much change can happen.
It means that every citizen follows his civil religion, follows his duties.
It can automatically be a good beginning of New India.
My dear countrymen, I also express my gratitude to you.
In the last few days, there was an atmosphere in our country and a large number of people became part of digital payments and digital movements.
Its curiosity has also increased, how can there be transactions without cash.
The poor people are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving towards how to do business without cash.
Different types of digital payments have been seen in demonetization, post-notification.
Even though the BHIM App has been launched for just two and a half months, about one and a half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against corruption, can 1. 5 billion people resolve to work with digital negotiation in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they want to do this thing for 1. 25 billion Indians, they do not need to wait for one year, they can do it in six months.
If we have to fill the poor fees, we will not fill the cash, we will be filled with digital, we will have to travel in the railways, if we have to travel in the plane, we will pay digital payments and if we buy medicines then we will pay digital payments and we will run cheap food shops.
We can do this in everyday life.
You don't imagine but you can serve the country's greatest and you can become a brave soldier in fighting against black money and corruption.
Several programmes of the DigiDhan Mela have been organized for public education in the last few days.
It is a resolve to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There were also prize schemes.
About 12. 5 lakh people have received this award from the consumer.
0 thousand people have received the reward for traders.
And everyone has also decided to take this task forward.
And many times, as had already been decided, on 14th April, Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be concluded.
After the completion of a hundred days, the last major event is going to be held.
There is also a large dragon in it.
I am confident that in whatever time we have saved Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, we propagate Bhima App.
We should contribute to the reduction of cash transactions and the reduction of transactions from boats.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I ask the people for Mann Ki Baat then every kind of suggestion comes.
But I have seen that everybody has always been inspiring for the sanitation.
I want to talk to you about my mind.
I want to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
I pass through a river every day in which people burst a lot of waste and pollut the river.
It comes to my house flowing from the River Risp bridge.
Several people have also spoken about it, but it has no benefit.
And the best thing is that the Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, instructing me and also telling me that he has made a lot of efforts but he has been unsuccessful.
Cleanliness movement has started from Jayar.
Every person has been positively linked to it.
It has also taken the form of a movement.
The hatred towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness, active partnership, movement, all of them have their own importance.
But hygiene is linked to the habits of movement.
This is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create sanitation habits.
This movement can be collectively.
The work is difficult but to do it.
I am confident that this feeling has awakened in the new generation of the country, in children, in the students and in the youth and this is a sign of a good result.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell all those countrymen who are listening to the Gayatri that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
Since my dear countrymen, I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat since the beginning, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one thing and most people have expressed concern over the waste of food.
We know that we take more than required food in the family and also in the collective food programmes.
Whatever things they see, they cannot eat in the plate.
We cannot eat half of the plate that we fill in it and we walk there.
You have thought of how much harm we have left the food.
Did somebody think that if we don't waste food then we can fill the stomach of some poor.
Despite some efforts being made, sadness on this subject is a social treason.
Injustice to the poor.
I am not insisting on this matter, but I want to increase awareness.
Their lives inspire us not to spoil food.
We should eat as much as we have.
See, there are similar ways for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep a little stomach empty, keep a little plate empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression.
The problem is that there are people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are constrained to openly talk about this.
Those who are suffering from depression do not even speak because they themselves feel sad about this.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot be freed.
It needs to create a psychological environment and it is the first mantra to come out of it that instead of depression, it needs an expression.
Talk to your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes there is a feeling of loneliness and especially students living in the hotel have more problems.
Families are large, there are mixed and there are no chances of depression.
However, I want to tell my parents that you have seen that your daughters or daughters or any member of the family are sitting with everyone and they say that I don't stay anymore, then Jamish and they don't come on the table.
You must understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in the group and lives in the corners then keep in mind that it does not happen.
This is the best way.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical diseases.
Similarly, depression also finishes our sustainability, fighting, adventure and decision making capabilities.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your monastery can stop you from going into depression. And if you have gone then you can get out of it at the earliest.
Help with their hearts, share their happiness and sorrows, you will feel that your inner pain will end.
If you try to understand their griefs and work with a sense of service, then a new confidence will be born in you.
Your mind will be twelve lightened by connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in delivering stress free, stress free and towards happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
You all prepare and celebrate Yoga Festivals in millions of groups.
If you have any information about the third International Day of Yoga then send me through the mobile application.
Whatever songs and poetry works can be prepared about Yoga so that it can be easily understood to the people.
But along with work, women have special responsibilities.
They also take care of family responsibilities and also support family economic responsibilities, which sometimes cause injustice to their newborns.
The Government of India has then taken a very important decision that these nominees have been increased to 26 weeks at the time of their delivery, the Meternity Level which was earlier available for 12 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world who are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become the precious invaluables of the country.
It will also ensure the health of mothers and this will be an important decision.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the Formal Sector.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us, and can fulfil the resolve of New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukal patriot, Year Representative, New Year are the best wishes to all of them for this New Year.
This is a good time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after the monsoon season.
New year is celebrated in different forms in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only flowers, fruits on tree pots are seen shining in the sun.
Fruits of summer season also appear in spring .
On the other hand, turmeric flowers of mustard in the field stop the hope of the farmers.
The flowers of Kesuda indicate the arrival of the Holi.
Ameer Khusro has described the moments of weather change.
Amir Khusro has written: If the nature is happy, the weather is beautiful then the people also enjoy this season.
Festival of Vasanpanchami, Mahashivratri and Holi brightens the joy of human life.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to farewell to Fagan last month and I am ready to welcome the new month's Chaitra.
This is a coincidence of two months on spring.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of people of the country for the fact that whenever I ask for the message of mind, there is a lot of suggestions.
He has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that many people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO and hence he said, I will give some information about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
I am very grateful to all of you that you have sacrificed on the occasion of the pride of India.
Whether it is to eradicate poverty, to prevent diseases, to connect with the world, to reach knowledge and prosperity, technology, science has raised its place everywhere.
15 February, 2019 is a glorious day in India's life.
Our scientists have raised India's glass in front of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of sending Mars Mission on Mongol planet, ISRO has carried out a global cycle in the field of space in the last few days.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
Not only for Christ, but also a historic achievement for the entire India.
This Coast Effective Officers Space Programme of ISRO has become a wonderful one for the whole world and the world has lauded me for the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, these 104 satellites are very important.
CARTO SAT-2D is Indias satellite and will enhance its integral support for the planning of Urban Development, weaving resources, infrastructure and development.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how can it be used in the country, what should it be taken care of, this new satellite catro-sat-2D will help us a lot on all those issues.
Some of our satellites were sent as soon as they reached.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of joy for us that our young scientists, our women scientists have led the entire campaign.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a proud part of ISRO's success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The more we pay our respects to these scientists, their entire team is less.
Chaubhaji has asked another question and it is that India has achieved a very big achievement in the context of Indias security.
This has not been a very big discussion yet, but the attention of Chaubhaji has gone on this important thing.
India has also successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the field of Defence.
This interception technology missile, during its test, destroyed the enemy's missile at a height of about 100 km from the ground and successfully marked it.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that if India comes to an attack from a distance of 200 kms, then it will be destroyed in space.
We are happy when new technologies are required, when a new scientific achievement is achieved.
And curiosity has played a very big role in the development journey of human life.
And the specific intellectual talent does not allow curiosity to live in the form of a curiosity, it also raises questions within them, discovers new wisdom and creates new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for new research.
As long as he does not get the answer, he sat down with his legs.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years, we can say that this development journey of human life is not complete.
It is impossible to complete it.
Efforts are being made to know the rules and regulations of the universe.
New science and new technologies are produced.
And every technology gives birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about scientific and scientific hard work, I have often told me that our younger generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific becomes the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of generations in the future.
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs had planned a very unique competition on the 14th Pravasi Bharati Day.
Encouraging innovation was invited.
I have seen how to identify and display such research, inform people and how to use such research for the common man, how to produce jungles and how to do business and how important things have been done.
Many times the problem also showcases the importance of science to solve.
In 2005, there was rains in Mumbai, the floods occurred, the sea was filled and there was a lot of trouble, and whenever any natural calamity occurs, the first crisis comes to the poor.
The two brothers worked in a very heartfelt manner and they developed a house that protects the lives of the people from such hindrances, saves the lives of the people in the house, saves the lives of the people from the floods and prevents the diseases of water.
And our society is also becoming technology-based.
Arrangements are also based on technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, there was a lot of importance on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are coming out of the cash and moving towards digitization.
Digital transactions are also increasing rapidly in India.
In particular, youngsters have started taking the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes.
In our country, in the last few days, the Lucky Consumer Yojana Digidhan Business Scheme has received huge support.
About two months have passed and 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is a matter of great pleasure that so far 10 lakh people have received rewards under the Digidhan Yojana and more than 50 thousand traders have received rewards and more than 1.
Under this scheme, the most consumers are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received rewards of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, businessmen, households, students, all participate in this scheme with enthusiasm.
From Mysore, Shriman satisfactory wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a reward of Rs.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said, I got a reward of one thousand rupees and at that time I came to know that a poor old woman was hurt.
If the commodity was burnt then I felt that if I had got the reward, perhaps this poor mother had the right to do it then I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very inspirational job.
All the descendants keep giving knowledge of this digital.
I keep talking with so much enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and the people of this country, or the beneficiaries that they have received the DigiDhan Business Yojana.
You move it forward and it is in a way an anti-corruption worker.
In a way, you are a soldier of ethics.
You know, when the hundred days of the Lakhi Grahak Yojana will be completed, Dr.
It's a memorable day.
On April 14, there will be a draw of Rs.
Now there are about forty-four days left.
Can Babasaheb do a job after remembering Ambedkar
Babasaheb Ambedkars 125th birth anniversary.
Remembering them, you learn at least 125 people downloading the Bhima App.
Learn how to negotiate, and especially to the small traders around you.
I would like to say that this time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhima App will be given special importance.
This movement has been going on for the last two-three months, many townships, many villages and many cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a big contribution in the roots of our economy.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic movement of the country.
I want to tell you a lot of happiness today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the store of food.
This year, we have produced record food from the hard work of farmers in our country.
Every indication is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time in the fields, it seems as if Pongal and Baisakhi are celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
It is also 8 more than the last records that our farmers have received.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I would especially like to thank the farmers of the country.
I would also like to thank the farmers for their traditional crops as well as the poor of the country, because the poor get the highest protein from pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country have heard the sound of the poor and approximately two lakh hectares of pulses have been cultivated on the ground.
This is not only the production of pulses but also the biggest service to the poor of my country.
My farmer brothers and sisters are particularly grateful for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard on their edges and produced records.
My countrymen, this is going on in our country by the government, by the society, by organizations and by everybody in the direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone seems to be making aware about cleanliness in some form.
And in the Barangal of Telangana state, it was not only a seminar in the closed room but also to use what is the importance of direct cleanliness.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 1-18 February.
It was cleaned by vacating the toilets of six houses and the officers themselves showed that the twin pit toilets could be used by emptying the twin pits.
He also demonstrated how comfortable the toilets of the new technology and there is no discomfort in cleaning it, there is no contraction, no psychological borrier.
And we can clean the bay of a toilet just like this.
And the outcome of this endeavour was that through the country, it was impressed and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the Gulf of the Toilet then the attention of the country is natural.
And this is the cleanliness of the Toilet Pit, which we consider as waste, but in terms of financing, it is equal to a black gold.
We can see what happens from waste to health.
And this has been proved.
A standard 'Twin Pit Toilet' for the family of six members is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to another point.
In six to twelve months the waste accumulated in the PIT becomes completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe in handling and are very important in terms of fertilizer, NPK.
Farmers are very well aware of the NPK.
And now there is a special programme in Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as possible.
Different departments are also considered to be hygiene in the government.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Development - Ministry of Tribal Affairs will give a boost to this cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, will also pursue the Swachhta Abhiyan in the last two weeks in March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good then the whole country feels a new energy, the confidence increases.
We all welcomed the exhibition that our Divyang players performed in Rio Paralympics.
In the final of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and enhanced the pride of the country by becoming a world champion for the second consecutive time.
We are proud of the achievements of these Divyang friends of the country.
I often believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, brave and committed.
Every time we get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science or women of our country are not behind anyone.
The country's name is illuminating with their achievements.
In the last few days, our women players won Silver Medal in Asian Rugbi Sevens Trophy.
I extend my best wishes to every player.
The entire world celebrates Women's Day on 8th March.
In India too, there is an increase in sensitivity, to give importance to children and to raise awareness about them in the family and society.
The 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign for social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has connected the common man.
This bright issue in every corner of the country has forced people to think and has brought about changes in the ideas of people towards the old traditions that have been going on for years.
When the news is that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the child, it is very happy.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming the cause of social independence.
I have heard that under a special drive in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, child birth has been banned.
More than 15 children have been stopped so far.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao Yojana and along with the organisation of village councils, efforts are being made by the district administration to take orphans and ensure their lives.
Under the 'Har Ghar Dastak' programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the reading of children from village to village.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire the children who had been drop-out by running the 'Apna Kisan Apna Vidyalaya' campaign.
It means that this movement of 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' has taken many forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New visions are linked to it.
It has been descended as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign and when we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen, you have the opportunity to interact at different times in Mann Ki Baat.
I know a lot from you.
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated many festivals.
The Sri Lankan birth anniversary was celebrated yesterday in the whole of India.
And every person can find solutions to the current problems from the life of Sri Krishna.
Sometimes it feels a sense of innovation in every case.
And that is why today when I am talking to you, I look at two Mohans.
Even thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhari had used a lot of thoughts and duties to avoid the struggle to prevent the war.
And Charkhadhari Mohan was also chosen as a way for freedom, for the lives of human values, for the empowerment of personality and for the people of freedom, he gave a turn to the people of freedom, which is surprising for the whole world.
We can learn from the message of Lord Krishna, whether it is the importance of selfless service or knowledge or the importance of laughing in the midst of all the ups and downs in life.
Today, when we are discussing the festivals, India is engaged in the preparation of a greater festival.
And not only India, it is being discussed all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new dimension to human history, established new dimensions.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way he has become a part of his life.
Whenever anybody was required, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for service.
He not only gave importance to service but also stressed on self-confidence associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, society, humanity and humanity were inclusive.
Whether it is a Financial Form in Africa or a Tolstoy Form, a Sabarmati Ashram or a Vardha Ashram, he laid a special emphasis on social development and community movement at all places.
I am fortunate to be here that I have got the opportunity to salute myself by visiting many important places associated with the worship of Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi was also focusing on organisationalisms with a sense of service.
Social service and social development, Community Services and Community Mobility are the ideas that we can bring down in our lives.
In fact, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true worker.
No, my countrymen.
And the community has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi centuries also have community and service.
Why shouldn't we come out together
If we have a team of football, then we will play football teams and footballs, but we will also work alone for the service as per Gandhi ideals.
You can do a lot, share old books together and spread knowledge among the poor.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore visions and 130 crore courage.
Be it goodwill, be it good wishes, be it good wishes, and be served with full dedication, and they are also made independently for a feeling of joy and joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Gujarat.
Satyagraha of salt in the freedom struggle, Dandi is an important turning point.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
I urge you to visit some place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Whether it is Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha's ashram, it is connected to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two-four words while expressing your feelings.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But in this context, one thing is very interesting, which I want to share with you.
Venice Bienal is a well-known art programme where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, there is a very interesting exhibition attached to Gandhiji's memories in the Indian pavilion of Venice Bienal.
The details of Haripura were specifically interesting.
You will remember that the Congress was convened in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose, the President was elected, was also involved in history.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and showcase their art work during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose arts enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And their art instruments have made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the surrounding villages of Haripura and then made some art paintings depicting the lives of rural India.
There was a lot of discussion in the Venice of unmatched arts.
On the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I once again look forward to making a resolution from all Indians.
Anything should be done for the country, for the society, for some mercury.
You will remember that in the last few years, we have been conducting the Swachhta Abhiyan for nearly two weeks before next October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will dedicate ourselves to Mahatma Gandhi through labour.
Whether it is a house or a street, a chawk or a drain, a school, a college, a massive campaign of cleanliness will be organized at all public places.
This time there is a special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eradicate the use of plastics working together.
This time, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will dedicate India to him, and on that day we will also lay the foundation stone of a new public movement against plastic across the country.
I urge all the sections of the society, every village and the residents of small and big cities to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a plastic waste free.
On 2nd October as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, becomes a festival of special labour.
All the municipalities, municipalities, district-rural systems, village panchayats, government-run systems, all organisations, one civilian, all of them are requested to make proper arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste.
I also urge the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they will come forward to get rid of it.
It can be recycled.
It can be made strong by this.
This way, we can also fulfil the work of safe evacuation of plastic wastes till Diwali.
Just need a pledge.
There is no need to see the event for inspiration.
Someone else can be inspired by Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit is in a way of knowledge.
We can find out what we want in life.
Now, my contact with them has decreased.
But earlier I had a lot of contact.
Today, I want to touch a very important thing from a Sanskrit definition.
And these things are written centuries ago, but how important is it even today.
An excellent definition and he said: The third day of the earth, Jalm Annam Subhastham, Mudhai: Pathankhesh Ratn Sanksha Pradityatta, or the three dates of water, food and well-known in the earth.
The fools are called rocks.
There is a very high month of food in our culture.
It has also transformed the knowledge of food into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once one thing was brought in my mind.
Muthambhir Dhani has become a big movement in Nashik.
Anganwadi workers gather cereals in the days of crop calculations.
The cereals are used to make fresh food for children and women.
The donor becomes a citizen, a social worker in a way.
After that, he is dedicated to this goal and becomes a syphi for this movement.
We all have heard about the Anna Prashan Sanskrit in every corner of India.
This award is done when the child starts feeding a fixed meal for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted.
People in many states run a hospitality drive.
If anybody's birth anniversary is a good day or a memorable day, then the members of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food, going to school and the members of the family themselves feed their children, share their happiness and increase their happiness.
There is a magnificent mix of service and joy.
Friends, There are many such things that our country can fight against malnutrition effectively.
Today, due to lack of awareness, both poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutrition campaign across the country.
However, I have been associated with the youth from all over the world and I didn't even think that this would be my place in the hearts of our country and the youth of the world.
I did not even think of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to.
I didn't think that there would be any opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
And how does it become - I went to Bhutan last week.
I have seen that as the Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to visit somebody and because of the International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if someone in the world meets and sits then some five-seven minutes accompany me with the question of Yoga.
Discovery has organised this programme in 165 countries in their language.
Today, I am confident that this APSOD of the Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world in the context of the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in India's cultural journey.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that even if some people ask me, Modi ji said that if you used to speak Hindi and beer grills don't know Hindi then how would you have been interacting with you so fast
Or later, audited.
I ask you very wisely.
Jumps, there's no secret in this.
If this question is in the minds of many people then I will declare this mystery.
Well, it's not a secret.
The fact is that technology has been enormously used in interactions with beer grills.
Friends, it used to be interpreted and a smallcordless instrument was installed in the ears of beer grills, so that it used to be used in English.
Although I used to speak Hindi, but it used to be used to be associated with English and this would make dialogue easier and this is the common thing of technology.
After this show, I have seen a large number of people discussing the Gem Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures .
I have said before and I am telling you loudly that Ishaan Bharat must go to your life.
The world within you will expand.
From the Red Fort on 15th August, I had urged you all to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
He also visited 15 such places for 100 tourism, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
The country full of diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will be expanded.
Your thoughts will be broad.
And trust me that there are places within India from where you will come with a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new inspiration.
Your family will also be mindful.
My dear countrymen, environmental care and concerns are naturally seen in India.
Last month, I was fortunate to declare a tiger settlement in the country.
You know how many tigers are in India
A resolution was taken by expressing concern over the declining settlement of tigers in the world.
It was a commitment to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, that we swiftly achieve the goals.
We have doubled the settlement of the tigers in 2017.
Not only the population of tigers in India, but the number of reserved areas and community reserved places has also increased.
When I was declaring a tiger settlement, I also remembered the lions of Gujarat.
When I assumed the charge of the Chief Minister, the residence area of the lions was shrinking in the jungle of Gir.
Their number was decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2009, it was decided to hold women guards.
Infrastructure reforms to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about protection.
But now you have to think about the compassionate compassion ahead of the defence.
Our scriptures have received very good guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget that historic statement of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 183
The young saints of India, who surprised the humanity of the whole world, had left India's brightest identity in the world.
Come, let us inspire Swami Vivekananda ji to live in the form of India that Swami Vivekanand ji had seen.
We have everything inside and come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 2nd August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
On this occasion, the Fit India Movement-specific India Mission will be launched across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the month of September, especially in the Swachhta Abhiyan from 11th to 2nd October and for the entirely dedicated plastic free.
Let us come out with a new emotion, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, this is the same in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your words, your suggestions.
Come, let us all come together to make India the dreams of Independence Days, to realize Gandhi's dreams - self-sufficient, self-sufficient, self-sufficient, self-sufficient and self-sufficient joy.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we all celebrated our Republic Day with fervor and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at all times, the importance of the rights that are given should also be achieved.
The vehicle of India's democracy can move forward at a sufficient pace only on two sides of authority and duty.
Yesterday is 30 January, our revered Bapu's death anniversary.
On January 30, we pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping it silent for two minutes at 11 o'clock.
As a society, as a country, on January 30, it should be a comfortable feeling of paying two minutes at 11.
Though it is only 2 minutes, it should also showcase the faith of community, commitment and martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple feeling of respect towards the armed forces and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I extend my best wishes to the brave people and their families who have been honoured with different bravery awards.
The awards include several categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I especially urge the youth and you are very active in the social media.
You can do one thing. This time the heroes who have received this honor, write two good words related to your network and spread it to your colleagues.
When we know about their courage, valour and valour, we are also surprised, we are also proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when we were happy with the news of the excitement and enthusiasm of 26th January, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir became brave due to the avalanches.
I salute and pay homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I have been continuously doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months are the months of Kasoti for every family.
There are tests of one or two children at home, but the entire family is under the pressure of examination.
So I believe that this is the right time that I will talk to the students friends, I will talk to their accomplices, their teachers, because for many years I have visited where I met, the test was a cause of a very big problem.
There is a strange psychological environment in every household.
And I always feel that I should get out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in some way.
When I announced this, many teachers, girls and students sent me messages, sent questions, expressed their pain and expressed their grief and thought about the concerns that I am talking to you today.
I got a telephone message from the world.
So I want to ask you so much that this situation cannot be happy
The question has been asked by the world but this question will be in your minds.
The test should be an opportunity of happiness.
This festival should be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm that has worked for the entire year, which has come to showcase.
There are very few people for whom exams are happy, but exams are a pressure for most people.
It is to be decided that you will be happy to accept pressure.
The joy that will be recognised and the pressure that will be recognised will increase.
And that is why I believe that the test is a festival, take the test in such a way that when the festival is held, the best in us comes out.
The strength of the society is also felt at the time of the festival.
If we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh Mela for 40-45 days, we will be able to imagine what is the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the problem in the people.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examinations, there should be a festival of neighbourhood in the entire family and friends.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festivals will make the environment free of burden.
And I urge my parents to make you a festival environment for this three-four months.
It is our responsibility to make these three-four months in our way, understand our tradition, understand the atmosphere of our family and make it a festival.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you have seen yourself relaxed. You have easily relaxed and when you are relaxed then you will also remember your years old things.
A year ago, what the teacher had said in classroom will be remembered.
And you must be aware that the strength to recall memory is the highest in relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door stops, the outside does not go inside and the inside does not come out.
The thought process stops, which itself becomes a burden.
You might have seen in the examination that you remember everything, you might remember the skull, the subject, the leaf cream, the leaf cream, the leaf in the leaf is written upwards and it is also reminded of it.
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure.
But what was inside came out immediately and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine for recalling the memory then it is a relaxation.
And this is what I say on the basis of self-confidence that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there are relaxation then we have never imagined and suddenly those things that are very useful.
And it is not that you don't have knowledge, you don't have information, you don't have to labour.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your information is depressed and your tension is lost on it.
And that is why it is important that A Happy Mind is the certificate for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see exams in the true perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life and death.
The exams that you are going to give are the tests that you have read all year.
It is not the story of your life.
There is no test of how you live, how you live and how you want to live.
In your lives, there may have been a chance to pass through several stories in addition to the tests given in the classroom.
And that is why, with the success of life, get rid of such burdens that there is any god to test.
Our former President, Dr.
Hey.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is an inspirational example.
Some writer Anandji has sent me a question: If I can see the biggest challenge before education at this time, it is that education has become centered.
The qualities have become the most important.
This has led to a lot of competition and stress has also increased in the students.
So I want to know your ideas about this current direction of education and its future.
Although they have given their answers, but Rechaji wants me to present my words here too.
Marx and marksheets are very limited use.
There is no such thing in life.
Life runs on how much knowledge you have achieved.
Whether or not you have tried to live with what you have known, lives on it.
The sense of mission that you have received, whether it is your sense of communications or not, your mission and communications are going on.
If you believe in such matters, you will not have to run behind the marks.
You will be able to use knowledge, skills, self-confidence and imagination.
You must tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every person from the family will go to him who is a family doctor.
None of you would have asked the family doctor how many qualities he had passed.
Nobody has asked.
Yes, you feel that brother, as a doctor, you are getting benefits and you have started taking care of them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the marksheet of that lawyer
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the qualities that are stressed are sometimes preventing us from moving towards the right direction.
But it doesn't mean that I don't mean to read.
Its use is essential for our story.
It is important to know where I was yesterday and where I am today.
Sometimes it happens and if you look at your own life from close then you will be aware that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find some ways, you will catch some select things and focus on it.
But if you focus on the quality then gradually you are shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get the mark.
It may be that despite being encouraging in the examination, sometimes the life becomes unsuccessful.
Richaji has said one thing - competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
In fact, competitiveness does not work to move ahead of life, competitiveness comes to the forefront of life and whenever I call for competitiveness, it means to compete with me.
How should the future be better than ever .
One speciality of the lives of most of the successful players is that they compete.
We take the example of Shriman Sachin Tandulkar ji.
When friends are going to give tests in every field of life then think that if you can read for two hours peacefully then you can read for three hours .
Shriman S.
Sundar ji has expressed his condolences on the role of girlfriends.
They say that the role of girls in the examination is very important.
He has written more: My mother was not reading, yet she sat with me and asked me to count.
Because the mothers are aware of the future of the children in the house, they make things very easier.
Once you learn to accept, most of the problems will end there.
Every girl would have experienced this thing.
The girls are at the root of the problem as compared to teachers.
Acceptance opens the way for resolving problems.
Obligations make it difficult.
Accepting the situation gives a chance to open a new way.
And therefore, accept what is.
I was present at that time and I saw that they came there and did not ask a single question about their health.
He sat down and didn't talk about what is the situation and what is the disease.
In the first two-four minutes the atmosphere was lightened.
We are often afraid of disease by going to the sick person.
I would like to tell the girls that sometimes we do the same with the children.
Did you ever feel that in the days of examination give the child the atmosphere of laughter and joy
You see, the weather will change.
I have received a call from a common man.
Namaskar, eldest Prime Minister, I can't say my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to imitate and pass, I got caught in it and because of me many friends around me suffered a lot.
You must have heard that many times don't cheat, don't cheat.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once there is a habit of Chori, there will be no desire to learn anything in life.
Then where can you reach
Their entire creativity, such a time, if you read in the preparation of the examination then perhaps you will not need to copy.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that we have raised during our examination and my second question is why the test looks loaded or why not thank you for lightly.
If we have to develop inclusively, there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn.
Someone says I'm going to pass all these tests first, then I'm going to come.
So it's impossible.
Then the rest of the parts of the body should also get physical activities .
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front of you then you can go out for two moments and take a look at the trees and plants and make your mind lighter.
By doing so, you will see, with a freshness, you will come in your rooms and your books.
Keep whatever you are doing for a while, stand out, go to the kitchen and find out what you like. If you get the costly biscuit then eat.
Just five minutes, take some breaks.
There's no need to be locked in a room to breathe deep.
Go down a little below the open sky, go to the forehead, take five minutes deep breath and sit back to read again.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will not only become light but will also make the brain light .
Some people think that they will wake up late at night - I will read more, yes.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs .
It'll be fresh.
Your efficiency will increase a lot.
Whenever I meet at the time of elections, my throat is sitting.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me how many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
So, indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then we will be benefitted, you will see.
But this does not mean that just sleeping.
Don't do this, otherwise the people of your family will be deprived of me.
And on the day your marksheet will come, I will not see them.
This is a very big medicine to keep the mind, intelligence, body alert.
But at the same time, he will also say, do not let the emphasis on what I have said.
I also feel that the way I invite your family to not be able to make your parents loser.
Remembering your commitment, go to the test by trusting yourself.
I have a lot of good wishes.
Make a festival to get out of every colony.
And then there will never be a skeleton.
Please take this mantra forward.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, February 2019 is being concluded forty years on the Indian Coast Guard.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that Coast Guard has made its place among the four largest coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, Coast Garden people had taken a big initiative to clean the beach of our country along with their obligations and thousands of people were involved in it.
And very few people will be aware that in our country, not only men but also women are equally fulfilling their obligations in the Coast Guard.
Coast Garden is not only a pilot, observer, but also a horrorcraft.
Today, when maritime security is a matter of great importance all over the world, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard on its twenty-fourth anniversary in Indias maritime security.
The Festival of Spring Commission is held on 1st February.
Spring has been approved as the best season.
Spring is the queen of seasons .
The occasion of worship of Vidya is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My Rang De Basanti Chola - This is the inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this spring commission.
My dear countrymen, Akashwani in Mann Ki Baat also always fills new forms with his imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to my mind in regional languages.
It has got widespread approval.
People from far-off places are writing letters.
I congratulate Akashwani for the work done by his own inspiration.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to you all for Christmas.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Jesus said that the poor are not our bounty, but we want to accept that Lord Jesus has not only served the poor but also described the service made by the poor. This is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with it which is very popular.
It is said in the statement that Lord Jesus was standing near the throne of a temple.
Several eminent people came there and they donated immensely.
After that a poor widow came and he donated two copper copper coins as a donor.
If you want to see that two copper copper coins are not a big donation.
It is very natural for the devotees present there to be confused.
When Lord Jesus said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot in donating but this woman has dedicated her to her universal donation.
Today, on 25th December, the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji, awakening the commitment and confidence of the Indian people, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development projects in Banaras.
I have laid the Foundation Stone of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is being constructed in the entire region, not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today, India is also the birth anniversary of Ratna and former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget Atal ji's contribution.
Under his leadership, we have achieved success in the field of atomic energy and honoured the nation.
Whether the party leaders or the Parliamentarians, the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji presented an ideal ideal in every role.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories are swollen in front of them.
Today, on the day of Christmas, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefits of two schemes.
Secondly, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is village or city, educated or uneducated, how cashless trade is going on, how can it be purchased without cash
Everybody wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, to strengthen the mobile banking, two new incentives are being launched by the Government of India, for consumers and small traders to introduce e-payment habits.
To encourage one scheme to beneficiaries - Locky Consumer Scheme and the other scheme - Digital Trade Scheme to promote traders.
Today, as a gift of Christmas on 25th December, 15 thousand people will get rewards from the dro system and they will be filled with a prize of one thousand rupees in the accounts of 15 thousand people and this gift is not just a single day. This scheme will start from today to 100 days.
Every day 15 thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees.
In 100 days, lakhs of households are going to get a gift of crores of rupees but this reward will be made entitled when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay Card, UPI, USSD- this digital payment system.
With this, there will be a large drone of one day in a week, with prizes of lakhs and after three months, on 14th April, Dr.
When Baba Saheb Ambedkar is the birth anniversary, there will be a bumper dro, which will have crores of prizes.
The Digital Trade Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businessmen themselves join this scheme and make their business a hallmark.
Such traders will also be given different rewards and these rewards will be in thousands.
The traders will also have their own business and will also get rewards.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class in the center, and that is why those people who buy something more than Rs. 50 and buy less than three thousand will get the benefit of this scheme.
Those who buy more than three thousand rupees will not get the benefit of this reward.
The poorest of the poor can also use USSD and buy goods through mobile phones and sell goods and earn money and every person can become the beneficiaries of this scheme.
People in rural areas can also buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win rewards.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this reward scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be able to enjoy this system and the youth around you will be aware of it and you will be able to ask them.
Hey, your family will also have children studying in class 12 in 10. Those people will also be able to learn this easily.
This is a very easy task - the way you have sent a watch-up message from mobile phones.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments and online payments are increasing rapidly.
In the last few days, cashless trade has increased from 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
This decision is so big that businessmen can apply properly.
The businessmen who will sell digital transactions will develop online payment system instead of investing in their business, such traders have been freed from income tax.
Everybody has moved forward this campaign as its own.
A committee headed by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu, is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that many state governments have also started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Assam Government has decided to liquidate 10 percent on the digital payment of Property Tax and Trade License Fee.
Those rural banks who will make at least two digital transactions of their 5 percent of their consumers during the period between January and March, will get a reward of Rs. 50 thousand from the Government.
As on 31st March, 2019, 100 Digital Transfers have been announced by the Government to provide a reward of Rs. 5 lakh under Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transfer.
Under Digital Agricultural Shiromany, the Government of Assam has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, which will be fully used for digital payments for the purchase of second and fertilizer.
I convey my best wishes to the Government of Assam and to every government that starts this kind of commemoration.
Many institutions have also made many successful uses to promote digital purchases and distribution among the poorest of the village.
I have come to know that the GNFC-Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, which mainly works as fertilizer, has been set up to facilitate the farmers, where they sell fertilizers, a thousand POS machines and 35 thousand fertilizers bags have been distributed through digital and this work has happened in the last two weeks and it is a matter of joy that compared to last year, GNFC has increased by 2 percent.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, informal sector is very big and most of the people are paid in wages, money or wages in cash, they are paying wages from the obstacles and we know that this is the reason for the exploitation of the workers.
Where they should get 100 rupees, they should get 80, they should get 50 and they are also deprived of other healthcare facilities like insurance.
But now cashless payments are being made.
The money is being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the absorption is shutting down and it has also been closed and it has become possible for the workers and workers to get full returns to such ordinary people.
They are also entitled to the benefits of other benefits as well.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
We have access to technology.
India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youth have made a lot of progress from start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
We should also connect our youth with new ideas, with new technologies and with new methods to strengthen this sector as well as with the campaign to get rid of black money and corruption.
Most of the people in the sections of other writers have taken care of the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's wishes, such a sacred thing, but people have also mentioned how there is a scarcity and how they are looking for new ways for wrongs.
And the third step is that in which people have supported it, but with the help of this fight, corruption and black money should be destroyed, there should be more stringent steps, such zealous and writers.
I am grateful to the people of the country that they have helped me write all such letters.
Mr. Gurumani has written only on My Goa: "This step to curb black money is commendable.
We are bothering our citizens, but we are fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support that we are giving in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like workers. The feelings of the words written by Gurumani Kebalji are emerging in the corner of the country.
We are all feeling it.
But it is also true that when people are suffering, when they are suffering, there is a person who does not have any pain .
I also suffer as much pain as you have.
But for an excellent goal, the people of the country continue to be in the midst of pains and pains when they work well in order to achieve a higher goal.
In fact, these people are the foremost of change.
I also thank the people for another reason that they have not only made troubles but have also responded to listening to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
Someone has said that the salt prices have increased, somebody has to spread, somebody has to cancel the 2000 note, 5000 and 100 notes are going to be canceled.
I also salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, I am feeling clear that when the people of the country have risen with you, nothing is impossible.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I salute them that people have participated in this Mahayagya in front of corruption and black money.
There will also be widespread discussions in the Parliament for the grant of political parties.
If there was a Parliament, it would have been a good discussion.
Those who are spreading the news that all the political parties are freed are wrong.
Those who are unable to support the open corruption and black money, they are fully engaged in search of the government's tricks.
This government is for the welfare of the people.
The government is constantly trying to take the representation of the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the eighth day that this fight is extraordinary.
The potential that has been linked to the black money of illiteracy and corruption for 0 years is so powerful.
Whenever I have decided to compete with such people, those people also adopt new ways to defeat the government.
I want to convey my heartfelt congratulations to the countrymen.
How did this become possible
I told her mystery.
The mystery is that I am getting all these information from the people.
The information received from the government system is getting many times more from the people of the legacy and most of us are getting success due to the awareness of the common people.
Can a citizen of my country imagine how many risks are being raised to open such elements
And most of the information that is being received is getting success.
I am confident that the government has given an email address that you can also send it on whom you are asking for this kind of receipt.
You can also send it on my Goa.
There is also a third group of letter writers and they are also in large numbers.
He says: Modi ji will not be tired, will not stop, and you will have to take the harder steps, but now we have to reach Manjeel.
I express my gratitude to all those who write such letters, because there is a kind of faith and blessings in their letters.
And there is no question of returning to the work for which the blessings of 1.
We have expelled it and have made the law of a very strong Benami Property.
In the coming days, the legislation will also work.
We have the priorities to do whatever we have to do for the welfare of the nation.
My dear countrymen, even in Mann Ki Baat last month, I had said that even during these difficulties, our farmers have done hard work and broken the record of last year in business.
This is a good sign from the point of view of agriculture.
Whether it is the labour of this country or the farmers of this country or the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the past, on the world's economic forum, India has depicted its name very proudly in many fields.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have achieved 16 ranks in the Global Naval Index-2016 and the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index has improved by 1 rank in 2016.
There are many reports which have been directed in the assessment of this direction and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also expressed his open denial.
But sometimes some good things are made in such events, and then the mind gets a great satisfaction.
There was an excellent work in the midst of the House of Parliament, towards which the attention of the country was not taken.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am very proud to say that a legislative legislation related to the campaign that my government had taken about Divyang-Ji was passed in Parliament.
I also express my gratitude to all the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to millions of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to Divyangs.
I have also tried to make it more conscious even individually.
I meant that the Divyangjans get their hugs and honours, whom they are entitled.
Our efforts and trust were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters when they brought four medals in Paralmipics.
He has not only enhanced the dignity of the country but has also surprised the people with his capacity.
Our Divyang Brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, we have an invaluable heritage, we can be immensely immense.
Today, I am happy that after the passage of this law in the interest of the Divyangjans, the Divyangjans will have more employment opportunities.
For them, the limit for reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides special provisions for prevention of education, facilities and complaints of Divyangjans.
You can guess how sensitive the government is to the Divyangjans. In the last two years, the central government has set up 4,350 camps for Divyangjans.
The government has passed new laws in accordance with the spirit of nationhood.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been information from the field of sports that have honoured us all.
Being an Indian, it is very natural for us all to be proud.
The Indian Cricket Team has won a four-wheeler category against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were eligible to describe.
Varat Kohli of the test dreaded a good batting as well as a good leadership.
Indian Cricket Team's Off-Spinner R.
ICC has declared Ashwin the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016.
My best wishes to this brother-in-law.
Even after fifteen years, good news came in the field of hockey.
Our Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity has come to the forefront that the Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young players for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons have also made amends.
Indias Women's Hockey Team also won the Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago, India's Women's Hockey Team won the bronze at the Asia Cup Competition for players below 18 years.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of the cricket and hockey team.
Last month, we were enjoying Deepavali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Deepavali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Deepavali.
I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas with the soldiers of ITBP.
He looked full of emotions and not only this, the message of good wishes that the countrymen had sent was a wonderful reflection in their happiness.
And people did not just send messages but they were connected to the mind.
Someone made a video that means almost every house has become a post of soldiers.
And whenever I used to see these letters, I was also surprised that how much imagination is, how much feelings are filled and MyGov had thought of making a coffee table book with some selected things.
Work is underway.
With the contribution of all of you, the vision of all of you about the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be integrated into this scripture.
But it didn't seem like that this time.
This time it didn't seem that there are festivals and I am not at home.
It seems that we are also celebrating Diwali with millions of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
Some time ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanchs of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, with such a brutality, these serpents of the villages have touched my heart.
I urged them to go and concentrate on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all those Sarpanches who came from the Kashmir Valley had fulfilled the promises made to me, they went to the villages and awakened them all.
A few days ago, when the board was tested, about 95 of the students and students from Kashmir participated in the board test.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board tests indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I would like to congratulate them for their enthusiasm, but I also congratulate their parents, their own people, their teachers and all the village Sarpanches.
Dear Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked the people to inquire about Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the suggestions of all have come on one side.
Everyone used to say that talk in detail on the note of 5000 and one thousand.
However, on 8th November, at eight o'clock in the night, I had discussed the launch of a massive campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decisions are, the more important it is.
And I was supposed to have to face many new problems in our normal life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take only fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal situation.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-four years cannot be easier.
I can understand your problems and complications well.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to illustrate you, even though sometimes the things that embarrass the mind are coming out, you have understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing well for the country's interest of shutting down the notes of five hundred and thousand.
And such a big country, such a number of boats, and this decision-making, the world is very closely watching, every economist is analyzing and assessing it.
The whole world is looking at whether the residents of India will be able to achieve even by tackling the problems of millions of Indians.
Perhaps there may be questions in the mind of the world.
India has only faith in millions of people of India and it is believed that hundreds of millions of people will continue to fulfil their commitments.
And our country will emerge in every way like gold and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
The path of this success has also become possible due to you.
Lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night in all the units of central government, state governments and local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches.
In the midst of various kinds of tensions, all these people have been working with a very quiet mind and regarding it as a yagna of service to the country as an attempt to make a great change.
If you start in the morning, you don't even know when the night will come, but all are doing it.
And that is why it is clear that India will succeed in this.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and the post office are working in such a situation.
And if we talk about humanity, they look two times ahead.
Someone told me that an older brother had an accident in the separation.
Suddenly money was required.
I am glad to know that the local bank employees had brought money to their homes so that they could help in treatment.
Innumerable cases come out in TV, media and newspapers every day.
I express my sincere gratitude to all those who labour in this Mahayag.
The pursuit of power will take place only when we cross the pocket.
I remember exactly that the campaign of the big Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was underway and the way the bank employees took it on their shoulders and the work that was not done in the seventeenth year was shown by them.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the commitment of hundreds of millions of countrymen and the collective support of all will make this nation a new strength.
They are looking for unlawful ways to save their money.
It is a matter of sadness that even in this, he has discovered the way using the poor.
Some people are trying to save the money by embarrassing the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
I would like to tell such people today whether to improve or not, whether to adhere to your law or not, it will be your duty.
But please do not disturb the lives of the poor.
You should not do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and afterwards when the investigation is done, my dear poor people get stuck in difficulty due to your sin.
And there is such a stringent law of benami wealth that is being implemented in this regard, there will be a lot of problems and the government does not want the people of our country to face any problem.
My name crosses Ashish.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Taluko, Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
I want to say many examples in Mann Ki Baat that people have welcomed this tough decision for the upliftment of their nation, which will enhance the enthusiasm of the people and I am with the entire country that the cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have shut down the number of thousands and five hundred.
I call Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you because you said good days will come, but nobody thought you would make such a big decision.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all these, black money and corrupt people have got their knowledge.
Every citizen of India will never have better days than this.
I would like to thank you all for this.
Some things are known through the medium of media, through the medium of government instruments, the enthusiasm to work increases.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that how the common man has a wonderful potential in my country.
If you get the opportunity to go back to the ground then you will definitely pay the money.
And people go there, gather and pay the money when they pass again after two-four days.
This is the strength of my country, including the spirit of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss Cha in the elections and this has reached all over the world.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to speak Cha-Parch.
But I didn't know that there was a marriage in the discussion on Cha.
I came to know that on 17th November, there was a marriage in Surat that took place with the discussion on Cha.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl had only given tea to those who came there in marriage and did not spend any other cost.
Surat's Bharat My and Daksha Paramar, who have contributed to the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, have become an inspiration.
When I was late at night, I saw TV and I saw that there is a small village named Dhekia Julie in Assam.
There are tea plantation workers and they get money every week.
What did he do when he got a note of two thousand rupees
When four women of the neighborhood gathered together and bought them all along and paid them with a note of two thousand rupees, they did not need a small note because they bought it together and decided that when they meet the next week, we will sit and take stock of it.
People are looking for ways of their own.
And also see changes.
The people of the tea plantations of Assam are saying that we should set up ATMs there.
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefits from this campaign.
The country will get the benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipality gets a tax rate of 50 per cent.
But this time, due to this decision on 8th, all the people ran to submit their old notes.
47 urban units have been taxed at around Rs. 3-500 crore this year.
You will be surprised to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the same week.
Now if there are four times the money in the municipality then it is natural that there will be an arrangement of gas in the poor population, water will be arranged, Anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples in which its direct benefits are also visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our village and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is ensuring himself in the midst of difficulties.
The farmers have also discovered roads in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties, but I am confident that even if there is any difficulty and natural calamities, it will always be a bigger moment.
Small traders of our country, who also provide jobs, also increase economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers of villages like Mall will be able to do their business for twenty-four hours now, no law can stop them because I believed that if the elders get 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the village get it
A major initiative has been taken to provide loans to them from the Mudra Yojana.
Lacs of crores of rupees have been provided to such small people because a large number of people do business and give a boost to the business of billions.
But it is natural that this decision will also make them difficult.
You can also download the bank's app in mobile phones.
You should also set up a POS machine for credit card and learn how to do business without a note.
Technology roads are safe and quick.
I would like you to help in making this campaign successful and not only lead the change but I am confident that you can lead the change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the business of the entire village.
I also want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a footprint on the paper and when it comes in hand, it is different.
Sometimes there is a sufficient quantity and sometimes there is a rise outside it has to be given some part and the labourers have to make this absorption a part of life.
With this new system, we would like to share your money in the bank so that the minimum wages are maintained.
Nowadays, your mobile phones also work as e-packets - you can also pay the money from the same mobile phones that you have to buy from the small shops of the neighborhood.
Therefore, I urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because finally, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, farmers, labourers, the deprived and the victims of this scheme which they should get.
Today, I especially want to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 percent population below 35 years of age.
Youth and youngsters of my country, I know that my decision would have been liked by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are also contributing sufficiently to this matter.
But brothers, you are my true soldier, you are my true partner.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati, and the opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can you help me with my youngsters
You'll help me, you're not gonna stop talking.
The more experience you have in today's world, the older generation is not as much.
It may be that your family does not know the elder brother and parents, Kaka-Kaki and mother-in-law may not be aware.
You know what is the app, you know what is the online banking. You know how online ticket booking is done.
All these things are very common for you and you also use it, but today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of 'Keshles Society'.
100 percent of the case society is not possible but will India start the 'Lass Case Society'
Once today, if we start the 'Lass Case Society' then the condition of the Cases Society will not be far away and I will see your physical help in it, you will see your time and you will see your resolve.
And I am confident that you will never disappoint me because we all want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You are aware that today there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for the case society.
Each bank provides online facility.
The direct meaning of the volume is e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and the RuPay cards used to be used very little after 8th.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and there has been an increase of about 300.
Likewise, print cards are available in mobile phones, print cards are available for spending money in banks.
A good platform is the UPI of doing business through which you can also buy, you can also send money, you can also get money and this work is as easy as you can send on the Whatsapp.
How to send a message on the WhatsApp to the person who is uneducated.
Not only this, technology will become so easier that there is no need for any big smartphone for this work.
Each bank has got it and now it has also been eradicated the cost of online surcharges and it has also been seen that in 2-4 days, every expenditure has been eradicated in Akhbar so that the cashless society's movement is strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unfamiliar with it.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
As the creative messages you have sent on the Whatsapp, I see all these things, poems, poems, cartoons and innovative imaginations, and in the midst of the difficulties, it seems that this India is the specialty of the soil that the songs were born in the battlefield at some time, similarly today we have been passing through the times of such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, I again say that I want your help and I am confident that crores of youngsters of my country will do this.
You should do a job, from now on, you will become a part of yourself for 'Keshles Society'.
All the technologies you have to spend online on your mobile phones are available.
Not only this, about half an hour or two hours a day, what is this technology for at least 10 families, how to use this technology, how to download their bank's app and how to spend the money in your accounts to the shopkeeper
Teach the shopkeepers how to do business
You voluntarily have to lead this campaign to bring out the circumstance of these newspapers, the campaign to make the country corruption free, the campaign to free black money, the campaign to make people free of problems and problems.
Once the use of RuPay card is done to the people, the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens learn this system then they will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India get involved in this work then I don't think it will take more time.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and this work can be done through your mobile phone.
It can be done by going to 10 houses every day and adding 10 houses to it.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we will be the soldiers of this change and will continue to change.
We will move ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there is a rich country in the world where youngsters have changed the lives of that country and they will have to believe that those changes bring the youth, they revolutionize.
Kenya, he used the technologies of M-PESA, named M-PESA and today the entire trade in this area of Africa has come to its fore.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to do this work in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, individually.
We will take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the best of the country, which is not to lose opportunities.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country, Shri Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today, on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Smt.
It must have been noticed that the most popular artist of this century, Amitabhaji, is taking forward the cleanliness drive very well.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in his nurses and that is why he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So, his son, Shriman Amitabhaji, who is running a mission of cleanliness in his nurses, has written to me using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My identity.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also express my gratitude to Shriman Amitabhaji for connecting the Mann Ki Baat in this way and pursuing the work of hygiene.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings and your letters have always linked me with you on MYGOV, Narendra Modi App.
Now there are 11 words of Mann Ki Baat, but then we will soon start in regional languages.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiatives that have been made by those people who will definitely get the opportunity to connect with the people of my country where Hindi language is not prevalent.
Thank you very much.
Those who see from far-off places feel as if Indians are the second name of the festival of life and they are also natural.
The festivals that have been traditionally in India since the Vedic period have been a festival to bring about changes in time.
We have seen the courage to finish the tradition of external festivals from time to time and changes in the festivals as per the demand of time and society have also been easily accepted.
And it's through this festival.
Our ancestors have taken up all these matters in a very scientific manner.
This whole world is discussing the environment and natural destruction has become a matter of concern.
India's festival tradition is going to strengthen nature lovers, from child to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has a festival of responsibility.
Nowadays we keep a holiday on Sundays, but those who are old generations, those who are labourers, fishermen etc.
That is, we have also developed the tradition of keeping the holidays there integrated with Brahman and Science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educational festival.
We all know that we go to any corner of India, come from Amir to Amir's house, go to the hut of poorest of the poor, in the festivals of Deepawali, in every family, a campaign of cleanliness is being seen.
The corner of the house is cleaned.
But the need of the hour is not only the cleanliness of our houses but also the cleanliness of the entire campus, the cleanliness of the entire village.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepavali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepavali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, even the Parliament and the rulers there have started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is eastern or west, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the smoke of Deepavali is visible.
You all will be aware that the US postal service of America has also released the postal stamp of Deepawali this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his discourse on the switching of lights on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Britain organised this celebrations to connect all the society in London on Diwali, he himself took part in it and perhaps U.
And what is the question
16 women MPs from Singapore have worn out of Parliament wearing Indian saddle and these pictures have been viralized.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Now the festival of Deepavali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia has conveyed his greetings to the Indian community on the occasion of Deepavali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said that I have to return so soon that I am going to attend the Deepawali celebrations. I mean that the festival of Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration to take the world community from dark to light.
On the occasion of Deepavali, there is a lot of smoke in clothing, eating and drinking.
And the children and the youth are very happy.
Does not keep in mind what is happening around .
On the days of Diwali, news of accidents, news of anguish, news of deaths are highly concerned.
And there is a problem that doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers on the day of Diwali.
The festival of Deepavali is very long in our country.
It's not just a day.
It has been a long time since Govardhan Pooja, Brothers and sisters, say Beneficiaries, and take them to the light of Kartik Purnima.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Deepavali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a very big festival in the eastern regions of India.
But one of its specialty is that it gives a lot of intensive messages to the society.
But it is said that people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival in which the worship of the setting sun is also done.
There is a very big social message in this festival...
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali that I would like to convey my best wishes to you all this time.
But there is also a special time for me.
I am particularly grateful to the people of the country, and thank you.
In the events that have been taking place in the last few months, our army is looting its entire world for our well-being.
The sacrifices, penance and hard work of the security forces of the soldiers on my future world continues to exist.
And one of these things was in mind to dedicate to the Deepavali Defence Forces.
I invited the people of the country for a campaign called message to society.
But today I would like to bow down my head and say that there will be no such belief in India that the unprecedented love for the people of the country is proud of the army and the way it has emerged is powerful to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces as a message of your pride has emerged as impossible.
Whether it is school or college, students, villages, businessmen, shopkeepers, sportspersons, sportspersons or cinematographers, fortunately somebody who has not given a message to the country's soldiers, the media has also changed the opportunity to express gratitude to the soldiers and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, Water Services, Landlines, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot call everyone's name, but what kind of trouble do we have to go to this place
I can imagine how proud this moment is for the people of my country.
All such acts have come on the message to solvers' healthteg, what do we talk in the immune form
I want to read that Sriman Ashwinikumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Such sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message and what do we say to the Fauzi family
I bow down to Shiva, Prime Minister of Namaskar.
Our foster brothers are getting a lot of boost from the message that has been launched by this Deepavali.
I am from a troop family.
My wife is also the officer of the Army.
My father and mother-in-law have been officers of both armed forces.
So we are filled with the entire family.
I want to say that along with the officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also offer good sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers are not only on the border but also on every frontier of life.
Be it natural calamity or be it the contract of law and order or be it intimidation of the oppression or be it the courage to revert the youngsters on the wrong path, our youth continues to work with nationalism on every aspect of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defection free.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is also going to be formed in the first November.
But how can these successes be seen
Now our ITBP jawans had gone to villages in their holidays on their own.
So perhaps there was a need to meet the village council at that time and it was being discussed in the village council.
It was learned that some families could not make toilets due to lack of money.
This wave should be forgotten, and their patriotic views should not be that he used to serve the country only to put pills on the enemies.
He distributed seventeen thousand rupees from his chequebook and gave it to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those 5 households who do not have toilets, give one thousand rupees to every family on behalf of me. Make 5 toilets and make our villages free from open defecation.
I am really grateful to the youth.
I remember that in the far-flung forests of Kerala, wherever there is no road, when the entire day walks, it can be reached with difficulty.
It is difficult to reach the tribal panchayat Idmalakudi, that is, people didn't go anywhere, it was taken into account by the students of engineering in the nearby urban areas that they had to make toilets in this village.
Candidates of NCC, youth of NSS, students of engineering, all together decided that we will make toilets.
He took the bricks, cements and all the commodities that were to be taken to make toilets and he went to Pella wilderness on foot all day.
He laboured and made toilets in the village and these youth freed such a small village in the remote forest.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 municipalities Open Defecation Free.
10 districts have also been declared free of open defecation.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on November 1 and he has decided that in a few months the entire state will be opened.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I congratulate the citizens of all these states for joining this great work and contributing to eradicating the dirty darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there are many schemes in the government and after the first scheme, if there is another good scheme then the first scheme has to be left out.
But generally, no one pays attention to these things.
Old schemes are also underway and new schemes are also underway and waiting for the upcoming schemes.
This continues.
In our country, the households that have gas connections, the households that have electricity, do not need kerosene.
Those families who have gas connections, those who have electricity, have been fulfilled from the base number and I have heard that now seven or eight districts have been free of kerosene.
I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene free.
And people will also be able to facilitate. Yes, there will be trouble, the middlemen will have trouble.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always guiding for all of us.
What should the country go
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan then first remember the poor and weak face and then decide whether the poor will get any benefit from what you are going to do or not
You decide on the basis of these parameters.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes of the poor people of the country.
To get rid of the difficulties, we have to take one step after another.
Whether it is our old thinking, the society has to be freed from the discrimination of the daughter-in-law.
There are 21st century and there are darkness in the village.
And that is why the magnificence of providing electricity to the villages is progressing successfully to make the villages free from darkness.
Time is moving in the boundaries.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mother and the smoke of 4000 cigarettes in a day by cooking a kitchen on the wooden pool
Such five crore families are moving ahead with success in providing smoke-free life.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, sellers, vegetables, milk-driven shopkeepers, princes used to be stuck in the grip of interest.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October, the great man of this country has shown the unity of India who made the mantra of his life.
On 31st October is the festival of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the life of the country's unity is a great man.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We should not only remember the purity of the great men but also do it.
But I also touched the phone and pain of one of the people of Punjab, Prime Minister Namaskar, sir, I am speaking Jasdeep.
From Punjab, sir, you know that on 31st date Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is.
Sardar Patel is a spirit that has spent his entire life connecting the country and I feel that he has succeeded in this zeal.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
The successful effort to bring the freedom fighters down to a flag, the great Bhagirath work that was done by the Mahapuru is a 100th bowl to the great man.
However, this is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, was hunting for unity, because of their priorities of unity, but he did not forget the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of this great man who lives for unity, and on the birth anniversary of Sardar, we all suffer from oppression.
But we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity in the midst of these conflicts.
Unity in diversity is the strength of that country.
Languages, species, wears, food habits, but unity in diversity is the strength of India.
The root cause of unity is a strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's journey of life started with a struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sometimes many of us hear the name of Amul.
Every manufacturing of Amul is familiar with India and India.
But very few people would know that it was Sardar Saheb's divine vision which had imagined a cooperative milk producing union.
And in the Kheda district which was called 'Kera' district at that time, and in 142, he gave strength to this idea.
This is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for the farmers of today's Amul.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on this unity day, on 31st October, wherever we may be, remember Sardar Saheb and resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, this series of Deepawali festivals is also a celebration of Kartik Purnima (Deepawali).
Guru Nanak Dev, his wisdom is a guide for the entire humanity, not just for India but for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and harmony, this was the basic mantra.
When we were at the height of touching, caste, height and deformity, Guru Nanak Dev was chosen as brothers and sisters.
Come, if we have to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev gave us the light, the inspiration to leave the discrimination, then Guru Nanak Dev can be our guidance.
I salute Guru Nanak Dev, who is also on his birth anniversary.
My dear countrymen, once again the name of the country's soldiers is this Deepavali, this Deepavali also greets you all.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we have lost 18 brave dreams of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was sufficient to surprise the entire country.
There is also condolences and anger in the country and this is not only the fault of those families who have lost their daughters, brothers and sisters, this fault has come to the entire country.
My dear countrymen, we are confident of our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians, we also speak.
But the army doesn't speak, the army shows the sequence.
I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well as in a special way.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the impossible people against the country.
And as we have started understanding the facts, they have come out on the path of peace by dissolving such elements.
Every parents want to work as soon as they become schools and colleges, the farmers are also feeling that their crops, fruits etc. have been prepared in the markets across India.
Economic activity also works well.
And for the last few days, the business has also started to walk well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are our problems, our progress is also a path of development.
We have to reach new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we will find a solution to every problem, take the path and paving the way for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of this government.
Governance has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will fully follow it.
And sometimes those who think of the ideas that we think, they also present innovative ideas.
Today, I have the opportunity to know a lot in the social media.
From every corner of India, there is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it strengthens the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named 11th standard Harsh Vardhan had a different idea before me.
He wrote, I was very busy after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there is no way to do something and what can be done by a small student like me
Out of this, I was wondering how to work for the country's interest.
And I promised that I would study 3 hours a day.
The country will become the right citizen to work.
It is a matter of great pleasure for me that brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age, you can think healthyly.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger that is in the minds of the people of the country is very much valued.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
But you would be aware that when the 1965 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and there was such a passion throughout the country, anger and patriotism.
Everybody wanted to do something or something or the other.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this sentiment of the country.
He inspired the people of the country to work for the country by giving a mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had shown that there is another way to express patriotism between the voices of Bomb and Banduk.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also running the freedom movement, when the movement was at a rapid pace and there was a need for sustainability in the movement, he used to make the pace of the movement very successful in turning it towards creative work in the society.
All of us will be able to fulfil our obligations, the people sitting in the armed forces will fulfil their duties and we will surely make our country a new height if we contribute to the spirit of our countrymen, every citizen and this patriot.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who had gone to Paralympics have created history and their sight is a victory of human emotion.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a very good job and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, every person in the country has had an emotional link to our players of parallels.
Perhaps, our perspective of humanity, our perspective towards Divyangs has been completely changed by moving ahead of sportspersons and sportspersons.
This sentence has a great strength.
This time, 1 players, including 3 women from our country, participated in the parallel.
When Divyangs play in comparison to other sportspersons, physical capabilities, sports skills, it is a big deal.
He won the second Gold Medal in Bhalafank, Devendra Jhazria, who won the Gold Medal and also won it 12 years later.
Once Gold Medal wins, the zeal also decreases.
But Devender said that the condition of the body or the increase in age could not weaken his vision and he brought gold to the second time after 12 years.
And he was not Divyang from birth.
He had to lose his hand due to the electric harvest.
You think, those people who will get the first gold medal at the age of 23 and get the second gold medal at the age of 35, they will have done so much in their lives.
Having won the Gold in high jumps.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg at the age of only 5.
Poverty also did not come to the forefront of their resolve.
He neither lives in a big city nor from the middle class Amir family.
In spite of passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, he also empowered the country with imagination in the midst of physical problems.
With the name of Deepa Malik of sportspersons, the pride of sportspersons has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati won bronze medals in high quality.
These medals of the Paralympics are not only important but these medals have done a great job in our country, in our society, in our neighborhood and in our divyang brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities have not only changed but our vision to look at these Divyangjans.
Very few people will be aware of how these Divyangjans have done their best in this period of parallel.
A few days ago, the Olympics competition took place in the same place.
This time it has become.
Abdellatif Baka of Algeria, who won the Gold Medal in the 1500 meter run in the Olympics competition, broke the 1500 metres of competition for the Persons with Disabilities with Disabilities for a short span of 1500 metres.
Moreover, I was surprised that the fourth number of Divyangjans had not received any medal as a runner but they were also running in less than those who won the Gold in the general runners' competition.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for its development and development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
There was a lot of emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp of the Government of India was set up for Divyangjans and set up a vast number of world records.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book and the book has collected successful stories of some Divyangjans.
There were very inspirational incidents.
The world records on the soil of India and innovation, which I consider as important.
It was successfully used to gather in the ears of six hundred Divyangjans who could not hear them within eight hours.
He was ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to set up three world circulars by Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Poojaya Bapu.
And on that day I had said that we should become a habit of cleanliness and every citizen should become a duty.
I can assure you that there has been an increase in awareness about cleanliness in the lives of millions of people of the country when it is taking place on October 2, 2019.
And I said that one step towards cleanliness, today we all can say that everyone has tried to move one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved towards hygiene.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
Its results are so good and some such efforts have also seen what happens.
Be it bus stations or railways, school or colleges, religious places, hospitals, everybody, children to old people, villages, poor, farmers, women and all are contributing to cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
We still have to go a long way.
For health, for the honour of citizens, especially for the honour of mothers and sisters, the cottage to go to the open should be stopped.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in a very close future towards freeing from the habit of opening trees.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officers told me that the Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will complete the goal of ODF on this second October.
I want to present a scheme especially for young friends who use technology in abundance.
Everybody has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
On this 16 number, you will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city but you will also be able to make toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Not only this, a Swachhata App has been launched to know the condition of cleanliness related problems and disposal of complaints.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
This Swachhta Abhiyan will not be a matter of fact even if it is limited to the world.
If hygiene becomes a habit then it is not enough.
It should be used to ensuring waste financing and for this, the government has also started a policy process.
The fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost-central fertilizer from the waste.
And the farmers who want to go to livelihood reach this surety.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, concern the health of the earth, ask for prevention of such a good loss due to chemical fertilizers, if such fertilizers are required in some quantity, then the companies give them such guarantees.
And Shriman Amitabha Bachan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite the youth to develop such instruments, develop such technologies, work as affordable products from waste to waste.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special event Indonesian-India Sanitation Council is also being organized.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, mayors, commissioners from all over the country, all of them have to concentrate deeply on cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic infrastructure
How can people partnership be done
How to increase employment opportunities in this
All issues are to be discussed.
And I am looking at the fact that there are innovative information about cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University launched a awareness campaign to build toilets by going to 10 villages.
He himself laboured and contributed to making about thousands of toilets.
A few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Vingakmandar Paramveer Singh, a group of people traveled from Devprayag to Gangasagar, traveled from 2800 kms and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a calendar time sheet throughout the year in its own departments.
Each department will focus on cleanliness in 15 days especially.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development will work together to enhance sanitation in their respective sectors from 1st to 15th October in the coming month.
And during the last two weeks of October 16th October to 31st October, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, these three departments will conduct a sanitation drive in the areas connected to them for 15 days.
It must have been noticed that the Swachhata Survekshan is also underway.
First of all, the report was presented to the people of the country on the condition of cleanliness by surveying 3 cities.
Now there are more than 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and there is a belief in every city that let us remain behind, but for the next time we will do something good.
Cleanliness has become a competition environment.
I hope that all the citizens can contribute to this campaign.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also going on for two years.
I urge the Khadi to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Deepavali.
This time also I urge that every family should have some or the other piece of fertilizer so that the light of Diwali can be lighted in the house of the poor.
As a citizen on Sunday, how can we join ourselves in the work of hygiene
If you have a video then send a video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again get new strength and new momentum.
Remembering the purity of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, the promises made by the people of the country are an inspirational event of India's national life.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the segments and used to ask for donations to the old players and those players who used to donate bats to the courtyards of the poor areas.
You must have seen the wonderful pleasure that the poor kids were enjoyed by watching pella sports.
Millions of workers like me have been working with political ideals to describe the political ideals, the party of the politics associated with the roots of India and the ideals that have given a political philosophy, the solitary human philosophy, the centenary of Pandit Deendayal ji's centenary of today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitay- Sarvajan Sukhai Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke of the welfare of the last person.
How to get the fruits of development to the poorest of the poor
They gave full economic work to every hand, water to every field in two words.
When the country celebrates his birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, the attention of the governments of the society and the benefits of development will be concentrated to the poor, then we can deliver the country from poverty.
As part of this, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya has been named Lok Kalyan Marg on the birth centenary year, where the Prime Ministers residence and the path which was known as the Rescuers Road of the modern British.
This is a symbolic form of this centuries poor welfare year.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Vijayadashmi, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
I have been trying to prove that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to calculate that government work.
How is the man of this country inspiring me
Is the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the sages for the manner in which Mann Ki Baat had made amends and blessed him when two years are going to be completed this week.
I am also grateful to Akashwani, who has not only spread these words but has also made a decisive effort to reach it in all languages.
I am also grateful to the people of the country who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and published the windows of the government by informing them.
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not only a 15-20-minute conversation but also a new opportunity to change society.
What other reason can be the satisfaction of anybody more than this
My dear countrymen, in the coming weeks, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijaya Dashmi, the preparations for Deepavali are a different kind of environment in the entire country.
It is a festival of unsuccessful advocacy and the unity of the society is capable of the country.
And how is that Navaratri or Durga Puja, the festival of worshipping the unity of the society
How to make festivals connecting humanity
And that is the means of realisation, we can celebrate victory together.
Let us take the mantra of unity.
PM's Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Hockey magician Dhyanchand ji.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also to remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in winning Hockey in the Olympic Games in 128th, 132nd, 1936.
We also know the name of all cricket lovers, breadmen.
He said for Dhyanchand ji, this score is a living example of Goal Light Rans, Dhyanchand ji Sportsmen Sports and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, a opponent team player hocked on the head of Dhyanchand ji.
At that time, the match was only 10 minutes to be completed.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three rounds in ten minutes and said that I have changed the wound.
But I saw that this time, everybody urged me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I look forward to so much awakening of the common citizens towards the Rio Olympics, and to pressurize the country's masses, or to speak about it.
Besides cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports.
Reading this message for me also became a cause of inspiration in itself.
One Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App. Please speak at Mann Ki Baat on education and their participation in sports, because he has honoured the country by winning medals in Rio Olympics.
Some Shriman Secretary writes that you are requested to mention the mention of Sindhu, witness and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
These girls gave us the medals that we got.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not descend from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India, one from South India, and another from East India.
Someone is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of all India have gained momentum to make the name of the country proud.
Summit on May Goa has written that we could have performed well in the Olympics.
He has written, Honble Modi sir, first of all congratulated us for winning two medals in Rio, but I want to draw your attention towards whether our performance was really good.
And the answer is: No.
We need to cut a great distance in sports.
Our parents still want to pay attention to reading.
Even today, sports in society is considered to be the widespread of time.
We need to change this idea.
The society needs inspiration.
Thus, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
Nobody can deny that we cannot perform our hopes in accordance with our hopes.
It also happened that our sportspersons who used to showcase the exhibitions in India cannot reach there.
And only two medals can be found in the medals.
But it is also true that despite not getting the medal, for the first time in many sports, India's players have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that she is the first Indian girl to qualify for Olympics and Olympic Financial.
Something similar happened in Tennis with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar made a qualifying for Track Field Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, women hockey team reached the Olympics.
Indias sportspersons, the coming time will certainly be better for us.
Many sportspersons, such as Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do the same then perhaps we will be restored.
I have announced a committee.
How can we do better, it will be a work map.
Imagine that the king chooses one or two sportspersons and plans how he can perform excellently.
I also urge the sports associations that they also enjoy neutrality.
And I urge every citizen of India to send an instruction on the Narendra Modi App whoever is interested in it.
Write to the government.
I would like to assist the government by discussing the Association.
The State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
But we will be fully prepared and I am confident that we have to move forward with the commitment to achieve a better situation in the world of sports, out of which 65 are young.
My dear countrymen, this is the Teacher's Day on 5th September.
I have been spending a lot of time with students on Teachers' Day for many years.
But this time I have to go to the G20 Summit, so I am sure that today I am expressing my feelings in the matter of mind.
The place of mother in life is as much teachers and we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their students than themselves.
He dedicates his life for his disciples, for his students.
Nowadays, after Rio Olympics, the discussion of Pullela Gopichandra ji is going on.
He is a sportsperson, but he is a good teacher and has presented a vibrant example.
Today, I am looking at Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way to enjoy the success of his students.
The contribution of teachers in our compassionate life is always felt.
On September 5, former President of India, Dr.
All-party is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates it as a teacher day.
He might have reached any place in his life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say that good teachers are those inside whom the student does not die.
Despite being the President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji showed a wonderful life to live as a teacher and to live in the mind of teachers.
I think I remember a lot of my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But I can say with joy that even though one of my teachers is now at the age of 0, his letter comes to me every month.
That's why I see some good letters, so I feel very respected in my mind.
It will be a pride and it is our responsibility to increase the pride of our teachers in society.
If you have an inspirational conversation with your teachers, your photographs, your teachers, on the Narendra Modi App.
Look at the contribution of teachers in the country in view of students, it is also very precious.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want our country, our society, our family and every person's lives to be incomplete.
But when we talk about Ganesh Festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival is a gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now, not only Maharashtra, public Ganesh Festival has started taking place in every corner of India.
Disinvestment competitions, colorful competitions.
The exhibitions that showcase the issues that touch the society in a very artistic manner.
This massive campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh Festival.
Surajya is our birth rights, now we move towards the kingdom, Surajya becomes our priority. Can we not convey this message through public Ganesh Festival
Let me invite you to this.
It is true that the festival is possible for the society.
This time many people have also sent me a lot by writing Ganesha Festival and Durga Puja.
Why do not you use the statue of Ganesha built of the pond of the village
The idols made of POPs are not suitable for the environment.
Conservation of environment, conservation of our rivers and streams, the conservation of these small organisms from the contamination of these waters is also Gods service.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not make Ganesh ji a legislation.
I don't know how you will take this thing, but I don't just say it, many people say it and I have heard about many - a sculptor Shriman Abhijit Ghondafle.
Ganesh Festival is also a social service to the environment.
Durga Puja is still time.
Now we decide that the old family that makes the statues.
If you buy idols from them, they will also get employment and these idols will be made from the pond or the soil of the river then they will be found in it again.
You all have to convey the best wishes of the Ganesh Festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madhur Teresa will be distributed by the Saints on 4th September.
Madhur Teresa dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when the Madar Teresa, who served the poor of India, gets the title of Saints.
On 4th September, the Government of India will also send an official delegation to our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of hundreds of crore Indians.
From the saints, from the sages, from the great men, we have to learn something or the other every moment.
We keep getting something, keep learning and keep doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how much change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Jansh Kith is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India in collaboration with five state governments in the past has made a successful effort to connect the people for clean Ganga and clean Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, the Sarpanches of the village on the bank of the Ganges were invited in Allahabad.
The village does not allow the river Ganga to be dirty and no one came from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
Somebody came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody from Bihar, somebody from Jharkhand, somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India for fulfilling this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in the sanitation of the Ganges by connecting the people.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me a lot and those who are imagining them also have special respect in my mind.
On 15th July, more than seventy-seven school students in Kabir Dham district collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Children from seven to seventy years of age have done this work.
Congratulations to those students who have made this effort and especially congratulated those parents who decided to make their children's letters seriously and make toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
Mallamma, a sixteen-year-old girl in Koppal district of Karnataka, has respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a pledge.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
But everybody is somehow connected to it and everybody is contributing to it.
Every day there is news about how new efforts are being made.
There has been a thought in the Government of India and has urged people to make a film of two minutes and three minutes on hygiene and send this short film to the Government of India.
You will get the details on the website.
The competition will be held and the award will be given to the winners on the 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti.
I would also like to urge the channels to compete for such films.
Creativeism - creativity can also give a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
You will know new ways, you will get new inspiration and all this will be done by the common artists from the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be big studio and good cameras for making films.
A very important thing happened in the last few days.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Matri Channel - now some people will have to inaugurate a radio channel.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So, on the other hand, he will share the commodities of Akashwani friendship and on the other hand Bangladeshi people from both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
I also express my gratitude to Bangladesh that they have joined us for this work.
I also congratulate Akashwani's friends that he is also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even though you have given me the task of a big Prime Minister, I believe that I am yours.
And sometimes all the emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy and inspire them to leave something or the other for the people of Barat.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my mind.
A mother of about 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote to me this letter.
Had he never refused to declare my name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In the letter, he wrote that whenever you appealed to leave the gas subsidy, I had left the subsidy and then I had forgotten it.
Ladies and gentlemen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives go back to the paper.
I am trying to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job, the campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of limestone is the best and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not of fifty thousand rupees but of the feelings of the mother and the blessings of such Kotikoti mothers and sisters, which gets trust and strength for the future of my country.
I salute those mothers and also salute those Kotikoti mothers of India who always wish somebody by suffering.
My dear countrymen, last year we were suffering due to drought but this month of August was constantly filled with flood problems.
There were floods in some parts of the country.
The central government, the local self-institutions, the social institutions, the citizens could do as much.
But among the news of this flood, there were also some news that needed to be remembered.
The month of August this year will be remembered for what is the strength of unity and how big results can be achieved together.
In August 2016, all the political parties, including nearly 0 parties, in the Parliament, have passed the GST legislation.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country spoke of Kashmir in a single voice in connection with the situation of Kashmir.
If it has been said in at least words then I would say that unity and mother-in-law these two things remained in the original mantra and we all believe that one hundred and a half crore people believe that if anybody dies in Kashmir, if anybody dies or is a young man or a security worker, this is our own loss.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
In order to bind the country full of diversity into the bonds of unity, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to give more emphasis on those things that we can strengthen unity and bring out only then the country will be able to make its bright future.
My homes are confident of the achievements of millions of people.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today morning I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi and I touch my mother or in the coming days, the color of sports will be filled with zeal and zeal for every young man across the country.
We all know that in a few days, the greatest sports events in the world are going to be organized.
The word Rio will repeat in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
Every country in the world will be keeping an eye on the performance of its sportspersons.
Our expectations are very much but those who have gone to play in Rio have the task of enhancing the enthusiasm of the sportspersons.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a holistic run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khelo.
We all have to do something for the promotion of our sportspersons wherever we may be in the coming days.
The food hates however, but everything has to be left.
Even if there is a sweet salt in the winter, you have to leave the bed and run into the field and not only to the player but also to his parents.
Sportspersons don't become night and night.
I am also ready to do this work from you.
The country's largest postal post is ready to deliver your messages to these players.
Come, let us enhance the pride of every player in the coming days.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student of Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
There may be many other poets who may have sent poems, maybe they will write poems but maybe they are true.
Technologies keep changing every day, make new forms everyday, make new impacts everyday, it keeps changing.
You can't catch technology.
If there is no research and innovation then the way the seawater spreads dirt, the technology also becomes weak.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation, then we will become out of the changing era of the world and that is why in a new generation we have to enhance the spirit of science, research and innovation towards science.
Atal Innovation Mission is being encouraged by NITI Aayog.
The aim is to create an ecosystem, innovation, experiment, entrepreneurship, and thereby enhancing employment opportunities through AIM-All Innovation Mission.
Similarly, innovation is directly related to the Incubation Centre.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then the government is thinking of giving a big amount of Rs. 10 crore.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And, through the Atal Grand Challenge, the youth of the country have urged you to find, research, innovate and bring solutions to the problems faced by you.
The Government of India seeks to give special prizes to the technologies that have been discovered to address our problems.
And I am glad that when we talk about the Tinkering Lab, about thirteen thousand schools have served and when we talk about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions have come forward for the Incubation Centres.
I am confident that Abdul Kalam ji will work as much as our new generation to simplify the problems of research and innovation in our daily life.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worrying about the times and now rains are also enjoying and the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to help the flood victims in a big way.
Everybody's mind, every person's mind gets sufficient due to rains, because the center of our entire economic activity is in rains.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us busy throughout the life.
But if we are aware, be careful, if we are trying then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
He took Dengu.
Dengue can be avoided.
Beware of a little cleanliness, beware and try to stay safe, pay special attention to children and such a disease occurs in the poor population but the case of dengue does not come.
Dengu first comes to the well-known region and therefore we understand it.
You must have been watching the public news on TV but sometimes we are very eager to take precautionary steps by becoming aware of it.
The government, the hospital, the doctor will do his job but I will pray to you that we will not enter the dengue in our houses, our families and there will be any disease due to water.
On the other hand, I would like to pay attention to your dear countrymen.
Life has become so busy, it has become so busy that we have no time to think for us.
If you have fallen sick then you feel that you are cured at the earliest and for this you take any antibiotic in your body.
But the bacteria that are herds are prevented from these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then in fighting against these bacteria , making new medicines , scientific research etc . years are spent and till then these diseases produce new problems .
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves that medicines do not have any effect on them .
In medical language, it is called antibiotic remedies and therefore it is important to follow the rules of using antibiotics.
When the matter of health comes out, I want to add one more thing.
Though in the last decade, the rate of maternal mortality has decreased, but still a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or the deficiency of blood , infection related to delivery , high BP , do not know when the problem of her life is bad .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Safe Maternity Abhiyan, all pregnant women will be examined free of cost at Government Health Centres on 9th of every month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
In the past, many letters have been written to me.
Thousands of doctors have taken forward my words.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should be added to this campaign.
I am sure you must join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the war of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Sri Krishna says, 'Swath: Sarva Vrikshana', I am peeping in all trees.
The Shukracharya policy says, NASTI MULAN ANUSHADHASHANDHATI ANOUSHATION: There is no medicinal properties.
The Anushan Parv of Mahabharata - it has been discussed in a lot of way and it says that the trees that wear are sacred for it.
There's no doubt.
Those who donate trees, they also bear the trees in the world like children.
A few days ago, I found an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, which touched my mind.
It is said in the advisory festival of Mahabharata that the trees also fulfill the responsibility of the children in the world.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village, married his grandson Sonal in a very inspirational manner in Pune, Maharashtra.
And when I saw his discovery in the social media, I was surprised that there were no animals in marriage but the plants were seen all around.
It was a vision of Tasvir.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an incomplete story of nature love and I congratulate Sonal and Mr.
And many people use this kind of thing.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I would like to tell them that if you want to make this leave of your village bigger then the mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pilgrims used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed this year.
The temples can also start the tradition of planting instead of palaces in this rainy season.
A simple mass movement can be plantation.
Why shouldn't we cultivate timber instead of that swad that swaddle which we make on the banks of our fields
If we plant trees on the banks of our farms that are furniture and households then it can be sold after fifteen-twenty years by the government's permission.
And it can be a new instrument of your income and India can also be saved from importing timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan-Marubhoomi has celebrated such a big festival and has resolved to plant fifty lakh plants.
25 lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those people who know the land of Rajasthan know how big the bead has been raised.
It will also increase its green cover by 50.
The Central Government has launched a Green India Mission under which the railways have accelerated this work.
There is also a very bright tradition of One Festival in Gujarat.
This year, in Gujarat, several projects such as Amravan, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van have been taken as One Festival and crores of trees have been launched.
I cannot mention all the states but they are also worthy of congratulations.
But for me the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When you remember South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever this word of non-violence, love and forgiveness falls in the world, the face of Gandhiji and Mandela is swollen.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Financial Settlement, which is known as Mahatma Gandhis residence Sarvodaya.
I also got the privilege of the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had transformed a Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi, the Peter Maritsburg station.
But this time I got the opportunity to meet such dignitaries who have given their lives for equality and equal opportunities, who fought with Nelson Mandela.
For twenty-twenty-two years, he spent his life with Nelson Mandela in jail.
In a way, he sacrificed the entire youth and I was fortunate to see these glorious emotions, Mr. Ahmad Kathada, Mr. Lalu Cheba, Mr.
The symptoms of the duties that have been described in the Gita were absolutely true.
My heart will be remembered forever.
There is no greater mantra for any society and the government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same and the way is development, equality, equality, equality, equality and mother-in-law.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have also shown the basic mantras of our lives in South Africa.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Varma.
Those who have given me the message and their concerns are very natural.
I am sorry to be a woman for her family.
And some people get illusioned and get stuck in money.
A new way of looting through this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments he came to know that everything has been lost.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
The artistic pictures have been drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then you must see the station.
Today, I am receiving such news from many railway stations in India and the local people are presenting their identification of their areas on the walls of the railway station by their art.
I am feeling innovative.
This is an example of how peoples participation can bring about changes.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, my friends of Aligarh have special congratulations.
And you will also be joining the festival at home and outside.
We have a special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, this year on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, cannot you give the mothers and sisters of your country a gift to the big Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Think, give sisters such gifts that give them real protection in their lives.
And this is social security.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born since independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in a free India.
The entire country should be in the color of freedom fighters, once again feel the fragrance of freedom all over the country and the Freedom Festival should not be a government programme but a programme of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should be our festival.
I hope that you too will do something related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Those whom you want to keep your words from the Red Fort so much.
And nowadays the platform of technology is so easy that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programs in the holidays.
And there is a season of orange in the holidays, that is, it is also a feeling that you enjoy orange.
And sometimes it feels that if you get a chance to sleep for a while in the afternoon then it will be better.
But the horrible heat of this time has enjoyed all around.
But I have seen that the citizens also make a lot of efforts.
In many villages, awareness is seen and what is the value of water, those who are suffering from water.
And that is why there is also a sensitivity about water at such places and there is also the activity of doing something.
A few days ago, somebody had told me that the village of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra has taken the water as a very sensitive question of the village.
The crops that used to use the most water, then it is sugarcane or banana, it has been decided to leave the farming of such crops.
It looks very easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
And all of them went on the farming of plantations and vegetables that require minimum water.
They have taken all such initiatives in the field of fountains, drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, water conservation, that today the village has emerged on its own strength to deal with the water constraints.
I am talking about a small village in the market but there will be many such villages.
I also express my gratitude to all such villagers for their best work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorava Gram Panchayat in Dess district in Madhya Pradesh.
The Commission launched a campaign to create slopes by making efforts.
Although water remains saved, but if water falls on the surface then the quality of water also improves.
Sometimes it seems that whenever the Indian government provided water to Latur by train, it became a news for the world.
It is true that the speed that the railways have done this is eligible for congratulations, but the people of Pela village are also eligible for congratulations.
I would like to say that more than the railways are worthy of congratulations.
However, there are many schemes that are run by the citizens.
There is a nature of a person, even though many problems pass through, but some good news comes from which it feels as if the entire crisis has gone away.
This year, the possibility of rainfall from 106 percent to 110 percent has been reported, as if a message of great peace has come.
Now it is time to come to rain but good rain news also brought a new consciousness.
It gives us a chance as much as the news provides. It gives a chance to all of us.
Can we run a campaign to save the village water
The farmers need soil, the crops are being grown in the fields.
This time why do not we take soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
This will also improve the land of the field and also increase the storage capacity of the ponds.
Whether the water can be stopped in the cement bags or in the empty fertilizer bags, by filling stones and soil from where the water is coming from
If the water will stop for five days, if the water will stop for seven days then the water will fall into the ground.
Our wells will have water.
The water should be stopped as much as possible.
Whether it is a water crisis or a dry situation, but we have time for the next one and a half months.
And I always say that whenever we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, there is also a place in which we want to see how hundreds of years old tablets have been built under the house to save rain water and how clean the water remains in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come, many schemes have been constructed and costs have also been spent. That is why it is very natural to raise this question in the minds of crores of people like Bhai Kumarakrishna.
The Ganga is Mokshadayi for those who have religious faith.
I will accept this greatness but more than that I feel that the Ganges is life-style.
The Ganga gives us a new strength to live by the Ganga.
As the Ganges flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activity of the country.
One Bhagirathi has brought the Ganges but crores of Bhagirathis need to be saved.
This work cannot be successful without public participation.
And that is why we all have to become representatives of cleanliness, change, repeated and repeated.
A lot of efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from the states that are situated on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent the supply and industrial pollution.
Every day, a large number of drains are drained into the Ganges through dense waste.
In order to clean this kind of waste, Trash Skiller works to clean swimming waste in water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been distributed to all local NGOs and have been urged to continue to run and clean the waste from there.
And, in the past, I have been told that there is a lot of effort that waste is removed from three to 11 tons per day.
The waste or blacklicker from the pulp and paper industry is almost completely closed.
All this indicates that we are moving in the right direction and awareness is also increasing.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he says that Saheb, Ganga will be cleaned.
So this is the belief of the people that will definitely succeed in the cleanliness of the Ganges.
People are also donating donations for the sanitation of Ganga.
This system is being run in a very good way.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, gradually, the Panchayati Raj system is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
And therefore, in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India launched Bharatoday Abhiyan from 14th April to 24th April, 10th April.
And today on 24th, I will be celebrating the Panchayati Raj Day in Jharkhand or in the region where our most tribal brothers and sisters live.
And once again on the occasion of Panchayatiraj Day at 3:00 in the afternoon, I will interact with all the Commissions of the country.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How can democratic institutions be strengthened at the level of the village in every corner of India
How can the villages themselves become self-reliant
How do the villages themselves plan their development
The birth anniversary of the girl should be a festival of the village.
There are many such schemes.
In some villages, there were food donation programmes.
Perhaps in all such villages of India, such a number of programmes have been run together for 10 days.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this.
In a very fundamental way, with innovation, this entire opportunity has been converted into an opportunity for the welfare of the village, for the development of the village and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India.
PM Namaskar
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
For the last several years, there has been a need to improve the education sector.
For example, lack of adequate schools or colleges or lack of quality in education.
Today, if parents have a dream in every family then they are of good education for children.
The idea of home, car, after all.
And the feelings of the people's mind for a country like India are very powerful.
There should be an increase in the concern of teaching children and getting good education.
And the child also becomes aware that I am going to school for this work.
And that is why I would first urge all the girls and parents to talk to the child in detail about the activities being done in the school.
And if something comes to mind then go to school and talk to the teachers.
The opportunity that this is, can also reduce the evils of our education system.
So in a way, it was an attempt to spread education all around.
And that was also necessary.
But now the importance of spreading is more important than that of improving our education.
We have done a very big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
We have to make good education a priority from the literacy campaign.
Entrance, entrance and entrance mantras continued to swing but now the children who have reached school will have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize good education.
However, it is true that there is a need to bring about reforms from the architectural level.
This time you must have seen in the budget that the peanuts have been worked with sweets.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten private universities have been asked to get rid of government restrictions and to come on the path of challenges. Let us tell you what you want to be the highest university.
This scheme has been formulated with the intention of giving them full freedom.
Universities of India can also be a global competition university.
Besides, the importance of education is as important as skills.
Similarly, technology will play a very important role in education.
Distance education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that in a very close future, the results will be seen.
People have been asking me on a subject for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal My Goa.
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi App, and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, there is a lot of importance for sports as well as training for the youth.
So one day I also met that I would talk to you all seven before.
The result was that I recently called a meeting where NCCs were elders, NSS elders, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross, Naheru were from the Youth Centre.
And when I asked him who had met before, he said, "Na's brother, we have organised this kind of first such meeting after our independence.
I have got that benefit in my childhood and I believe that these organisations should give a new life and new strength.
This time I have put some topics before them.
I have told them, Brothers, why should not our youth and all organizations do a very big job of water conservation in this season
What programs can you create to connect the country
What can be the common life of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their functioning and programmes
If you write on my Narendra Modi App, I will deliver it to the right place.
Such a situation will become.
My dear countrymen, I have told you that today we are forced to think about all of us.
I also see it as a matter of shocking people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country was such that in the last few elections, how many party gas cylinders would be given
And every political party felt that if we have to reach the middle class society, then the bottles of gas are a big issue.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize them to reduce subsidy.
And because of this, many committees used to sit in which there were very big proposals for reducing gas subsidy.
Crores of rupees were spent behind these committees.
But the matter used to stay there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But there was no idea outside it.
My countrymen, I am happy to note that I have adopted the third path today.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy layer.
However, it was learned that more than 80 percent of these one crore families were those who opened the distributors there, grew up in queues and finally gave them their pockets.
This event has forced the economists of the country to think newly.
And if the economy of the world will be like this then it will be the result of this kind of economic equations.
They also have to think about the outward event of their ideas.
I especially urge the entire political class to do something that we trust everywhere.
You have never thought that we will get such results.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on those who are sending marks by giving their examinations.
Sometimes I feel that we will declare that there will be no ticket chalk in the route of the railways today.
Every newspaper and News Channel contains bad news.
Is it not good near us in the country with a population of Rs.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that there is only positive news on the back of the newspaper.
He used to keep talking about this.
A few days ago, he also wrote a letter to me. He said, We have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news.
It is the biggest reason for inspiration to improve good news.
It is true that as much as we strengthen goodness, the place for evils will be less.
If the light is lighted, the darkness will be removed, it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has suggested good, but please don't regret me.
Together we all try to make positive and try to speak positively.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can also be the center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people of the world would know that for such a long time crores of people will come to the bank of the river.
For the last two days, I have been watching that many people are uploading the details of the Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India to compete with the State Tourism Department.
Photo competition, and ask people to upload yourself with beautiful photographs.
How the atmosphere will be smooth and people will also be aware of the varieties of the Kumbh Mela.
So it can be done.
Yes, it is true that I had met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and he used to say that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness is there.
People from there also take a message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should also use this Kumbh Mela in providing a message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayati Raj, I will once again meet you in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You will remember that last time I had discussed about a book of lovechand ji's statements and we decided that whatever book we read, we will share with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was watching that a large number of people have distributed information about many books.
I am happy that people are discussing and discussing books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Okay, I will talk to you about some other books.
But I have to acknowledge that now I cannot give too much time to read books.
But one of the benefits is that I have got the opportunity to know about many books that you have sent by writing.
But from the experiences of the last month, I feel that we have to move forward.
Why should we make a permanent Book coordinator on the Narendra ModiApp and whenever we read new books, write and discuss it.
And you can also inform the best name for our Book Corner.
I want this Book's corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
You keep reading, write and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made in water conservation across the country.
People have told information about traditional methods and methods.
The media is also proud of many innovations on water conservation.
Whether it is the government or the NGOs, they are doing something at all the levels of war.
It is heartening to see the strength of the community, it is very happy.
Like at a distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand, in the Arakram village of Oranji block, the enthusiasm that the villagers have shown about water management has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of Ishaan India, Meghalaya, has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy-water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, crop farming is encouraged in which less water is required and farmers are not harmed.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with farmers and inspiring them to get rid of traditional farming and for low water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Several fairs are also organized on the occasion of festivals.
Why don't we use this fair for water conservation
Friends, There are some things in our lives and especially the achievements of children, their achievements, their performances, give us new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children - NIDHI BYPOTU, Manish Joshi, Danshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Ananth Tawari, Prati Nagar, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronitesh Ganguly and herrik Ala-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I say about them.
We all know that cancer is a word by which the whole world is scared.
It seems that deaths are standing at the door, but all these ten children have defeated not only cancer-like fatal diseases in their lives, but have brightened the name of India all over the world.
In fact, this month, the World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports event in which Young Cancer Survey i. e.
The competition organized competitions like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis.
All these ten champions of our country won the medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I am fully confident that you must have been proud of the success of India in space and space - I am talking about Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjay Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Aurobindo Rao, from different parts of the country, many people have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged him to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the vision of space was very good for India.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
There was no more discussion on big and important news like A-SAT at that time in the race for elections.
We had the potential to break the satellite three hundred kilometers away from the A-SAT missile in just three minutes.
India, which achieved this, became the fourth country in the world and now on 22nd July, the entire country was proud that Chandrayaan-2 lifted its footsteps from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me about what two big learnings have been received from Chandrayaan-2 then I will say that these are two learnings - Feath and Firelessness.
We must rely on our talents and capacities, we must rely on our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely in Indian color.
It is Indian as a cause and emotion.
It is completely a indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-Be in a virtuous time, by resolving all the technological problems day and night.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists.
We have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the ability to overcome it.
I hope that Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
Finally, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September, when the lander Vikram and rover-progress will be landed on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youth of the country for a quiz competition.
Indias space mission, science and technology will be the key topics of this quiz competition, such as what to do to quit the rocket.
How the satellites are set up in the room and what information we get from the satellite, what is the A-SAT.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make them interesting, interesting and memorable with their participation.
I urge the schools, girls, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools successful.
Encouraging all students to join it and the most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the highest quality students from every State to Sriharikota at its cost and in September, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan is descending on the surface of the moon.
These victorious students will have this historic event of their lives.
But for this, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to get the highest mark and you will be successful.
Friends, You must have lost my suggestions - this is a pleasant opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have recorded one thing.
The words of our minds have accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for sanitation have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, launched five years ago, is setting up new standards for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness but the way the cleanliness campaign has been successful from the ODF to the public places, it is the strength of the vision of one hundred and thirty crore people, but we do not have to stop it.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the media about Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team.
Yogesh is the engineer of the army and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti.
He said that some time ago, Delhi was not just clean, but it was too fast to make it beautiful.
He started with his team with the waste of Lodhi Garden.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of over bridges and schools to the huts, he began to decorate his town and the people's support was also received and this series started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
I knew that brother Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in it.
Though there is no voice in colors and lines, the message of the indradhanush that is made of it proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us that the culture of making West to Wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making the waste a waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting drop on MyGov.
This cost was from brother Mohammed Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He writes Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that I have played an active role in organizing Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I think such programs should be organized every three months.
Besides, there should be online monitoring of the programme.
I think that was the first such event in which the people had directly interacted with the government.
My keenness to know about the Back to Village programme after reading the message sent to me by brother Mohammad Aslam ji and when I came to know about this in detail, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development and how encouraging they are.
The programme lasted for weeks and in almost four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, Government officials informed the people of the village about the details of government schemes and programmes.
How can the Panchayats be strengthened
How to increase their income
What can their services affect the lives of the common man
Friends, It was not just impossible for the officers to return back to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
To make the programme interesting, many other things were also included.
Sports Competitions were organized for children under Khelo India.
The Sports Kit, MNREGA's Job Card and SC-ST certificates were also shared.
The people of Kashmir became partners in this festival of development.
It is a matter of great joy that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one and a half days while walking through the remote roads.
These officers also reached the boundary commissions, which are always in the boundary boundaries of the pillars, not only in Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag, but also in the extremely sensitive areas of the district.
Some officers were so impressed by their welcome that they were staying in the village for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in this shows that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance and this also proves that the strength of development is always heavy on the strength of the bomb bomb.
It is evident that those who want to spread hatred on the path of development can never succeed in their negative intentions.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awards have been presented by Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra in his poem the month of Shravan.
In this poem, he said... meaning rainwater and water stream binding is unparalleled and the earth is enchanted by its beauty.
The people of different cultures and languages throughout India celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that this time the maximum number of devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
This time more than 28 days have joined the pilgrims in the journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015.
I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey become commendable to the spirit of joy and selfishness of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that since this year in Uttarakhand, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
For the first time, such record number of pilgrims have reached there after the heavy disaster in 2013.
I urge you people to go to those parts of the country whose beauty glows a lot during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps no one else can be a greater teacher than that.
My best wishes to you all to transmit new energy, new hopes and new expectations in all of you this beautiful and live month of serpentry.
Similarly, the month of August recalls Bharat Leave.
However, when we see on TV, we see only one side of the rain - floods, water filled with traffic jams on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am also concerned as much as you are concerned about the test of your children.
But if we change our way to see the test, then perhaps we can be uncomfortable.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I am happy that you must send your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers who have been very successful, parents and some thinkers of the society have written a lot of things to me.
I will also talk about what I have heard and what I have been told.
How much will I feel like.
I would like to listen to the message that he has sent to the youngsters of India who are proud of...
You must work, but decide a really achieved goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was a cricket game, I had a lot of expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought I would hope and fulfill my goals.
But if it is fulfilling my goals and fulfilling it then I am doing something good for the country.
And I used to always try to achieve this goal.
My focus was on the words and the goals were gradually achieved.
I will tell you that your ideas are very important to be positive.
Why competition
Why not compliance
Why should we take our time to compete with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why don't we decide to break all our old records
You jaws, nobody can stop you from moving forward.
And whenever you break your old records, you will feel satisfactory for enjoyment and satisfaction.
Friends, Do not consider the examination as a game of data.
Don't get stuck in the number of accounts that came to Katal.
Life should be linked to a great purpose.
We have to walk with our dreams, we have to be committed.
Whether these tests are being corrected or not, our speed is correct or not.
And that's why if the dreams are large, weird then the test will become a joyful festival.
Each test will be a step to fulfil this great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving this great goal.
And do not be limited to what will happen this year and what will happen in such a test.
If you take a very big goal and somebody remains less than expected then there will be no depression.
And the courage to make efforts with greater strength.
Thousands of people have written to me small things from mobile phones on my app.
Shree Gupta has stressed that healthy mind remains in a healthy body.
Students, take care of your studies as well as your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now, on the last day, I don't want you to start drilling and go to run three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of examination, how is your daily routine
Our 365 days should be our daily routine in line with our dreams and commitments.
I agree with Mr. Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specially urged him to sleep on time and to revive the whale in the morning.
The examination centre must reach the entrance and other things before time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has done this thing. Maybe I don't want to say because I am a little sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends also complain to me that you sleep very less.
And this is possible.
You're not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is some problem in our body part alone .
Not only this, our daily routine is also distracted.
And that's why we do not consider any cheese as small.
You don't have yourself in the habit of dealing with the lice that you are sure.
Definitely, look.
Friends, sometimes I have seen that the students who go for examination have two types of students.
You must have seen these two types of students.
If anybody can do this better than me, then in making a check-up whose mastery is and the world's largest players who have made a check-up.
The Champion Viswanathan, Champion of Tewa Chess, will tell his experience.
Come, let us learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, I am the first to start my speech by conveying my best wishes to you, Vishwanathan Anand.
I will talk about the tests I have given and its experiences.
Observations look like problems in life later.
When you play, you don't know what fee will come now, as you don't even know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy, and you have taken a sufficient sleep then you will get the right answer that will give you the mind at that moment.
So be quiet.
Don't put more pressure on yourself, don't have much expectations, it is very important.
Look at it as a challenge. I remember what I have been paid during the year, I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, you may not be able to remember properly, pass through important things.
You can remember some details with teachers or students, which will help you in writing in the examination.
If you repeat the questions you feel difficult then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write about it in a better way.
Therefore, keep quiet, take adequate sleep, don't feel confident and don't feel depressed, initially I can cross these tests successfully.
Hence, believe in yourself.
Vishwanathan Anand has actually spoken very importantly.
Sometimes we used to hear about the incident of Arjun's life, how his eyes were on the bird.
Apprehension is going on. If you are pushing the books in the last moments then your mind cannot be calm.
Have a lot of laughing, keep talking to friends, you will see that the atmosphere of peace will be maintained.
You can imagine that a pond is shivering, and a beautiful thing is visible below the pond.
But if you suddenly throw stones in some water and start swallowing in water then what will be the beautiful things that were seen in the pond
If the water is calm then it sees how deep it is.
But if the water is uncomfortable then nothing is visible below.
I would like to see that if I don't want to get a little lighter.
So I have developed my own technology.
It is my experience that you will also be able to work.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my app: If we feel at least half an hour light with friends and family members every day, my father has said this very important thing because mostly we want to count how wrong we have done.
We get stuck in it.
Friends, don't do this.
After coming out of it spend half an hour .
Rajat ji is really like understanding.
While explaining this in the present context, Ramcharit Manas, he is trying to reach this Sanskrit in the country and the world.
Such a revered Muraribapu has also sent a very important drop for students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and that is why there is a synergy in his words.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy to accept the situation.
In your exam, if you go ahead with a loadless and happy mind then you will certainly succeed and even if you do not get success, there will be no disappearance and the pride of being successful.
I am also grateful to Pujayashri Muraribabu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, Today I want to tell you another thing.
I am seeing that this time, those who have told me their experiences have certainly discussed Yoga.
Friends, I will make it clear today that it will be unjust to you if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning.
However, it is true that Yoga is a big chant in the development journey of interaction, whether it is in student life or in the late life.
Easy keys.
Look, if you can.
I have a lot of faith in it.
It's not like that, buddy.
But if you read the suggestions then perhaps we compromise that, yes, right, let's go, I have to go.
And I would urge you to go in five minutes, but you must read the suggestions.
For the first time when I read, I felt that it doesn't come to me, but if I read that thing again then I came to my notice that no questions are asked in another way, but this is what I do not understand the questions.
Rao, he stressed the courage.
Even in very few words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Let us hear the message of Rao Saheb.
"It's from Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
I am speaking.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety due to examination.
And this is a competitive test.
Don't worry, you do good.
I call my young friends the same.
Always remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees you also have the right to be here.
You must have strength, stability and penance.
With such quality, you will be successful in every test and other efforts.
What is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What they have spoken is dedication, determination and diligence.
If you're looking at it, you'll be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now I have given a message about the experience of the right-wing test on my app.
He said that in his family, there is a constant effort to create a positive environment during the examination.
It is true that the Secretary also said that the positive approach, the positive frame of the Mind.
We are studying in our curriculum on the dose of electricity researcher Thomas Elva Edition.
But friends, how many years have they taken to do this thing, how many times they have been able to do it, how much time has gone, how much money has gone and how disappointment has been caused due to the failure.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that even in failing, the possibility of success is hidden.
Who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan
His formal education did not include countless subjects, he did not have any special training.
But he contributed deeply to various sectors such as methematic analysis, number theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter category is popular all over the world today, but it was not like that in the beginning.
He had to face many problems.
Rolling said that in difficulties, he used to work with full energy, which was indeed important for them.
Today the examination is not only of students but also of the entire thoughts, and of the entire school and the teachers.
But it is not good that the student is alone without the support of the girl and teacher.
The examination becomes easier if there is a teacher or a girl or a senior student by making a team and making a unit with a similar idea.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnavve has written to me on the app. He has complained that parents should not have any pressure to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged to prepare only.
If the child is talking to his friend then do not stop him.
Make a light atmosphere, create a positive environment, your daughters or daughters, see how many confederations come.
You will also be able to see these compounds.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends, the lives of our people have changed greatly than our old generations.
Every moment, new discovery, new technologies and scientific solutions are visible.
And we are not just feeling that.
We like to join it, we also want to move beyond the scientific scientific level.
I am doing this because today is a National Science Day.
The country's Science Festival is celebrated on 28 February as National Science Day.
On February 28, 128 S. C.
Raman announced his discovery of the Raman effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
The curiosity belongs to the people of science.
And new research cannot be done without science and technology.
On this National Science Day, emphasis is on innovation in the country.
Knowledge, technology, all these things should be a comfortable part of our development journey.
And this time theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Driven Innovations.
Friends, Whenever success is achieved after a long time, the vision of the world changes.
If you have been very busy in the examination, you might have been able to know that many news is not recorded in your mind.
But I want to repeat this thing to the countrymen.
You must have heard that there has been a very big and important research in the world of science.
The scientists of the world have worked hard, generations have come, have done something and a success has been achieved after about a hundred years.
The research of Gravitational Waves has emerged as a man of our scientists.
This research is a very far-reaching success of science.
This exploration does not only authenticate the theory of our great scientists in the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity will be used all over the world.
But as an Indian, we are happy that the sons of our country were associated with the procedure of exploration.
Our scientists will continue to move forward in the future.
India will also be a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken in the last days.
In order to achieve greater success in this discovery, the government has decided to open it in India in the Laser International-Wave Observation Tunnel.
This process will be a new energy and a new pace by adding India.
India will surely become an active partner in this extensive scientific research process of humanity between its limited resources.
Once again, I extend my best wishes to all the scientists.
Yesterday, you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by encouraging me on that number.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
The number of measurements is 8108-8108.
81908- 81908, your examination is going on.
Hey, you know, there's a budget tomorrow.
On the occasion, we all celebrated Christmas and now preparations for the new year's welcome are going on.
India is full of diversity.
In a way, every festival is waiting for the second festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the festival is running.
This becomes the reason for the economic activity of the poor sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for Christmas (Nattal) and many good wishes for the New Year 2016.
The year 2016 brings immense happiness to all of you.
New enthusiasm, new enthusiasm and new resolve will bring you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Savleshwarkar has written to me that this season is the season of tourists.
There is a large number of tourists from abroad.
People also go to celebrate the holidays of Natal.
The cleaner our tourist destinations will become the best of India in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am bringing the message of Ganesh ji to the people of the country.
However, we call the guest Dev Bhav, whenever we have to visit a guest.
And at our tourist destinations, at the destinations of the tourists, at our pilgrimage destinations, this is actually a special focus.
He is an ordinary worker and works hard, works.
He has done such a wonderful thing that his words are finally printed.
And in my mind, I also felt that I had brought this to you.
In Bhojpura village, he has made 100 toilets so far as he believes that this work is a sacred task without labour.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes I hear about depression in the country.
And this is the thing that takes the country forward and it is natural for them to take pride in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the immense efforts of many people that the country is moving forward at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving one step ahead and the country is also moving ahead.
New opportunities for better education, better skills and employment.
It is a big task to provide easy loans to the people of the ordinary family who cannot reach the windows of the bank.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna when Balakrishna opened his mouth and visited Mother Yashoda to the whole of Brahman.
The event of Yoga has made India aware of it.
The talk of cleanliness is echoing at home in a way.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
The villages in which electricity can be reached after so many years of independence, the extent of the zeal and zeal that the village gets away from the darkness cannot be estimated by the people living in the cities who use electricity.
It has not been discussed in the media so far, but I am confident that the media will certainly reach such villages and the biggest benefit will be that the workers of the government who are doing this work will be so satisfied that they have done so much that they have done so that they are going to change the lives of any village.
Whether the farmers, the poor, the young, the women, should all these services reach or not
That is why it should not be reached that what government has worked and no government has worked.
But that is why they should not let them go if they are entitled to this matter.
Should they also get information for getting their rights
We all should try to reach the right thing, good thing, the work of the people of the country, as much as possible.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing in my way.
I can't do anything alone.
But I should do something of what I am doing .
A common citizen can also join me by downloading the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone.
And I have been sharing the words of such a small one.
And it is a matter of joy for me that people also tell me a lot.
How can I reach without your help
Come, let us all talk of the interests of the common man, to the language of the common man and to inspire them to get the goods of their own.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on 16th January, the Government of India is going to launch the entire Action Plan of Startup India and Standup India.
And in this programme, IIT, IIM, Central Universities, NITIs and youth from all over the country will be connected through Live-Connectivity.
Whether it is a digital world or an IT business, this startup is for them.
Yes, we have to change it according to the requirement of India.
We'll get the market.
In the same way is the intellect of our youth slightly limited to some cities
This idea is wrong.
Youngsters have talent in the corner of India and I must get the opportunity.
This Startup India, Standup India should not be adequately limited to some cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take this forward.
On January 16, I will surely meet you and talk in detail about this and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Young friends, on January 12, Swami Vivekananda ji's birth anniversary.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekananda ji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year, it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January.
And I have come to know that this time their theme is because their event is based on the theme, that theme is very good, I have been told that more than 10,000 youth from all the states and corner of India are going to be gathered.
Young India has to be decorated.
In a way, the dreams are to be fulfilled.
The commitment is to be felt.
Can you inform me about this youth festival
I especially urge the young friends that my Narendra Modi App is.
So I will wait for you to know your ideas about the Youth Festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, a Visually Challenged Teacher of Ahmedabad, celebrated the Excellent India Day in his school.
He has expressed his feelings by telephoning me, sir, and accomplished India in my school.
We enjoyed the school and inspired children to help the disabled in society.
I think it was the first to be done by you.
Thank you very much.
And you are working in this field yourself.
If you understand these things in a very good way and give it then many problems will be solved.
Sometimes there is a chance to meet such a person in the society and we have some ideas.
We also express our vision of going to them according to our thinking.
And many words have been used in the world for such people, but there has always been contemplation towards words.
Every time people feel that they don't like identifying this word, they don't feel proud.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I had to go to that programme.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in some districts of Tamil Nadu, that is why on that day I could not be present in the programme.
But he had to go to the programme, he used to keep some thoughts in my mind.
At that time, I had thought that those who have given some deficiency in the body, who have suffered some damage, who have worked properly, who are also called disabled and are known as disabled.
But sometimes when they come in their introduction then it is known that we see a deficiency of their eyes but God has given them some special benefit.
After that it was thought in my mind that with eyes we feel that it is disabled but it feels that some extra power can be distinguished from it .
And when I went then I was wondering why do not we use the word Divyang instead of disabled in our country
These are people who have such organs that one or the other are such organs in which there is a communication of divineness and disabilities, which are not with us, ordinary people.
I like this word.
Can our countrymen spread the habit of word Divyang instead of handicappedness
I am confident that you will take this forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
It will make it easier for the people with disabilities by improving the interface in both physical and indirect ways.
Whether it is a school or a bus station or a railway station, there are remps, easy parking, accessible lifts, braille scripts and all these things.
They need innovation, technology, system and sensitivity to make their availability easier.
We have taken the lead in this work.
Peoples participation is also getting.
They should not be dead in files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to reach the entitlements of the schemes easily.
In our country, subsidies are provided in gas cylinders.
The government has made some changes in this.
Whether it is Jan Dhan accounts or Aadhaar Cards, it is the largest, the world's largest, logistics Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme to reach the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
The scheme is known as the first and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, nearly 15 crore cooking gases have become beneficiaries of the first scheme.
In the accounts of 14 crore people, government funds have begun to go straight to the bank account.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhaar card, on the other hand the opening of Jan Dhan accounts, on the third hand the state government and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have started directly entering the beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
There is a sixth estimate on me that about 35 to 40 projects are being directly incorporated under the benefit transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a golden moment of the Republic of India is also a pleasant coincidence that this time we are the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
There was also a special discussion on the two-day Constitution in the Parliament and it was very good.
All the parties discussed the importance of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the realization of the Constitution, etc.
We should take this forward.
Can the people be connected to the system in the true sense of the Republic Day
Our Constitution gives us a lot of authority and the official should be discussed in a spiritual manner.
However, the Constitution also emphasizes the duty and duty.
But it has been observed that the discussion of taxation is very low.
Whenever elections are held, there are public reports all around, it is written on the walls, hoardings are placed that voting is our sacred duty.
At the time of voting, there is a lot of fault, but why does not there be talk of fault even in social life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, can we celebrate on 26th January in schools, colleges, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations, poetic competitions, duties etc.
If one and a half crore countrymen go through the duties then how big history can be created.
Can you send me that
I want to know your ideas.
He sent me to my portal My Goa.
I would like to know what the youngsters of my country think about the duties
I want to make a small suggestion.
On 26th January, when we celebrate the Republic Day, we have the statues of great men in our city by citizens, children from school colleges.
And I am not waiting for the government.
As a society, as a country, can we make it our natural nature
On 26th January, we all try to commemorate the idols of such great men, the sanitation of the premises, the cleanliness of the premises, and all these are easily done by the citizens through Jan Ardhan.
Ladies and gentlemen, once again my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
There must have been a chance to go.
And businesses have also started with new festivals.
On the other hand, the preparations for Christmas would have started.
Festival has a significance in society.
The news of natural calamities is always received from every corner of the world and there is news of natural calamities that they have not heard or have not thought.
People are also feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences to all those families in the moment of this crisis.
The State Governments are working with the unable to get relief.
The central government also works with a handloom.
A section of the Government of India has recently gone to Tamil Nadu.
But when we want to talk about confusion, we have to bring about a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector because there was more and more natural calamities, i. e.
Today the form of this has changed.
At every level, we have become very important to work for building our capabilities.
The governments, civil society, citizens and every small organisation have to work in a very scientific manner to build capacity.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shri Nawaz Sharif.
And I suggested that we should jointly make a joint exercise for the pre-determination of the disaster.
I am glad that a tablet of exercises and best practices of SAARC countries were concluded in Delhi.
A good start.
Today, I got the phone of Lakhvinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
(Yes, I am speaking from Jalandhar in Punjab district.
We make organic farming here and guide many people.
I am very happy to hear your messages.
Not only this, you are aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concern is true, but this happens only in Punjab Haryana.
This is our habit throughout India and in a traditional way we are on the path of burning the remains of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
First of all, we have to train our farmers brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of crops are also very precious.
It itself is a biological fertilizer.
We are weeding it.
Not only this, if its small pieces are made then it becomes a dry fruit for animals.
Secondly, the upper layer of the earth is burnt due to burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, think that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidneys are good, everything is good, but if the upper skin of the body burns then what will happen
Even if the heart continues, you cannot live.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which pushes our subsequent land to death.
And therefore, its positive efforts should be made.
It becomes sure once again that this fist is littered in the ground.
Or if a slight water is poured out in a basket, then it becomes a better biological fertilizer.
Not only this, if we put the fertilizer manufactured in the land then it will be beneficial.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers of banana farming.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier, whenever he used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crops were over, he had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10,000 and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And as long as those who took it, they used to be lying down.
But some farmers proved that six-six-six-eight inches of this piece of piece of piece of pieces and beat them on the ground.
The water that is in the stove keeps the water alive.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with DCability.
Last time I had discussed organ donations in Mann Ki Baat.
I also discussed the helpline of boats for organ donation.
Indian Organ Donation Day was celebrated on November 2.
Several well-known filmmakers including Ravina Tandon joined the film.
Organ donation can save precious lives.
When organs go from one body to another then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life .
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness in this sector and in the true sense, the needy will get the best help, because no one can donate this help until they get it from anyone else.
I had earlier said that on December 3, it is celebrated as a disabled day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes there is pain when they are funny.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and compassion is shown.
But if we change our vision and change their vision then these people can inspire us to live.
Something can inspire you to get rid of.
Even if we have a small problem, we start crying.
When I remember that my problem is very small, how does it deal with
And that is why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
Their lifestyle is commendable to enhance their vision and integrity with their lives.
Javed Ahmad, I want to talk to him today.
40-42 years old.
In 16th century, the traitors shot Javed Ahmad in Kashmir.
The ability to emerge on his feet has always gone, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
They cannot even bear the wounds of treason.
The body does not support, but for twenty years they have been drowned in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies into this direction.
He gained Master Degree in social work and became a messenger of handicapped people as a social worker, he is making a silent revolution today.
Are we not sufficient to inspire the life of Javed in every corner of India
I especially remember Javed Ahmad's life and his dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, the lamps of such inspiration are shining in every corner of India.
The new light of life is spreading, showing ways.
On December 3, there is an opportunity to get inspiration from them by remembering all of them.
Be it the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the vulnerable, the afflicted, the exploited, the deprived, the government has to maintain regular arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad feeling from some government Babu in life.
And it changes our vision of looking at the government system for the entire life.
Often we don't even know because we are so comfortable that we don't know that any government system or any government servant is doing this.
ASHA workers in our country are the networks across the country.
We have never heard of discussions about ASHA workers among the people of India.
But whenever I am the world-renowned family of Bill Gates Foundation, their success in the world has become a phenomenon.
We had jointly distributed Padma to both such Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
He works very socially in India.
The time of his retirement and whatever he earns for the entire life is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of Odisha has specially honoured a ASHA worker on Independence Day.
They should be treated on the basis of the preliminary arrangements they have been taught.
Emphasis on the use of every household insecticides.
As our child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be taken, ASHA worker Jamuna Mani Singh is working with full dedication to protect the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he faced malaria and prepared to face the entire village.
How much money will be there.
How many lakhs of people will be around us.
We will look at them with pride.
How many such people become incapable of our country.
How big accomplishments of the society become.
I extend pride to all such hope workers through Jamunamani.
An e-book on the inspirational events of Swachh Bharat, about the ideal village of Parliament and health sector.
I urge you to see it.
Not only this, show others.
Read it and it may be that you are keen to add such things.
So you must be Mygov.
Please send him in.
Such things do not come in our minds very quickly, but they can only be true for the society.
The positive energy is the largest.
You should also tell good things - share.
So you can actually become a social teacher.
The temperature of the earth should not increase anymore.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, anxiety.
And it is the first way to save temperature.
Energy savings are 14 December National Energy Protection Day.
Several schemes are underway from the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
I once said that on the night of full moon, the lights of sugarcane should be bathed in the full moonlight by blinding the lights of sugarcane.
They should feel the light of the moon.
If a friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it, I would like to tell you this thing.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have got the opportunity to read more.
But they are doing such a thing that perhaps nobody has thought.
He is working to provide affordable to the poor by using solar energy.
He has formed a committee of women and has set up a platform for solar energy-driven Fans.
And they pay the fees at a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
People take phans in the evening and come back in the morning and give them for charging.
I have heard that people of 500 houses come in large numbers.
Now see what the world's largest people will do for climate change, but a light is doing such a thing that is inspiring everyone.
And, like this, Noorjahan means to publish the world.
He is spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjah and congratulate i TV because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
Congratulations.
I have received a phone from Shri Abhishekkumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We want to know from the old Prime Minister that how is the support given to adventurous persons like us in the mudra bank that runs
Mudra encourages business entrepreneurs.
Mudra creates opportunities for earnings.
And Mudra empowers in the real sense.
This Mudra scheme is underway to help small adventurous people.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning is good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in this 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are SCs, STs and OBCs who try to run a family with respect to their own hard work.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone has said to me that there is a slaughter in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he received loans of Rs. 8.
And he started a business of Sujay Dress Safai.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I said that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
He has brought a tank and I am told that in such a short span of time, he also paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
Finally, this is the mission under our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier he used to pay a lot of interest.
And earlier, due to the reasons for more interests and other reasons, the money that was spent was now being saved by them, about one thousand rupees per month.
And a good business of his family began to grow gradually.
But I would like to have more publicity of the scheme.
All our banks become more sensitive and help more and more small people.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
It is only those who work in small scale that are economically impossible for the country.
We also seek to focus on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had discussed one India, the best India.
There are things that should be constant awareness in society's life.
What is the structure of the program
What is Logo
How does public participation increase
I had said for all these suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I expect a lot of chocolate schemes.
And I am told that the participants have to get certificates.
Any big rewards have been announced.
You also run your creative mind.
How can this mantra of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat make this mantra to connect one Indian
Whether it is lifelong or glorious or lively or ease of connecting everyone, what should the government do
What do the society do
What does civil society do
There may be many things.
I am sure your suggestions will be useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would urge you to use this good season for some time to keep the body healthy.
And make an environment in the family, it is a festival of the family, one hour is all to do this together.
You see how consciousness comes and how much the body gives the whole day.
If there is a good weather then it will also be a good habit.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes again.
Jaihind...
My dear countrymen, my greetings to your brothers.
Once again, I am fortunate to join you with the words of mind.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to be held in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased significantly.
I extend my best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
I would like that if such academic centres across the country look at such aware and active people in the area of their own country, then the objective of our peoples participation will get a new strength.
And that's why I congratulate all the colleagues of the Kannur Akashwani Centre.
Students from St. Mary Upper Primary School, Chittor in Kerala have written a letter to me.
The letters are special in many ways.
First, these children have prepared a picture of Mother India with their fingerprints.
I have sent a picture of the map of India.
Earlier, I was very surprised to see why he made the map of India with his fingerprints.
But when I read his letter, I understand that he has given some good responsibilities.
These are the children who have tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is running a campaign of public awareness for organ donation.
He has also laid the foundation of jy plays in many places so that people can understand organ donations.
Organ donation is a trend and activity.
These kids have written to me in the letter that you should appeal to people about organ donation in your mind.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have a lot of messages on the phone call.
Devesh ji of Delhi has given me a similar message.
Every 10 lakh person is a very fruitful step taken by the government to donate organs by one.
I feel that this is very important.
More than 2. 5 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donors are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 1. 25 billion we can only succeed in five thousand transplants.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
And we can reach only twenty five thousand.
We can only give one to the needs of four eyes.
Efforts have also been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the leaflet and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of organ donation in the field of organ donation.
Many social institutions and many voluntary organizations are working very well in this direction.
The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization-NOTO has been set up to encourage organ transplantation.
A helpline worked for 24 hours is also available at 1800 1140 services.
And we have been told that Tyakteen Bhunjitha.
The excellent description of the joy of sacrifice is in the Mantra of Tyakteen Bhunjitha.
A few days ago, we all saw on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Organ donor, let us reflect the feelings of Talteen Bhunjitha and let us inspire this thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, recently we celebrated Navratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
And a few days later, I will also celebrate Diwali.
Eid is also celebrated by Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Foren Summit will be organised in New Delhi from 26th to 2nd October.
For the first time, such a large scale event is being organised on the earth of India.
Champions have been invited to the leaders of African countries and unions.
A pack of African countries' largest summit is being organised outside Africa.
The relationship between India and Africa is deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And if we get both, we are the third of the world's population.
And it says that lakhs of years ago this was the same hungry.
Later these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
Our good reflects in natural resources.
And about 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
However, India plays a very important role in training the youth of most African countries.
More than 25 thousand African students are studying in India for human resources development, capacity building.
And today there are leaders from many African countries who have read in India.
So how deep do we have
And from that point of view, this Summit is very important.
Normally, when the summit is received, the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, the Chiefs are scheduled to meet at this Summit.
But our efforts are to ensure that the people should also be mixed with it.
Nearly sixteen schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren have written to give a boost to India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition called 'Memories of Mahatma' from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is reaching Delhi from Porbandar to the Northern States on 2nd October.
Millions of children from the school have seen this exhibition.
The people of the village looked at how Mahatma Gandhi had played a major role in Africa and India's relations and how was the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality on the ground.
The vision of the school children of our smaller places is so brilliant that they can see how deeply they think.
However, this summit is of India-Africa, but we can clearly see how it becomes an opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Garima, all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time, on 15th August, I had made a proposal for the Parliamentarian Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, many MPs have fulfilled this work.
I am very happy to be here.
A workshop was organized in Bhopal last month.
Wherever this ideal village is being built, the Sarpanchs there, the collectors there, some MPs there, the Government of India, the state government and all of them together discussed the Adarshgram scheme.
Several new things have come into mind and many encouraging things have been found.
I would like to take some of these things in your mind.
Jharkhand, in a way, is a very large area and tribal area.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
It was difficult for government employees to go there too.
I congratulate Honble Parliamentarian, Mr. Karia Mundaji.
And in a way, the school provides education to children in the morning and to make children teachers in the evening.
And about five hundred and fifty illiterates were sown by these children, they were reading and reading.
We can see how big changes can be brought from desired skills through Poodi Gram Panchayats.
This village is well known for manufacturing sugarcane and Kurtai jaggery in the state.
Shriman Ruwala ji inaugurated the Kurtayi jaggery festival on 11th March in this village.
People of old public life also came.
An exhibition was also organised to enhance the sale of sugarcane.
How can the village be made the centre of economic activities, how can the manufacturing of the village be sold
Shriman Ruwala ji is actually a congratulatory officer for his efforts to make an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be a matter of mind and hygiene
Savita Roy of Mumbai has sent me a message through telephone: "We clean our houses every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This Deepavali should make our homes clean as well as the outer environment and maintain its cleanliness even after Deepavali.
He has taken care of the truth.
I would like to recall you, my dear countrymen, last year after the festivals of Deepavali, especially the media launched a massive joy and showed that wherever the pitcher was waste after Deepavali, it was not right.
All the media persons had launched a campaign for awareness.
And the result was that after Diwali, a clean drive was launched.
So, it is true that Savita ji should be done even after the festival as we worry about before the festival.
It should be done in every public event.
And today, especially I would like to congratulate the entire media world of India.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and on the occasion of one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I am fortunate to participate in the cleanliness summit organized by India Today.
He gave Clean India Awards and I was also looking at how many activities are going on.
For this, people themselves are working as a One Light One Mission.
How are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
All these things came to light and at that time I thanked the commendable work of India to Day Group.
He has been encouraging cleanliness work for the last one year through e-TV.
He added 51 lakh children of about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, gardens, many of them have launched a massive campaign for cleanliness.
Now these news shows the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat on its own.
The mission of Clean India is hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers, because of lack of time I cannot name everyone but everyone has launched this campaign.
And that is why according to the suggestions given by Savita Raiji, the entire country is accepting this work and pushing it forward.
From Meghalaya, I have written a letter to our Governor, Honble Shanmuganath.
And through this letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He wrote that for the last few years, this village has taken the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award of the cleanest village in Asia.
I am happy to hear that there is also a village in Meghalaya in the far-flung North East in our country that has been engaged in the sanitation sector for years.
It has become a habit of the citizens there, the culture of the village has become.
This is what gives us confidence that our country will surely become clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to take out our chest and say with pride that the joys have freed our mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that there are some things where corruption has been done.
When the poor person goes for small jobs, he does not know how many problems he has to face.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who is fully testing a person in two minutes interview.
And I had announced this idea that why don't we abolish the tradition of interview for small jobs
My dear young friends, today I am proud to say that the government has completed all the procedures and the central government's Group D Group C and Group B Non Gazetted posts will no longer be taken into account.
The Rule will come into force from 1st January, 2016.
We will not hinder the procedure that is going on now, but it will come into force from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to the young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered to be a medium of economic security.
The keys of the time are considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in society.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the locker and we had to pay the locker.
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will pay you in the form of interest.
Speak , cannot the countrymen become wealth now
Whether gold can be converted from dead money into a living strength or not .
Just this is what we have to do.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
Its safety and interest, two benefits.
Take sure advantage.
There is another scheme, the golden gold bond does not come in your hands, but there is a paper.
However, the same amount of gold is about one gold and the same amount of money will be repaid to you on the day you will repay this paper.
So we are launching these schemes.
We don't need to buy gold now.
So I will surely present this scheme of security guarantee before the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am glad to say that we are bringing gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Nearly 70 years since our independence, but so far we have been using foreign gold coins, or have also been using the gold bulbs and neighbours.
Why should not our country be indigenous marks
Therefore, in the coming weeks and before density, we will come out and wealth will be available to the common people. Indian gold coins of five grams and eight grams of Ashoka cycle are being started.
Besides, the Gold Bullion of 20 grams will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring new changes in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The map of Akhand Bharat comes in memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the best India.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
He has introduced his capabilities as a iron man.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but he had a dream of uniting India, which he had shown in a geographical manner, but this mantra of unity should always be the medium of our thoughts, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Several sects, many sects, many languages, many castes, many dresses, many diversity, our country, and this diversity is because of which our splendor is there.
If this was not a diversity then perhaps we might have been proud of the beauty that we cannot take.
And that is why, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, 31st October has been organised by the entire country's run for unity.
I have heard that this time too it is being organised all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for the run of unity.
The race of unity is a race for development in true sense.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a run of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Progress the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, on the next day of Deepawali, I am going to visit Britain.
I am very excited about my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the state governments also provide scholarships to such sections of society, whether it is a vulnerable, tribal or backward, those who go abroad.
I am confident that this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage destination for those children of India who will be able to live in Britain.
And that is why I am telling you that I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
And now that building is a property of millions of countrymen, with which Babasaheb Ambedkar's name is being added, you can imagine how much joy will be for people like me.
I am going to get another opportunity in London and the unveiling of the statue of Lord Bashweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Bashweshwar for democracy and women empowerment is actually a studyer of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Basweshwar on the house of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India used to think about these centuries ago.
You know that when such incidents have been added, we all get thrilled in the minds of the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, your letters are also discussed on the astronomy.
Discussions are made by inviting government officials.
Some people write their problems and also try to solve the problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
A good kinship has been tied up between us.
Last time I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jaihind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, greetings to your brothers.
I have had a fundamental idea in my life and that is why I have a immense faith in the power of the people, but the word Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood and what I have experienced, I can say that even more manpower is inconvenient than we think.
Our ancestors used to say that Jan Janardhana is a part of God.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great strength in the thinking of our ancestors, because I have realized that I was asking for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and every time I could talk about two or four suggestions but millions of people used to be active and suggesting me, this is a great strength.
Yes, these lakhs of letters have also given me a lot of understanding.
The different departments of the government have analyzed the letters of the people and what is the matter of policy.
Who had thought that the source of these information would be Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that Selfie with Dr. and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps somebody in all the countries of the world has got the dignity of selfie with doctors and daughters in lakhs.
And when he used to do Selfie With Doctor, he used to enhance the enthusiasm of his daughter but he was also committed to himself.
When people used to see, it was felt that the neglect of daughters would have to be neglected.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I told the same citizens that if you go to Incredible India or if there is a good investigation then I will see it.
However, in the number of lakhs of people from all corners of India, the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government had never thought that we have such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is it not the demand of time that ' Khadi for fashion '
Today, I am very happy that the sale of fertilizer has almost doubled in the last one year. Now this work has not happened due to some government reports.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher was standing in a widowed woman line to leave subsidy.
The general public of the society, the middle class, the lower middle class, for which it is difficult to leave subsidy, but such people have left.
Is not this silent revolution
Is it not the philosophy of this manpower
The governments also have to learn that the work that happens in our government offices is a powerful, powerful and competitive society of a larger manpower beyond Umbra.
He made every small thing his own and tried to connect himself for the betterment of the country.
What can be greater satisfaction than this
In Mann Ki Baat, this time I thought of taking a new experiment.
I had prayed to the citizens of the country to telephone and recognise your questions and suggestions.
I will focus on Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
The people of all ages have given messages.
I liked to hear some messages myself.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have taken one minute or two minutes but your phone call for me is very important.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was amazing and happy for me.
It feels like negative and negative around.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had to speak of their own words.
But I am surprised that all things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, indicative, creative.
People have said that more than 0 per cent of the rest of the energy is enjoying.
They must have heard the radio.
I remember how important the radio would be for the visually impaired people.
I am watching a new idea and telling such a good thing. These people are also sufficient to make the government sensitive.
I have given a message to Pawan Acharya from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen to what they want to say - "Maru is a Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like the wind, your feelings will surely reach every corner of India.
It is a good suggestion that soil is not only roots but also soil lamps are incomplete.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the Army.
Whether it is our navy, the land or the air force, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy.
The war that took place in 1965 had completed 50 years with Pakistan.
It has constructed a honourable exhibition near the India Gate in Delhi.
From the point of view of history, you will be able to learn a lot and if you look for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no greater inspiration than to serve the motherland.
Whether the fight is from Hajipeer or from the real north or from Chaminda or from Hajipeer, it is thrilling to see the scenes of the victory and our army is proud of the soldiers.
I also had to meet these brave families and those who participated in the war are also in the north era of life.
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history in depth.
I have come back in two and a half hours but it will take you three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has instructed the elder Prime Minister, but he has forgotten to call his name in the wake of the upliftment.
We should also make a habit of cleanliness and also make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction with the message of this child.
I have to hear a lot too.
I see the best thing that the Parliament of the country is also discussing about the cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament and on the one hand, both the children of this country talk about cleanliness. What can be the fortune of a big country
The movement that is going on, the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt is being created - awareness about cleanliness - it will also ensure that the governments are able to work.
Even if there is a shortage of deficiencies, we have to move forward and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you will know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Once he said, If I have to choose one of the two freedom and hygiene, then I will first choose hygiene, and after independence, the importance of hygiene was even more than independence.
Gulshan Arora ji from Delhi has delivered a message on MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the lives of great men are always a cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our task to assess the ideas that the great man was of.
You take out any date, some of the windows of history will get the name of a great man.
In the coming days, let us remember all these great men, let us reach homes and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I specially urge you to once again for 2nd October.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I had said last year that you will have every kind of fashion clothes, every kind of fabric, many things, but it should also have a place for a mule.
I once again say that from 2nd October to 1 month Khadi is free.
It should take advantage of it.
And with Khadi, handlooms should be given the same importance.
The poor man who makes a Khadi will go to the house of a widow and that is why in this Deepavali, we must replace Khadi in our house and place our body.
And when we saw that the sale was almost doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
You people have done the work that the government cannot do with the help of non-performance.
This is the manpower and that is why I once again urge you to do this thing.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy with one thing.
You must also get some taste of this pleasure.
I had gone to Kolkata in May and I had come to meet the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose had organised everything.
I had the opportunity to spend the evening with the family members of Subhash Babu for a long time.
You can imagine how happy will be for me
The family members of Netaji may have come here for the first time to visit the Prime Minister's residence in his life.
However, it is a matter of great pleasure for me that there has never been a good fortune for such hospitality at the Vada Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana which I am going to get in October.
The people of more than 50 families of Subhash Babu live in different countries and all the people are coming specially.
I got a message from the ears of Bharagvi and listening to him, I felt that he himself was a leader and perhaps he would become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the elder Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about water registration so that in the coming days, the participation of the younger generation increases and in choosing and running the important cooperation of the younger generation in the future.
Every voter in the democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing gradually.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission is acting as the only controller, but in the last few years there has been a big change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just a regulator but has become a comfortable voter friend and all its ideals are in the polling station.
The voter list should continue to be upgraded and we should also keep on examining.
I would like to say during the election that after polling, water was washed away.
How sacred it is, everyone should do it.
I visited Kashi on the very day.
I got a seventh grade student named Kshitij Pandey.
He is a seventh grade at the Central School of Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is very intense intellect.
But I have seen their interest in research in physics at such a young age.
He was talking about how the sensitivities came in the robots, he was very proud.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child .
How
When
This child should ask the mind.
In the same way, I had to meet a very small boy from Sonam Patel.
New year old.
She is the daughter of a very poor family of Sadabriz Patel, a resident of Sundarpur in Varanasi and I am surprised that the whole song of the child is confounded to her.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him, he used to speak, used to define it in English, used to define it in Hindi.
Only songs read or sound others .
If you take history, it's all faced in the evening.
We all are surprised to know how he is so talented in the entire family
I was really very impressed.
Some children have the hobby of celebrity but Sonam had nothing to do with this.
Besides reading in the newspapers that you see on TV, we do a lot of work and sometimes such things are also enjoyed.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people bring a lot of work for me in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do with me
I have to do so much money once a month, I have to do so much time.
Sometimes my friends of our skywater have to wait for half-four hours.
But I respect your feelings.
I am grateful to you for your suggestion.
Now it is just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used to use radio
He started his radio from Germany and he was constantly aware of the movement of freedom to the citizens of India through radio.
He inaugurated the Azad Hind Radio from a weekly News Bulletin.
He used to run these radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu in all languages.
It's a year since I was talking about Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani.
I am also talking about you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again in the next month for Mann Ki Baat.
You'll be sending instruction.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Amendments begin.
Your contribution is very valuable for me.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Once again, I have got the opportunity to come here to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People in remote areas are celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
In view of social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes in a wide range.
I had made a small statement that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we will give this security scheme to our sisters.
I have received the first information that since the beginning of this scheme, 11 crore households have been associated with this scheme.
Moreover, I was also told that about half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider this auspicious sign.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
The work that has not happened for sixty years will happen in such a short time .
I have also seen the richness of the poor
Accounts were to be opened from semen balances.
But the poor saved the amount of Rs. 20,000 crore.
Youngsters have got employment.
You will be happy to know that in a year, one lakh gatherings of financial relief camps have been set up to connect the banking sector, economy and poor people.
It is not just to stop opening the accounts.
And now thousands of people have also become officers to get overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And it was also believed that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your job to maintain it.
All of us should be active.
I am sure you will do that.
In the last few days, the incidents of Gujarat made the whole country restless.
But in a very short time, all my respected civilian brothers and sisters of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
The situation played an active role before the deterioration and once again Gujarat moved on the path of peace.
This is the right path of peace, unity and brotherhood.
And we have to walk on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the last days, I had the opportunity to meet the widows of the Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to listen to them.
And the truth is that I got the opportunity to listen to the kind of things I felt as if some music was playing.
I was very happy.
Perhaps it has become the most important thing to realize the true form of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and liberality will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that even if we believe in any sect, sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my fortune.
In India, the Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are going to come to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru Bodhgaya, was visited.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you especially today.
Earlier, I have mentioned this in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard in the public meetings, in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the government's mind is open about the debate on the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the farmers and I have been repeated.
But today, I want to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the reform of the Land Acquisition Act has come through the states, it has come forward that ifever the poor farmers will have to make nets to provide water to the fields, to provide electricity to the villages, to build roads for the village, to build houses for the poor and to provide employment to the poor youth of the village, then we have to leave the law from the election of this implementation.
And then it was proposed to amend.
But I saw that so much fear was spread, the farmers were so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my farmer should not be confused, and fear should never be there.
And I don't want to give any such opportunity to those who fear the stories and mislead the stories.
We presented an ordinance.
The term of the Ordinance is being completed on August 3, 2019.
And I have decided to allow it to be completed.
It means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one of them was incomplete.
And that is why we brought them to the Ordinance, but due to these disputes, these cases were also snatched.
And my farmer brothers and sisters, I assure you that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not just a slogan for us.
The welfare of the village and the poor farmers.
And that is why on August 15, I had said that not only the Agriculture Department but also the Department of Agriculture and Welfare will be formed.
And when the war of 1965 comes, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
It is also natural to remember all those martyrs who have kept the Tricolor flag of India and its pride.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 165 war.
I am glad that India is working in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing better.
Now we have the opportunity to reach these researches to the common man .
How to convert the principles into instruments
How to connect the lab with the land
It has to be forwarded as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an extremely inspiring for me.
And when I said in Mann Ki Baat last time, our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities, there are many opportunities.
I get many letters from the citizens.
Skill Development has been written.
From Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, Shriman Prakash Tripathi stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Improvements in education sector have been emphasized.
I have also told my young friends one thing.
I told the Red Fort on 15 August why the interview for the lower level job was done .
And when an interview calls, every poor family, widow mother, where will you get the impression
The poor do not have to run for the purpose.
There is no exploitation, there is no taxation.
These days, guests from many countries have come to India.
For health, especially for the reduction of maternal mortality and infant mortality, fourteen countries of the world have contemplated together on the land of India.
This was the first time in any other country outside the US.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India's international appreciation has also started, yet this figure is not small.
Just as we got rid of the polio, and the death of mothers and infants also got rid of it.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays the news of Dengu continues to come.
It is true that Dengu is dangerous, but its safety is very easy.
And I am directly connected to the Swachh Bharat which I am talking about.
We see advertising on TV.
There is a widespread public education in this regard, but we do not pay attention.
I would urge you all to make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Bewareness about water, sanitation - it is not right to become the cause of death.
Free check-up facilities are available at around five hundred fourteen centres across the country.
The cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, there is a festival in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali.
Why should not every festival of ours be connected to cleanliness now
You see, Sanskrit will become a habit
Jitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the feeling of serving the tribals of India is strong.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
This year, these two brothers won this race.
India's honour has increased.
I extend my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am very happy to note that he is intending to leave the entire campaign 'Team India-Vision for Tribal' for tribals.
See, how everybody is making efforts to bring the country forward.
And when we hear such incidents, the chest flourishes.
Sometimes, due to perspective, we are injustice to our youth.
My experience in youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth and we also learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say, Brother, I have taken a blessing in my life that Sande on Cycle.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day in a week.
Today, I especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now Babasaheb will become a magnificent, divine and inspirational monument of Ambedkar.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, which is going to be built by the Maharashtra government, will be an inspirational destination when Indians traveling around the world go to London.
I offer sadness to the Maharashtra government for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After a long distance, we are once again starting Mann Ki Baat, talk of people, talk of people and talk of people.
Sitting in the midst of yourself, in a light atmosphere, 130 crore people used to listen, repeat and sometimes our words were inspired for us.
You can imagine how the interim period would have gone.
Perhaps it wasn't an unbiased program.
Every moment I was missing something and when I am doing Mann Ki Baat, I would like to say that words are probably mine, sounds are mine, but the story is yours, men are yours.
I used to use my words and my words and because of this I was missing you not this programme.
I was feeling empty.
But this Sunday is a lot of waiting.
Well, it's got the opportunity.
Mann Ki Baat, in a family environment, in small, light, society, in life, which is the cause of change.
In a way, this sequence will give birth to a new feeling and in a way it will support the understanding of a New India.
I feel myself.
Sometimes I feel that this is a journey of satisfaction from myself.
This is a journey from my ego to Vayam.
For me, this quiet conversation with you was a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why I have been going to Kedarnath in the race for elections.
Most of them have taken out political meaning.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet me.
The rest of your curiosity is that I think I will also discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I am constantly feeling your efforts to strengthen a positive thing.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are totally different from the regular governmental activities.
Sometimes the task of pushing my thought process forward some of your words.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is also showing his hatred towards dirt but he also explains the efforts of cleanliness.
If any environment is discussed then it feels painful, but the experiments they have used themselves also show that they have seen and the ideas they have in their minds are also painful.
That is, in a way, I am feeling the glimpse of how the problems are solved throughout the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and society.
It shows us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate this strength and talent, provide opportunities and implement it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that all 130 crore Indians want to join the development of the country with strong and activeness and I would say that I have such a letter in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls, but there is a very little message, but there is a lot of complaint and somebody has asked for it, it has not come to me in the last five years.
When I analyze these things then you can imagine how much energy I would have received from my heart.
I have not come here but you have brought me, you have laid down me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Let us move forward with this spirit of Mann Ki Baat.
When there was a crisis in the country, it was not limited to the political sector, it was not limited to the political leaders, the movement had not been consolidated until the jail was supplied.
There was an outrage in the heart of the people.
There was a thirst for the lost democracy.
When you eat meals day and night, you don't know what hungry is, in the same way, what is the pleasure of the rights of democracy in normal life when somebody snatches democratic rights.
Every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched away.
Perhaps every person in any country of the world has voted for democracy without following its rest of the rights and requirements for democracy.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a very big election campaign took place in our country, from Amir to the poor, everybody was happy to make changes in the future of our country.
Whenever any goods are very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing effects are also ignored.
This number may seem very common to us, but if I say, if we leave China then more than any country in India had voted.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost twice.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of the entire Europe.
This indicates the vastness and extension of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were the world's largest democratic elections in the history so far.
You can imagine how largely the need for source and manpower would have been raised to fulfil such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and workers can be elected from day-to-day hard work.
When about 3 lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces took their responsibility to successfully fulfil this honour of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also tried their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more votes have been voted than last time.
You can imagine about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 1 lakh VVPET machines across the country for voting.
All this was done so that it could be ensured that no voter is deprived of his voter.
Polling stations were set up for only one female voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two-two days to reach there. This is the true honor of democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also a more proud fact in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
In this election, the percentage of votes for women and men was almost equal.
Another enthusiastic fact that today there are 8 women MPs in the Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth several times that 'Buke not Book', I had urged you to give books instead of flowers in welcome welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
I am very happy that somebody has recently given me a book called Premchand Ki popular story.
Though I couldn't get a long time, I got the opportunity to read some of his times again during my visit.
Her words that express human sensitivity in simple language have touched my mind.
His interactions include the feeling of the whole of India.
When I was reading his words of addiction, my mind was on the economic contradictions in the society itself.
I remembered the days of my youth how discussions were going on overnight.
It is learnt from the words of the brave son of the landlord God and the poor family that if you are not aware then the impact of the bad world is never known.
The second time that touched my heart was Idgah.
The sensitivity of a child, his true love for his grandmother, such a sufficient feeling at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches her grandmother with a chip from the fair, human sensitivity is really at its peak.
In this context, there was a live picture of the problems of the poor farmer's life.
Despite the loss of their crops, the slightest farmers are so happy that they will not have to sleep in the field in the winter.
Though this story is often a century ago, its relevance seems to be the same even today.
After reading it, I felt a different kind of experience.
When there is talk of reading, in some media, I used to read about the letter library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here, P.
Both of them have worked immensely for this library.
There was also a time when books were brought here by tied in the potla and lying on the back.
Today this library is showing a new way to everyone with tribal children.
Wanche Gujarat Mission was a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Lacs of people of every age group participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, I would also urge you to take some time and replace books in your daily daily daily daily routine.
You will really enjoy yourself and write on the Narendra Modi App to read any books so that every person of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are considering the issue which is not only a major challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I have seen that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf, many people have written to me about the water related challenges of Belagavi's Pawan Gaurai, Sintshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar.
Water is very important in our culture.
In Rig Veda 'Ap:Suktam', the water is said to be the source of energy and energy.
Give your blessings like your mother and your blessings will be on us.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised that only 8 percent of the water received from rains is saved in our country.
8 per cent.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also resolve this link with the strength, cooperation and commitment of 1.
In keeping with the importance of water, a new Ministry of Jal Shakti has been set up in the country.
This will facilitate rapid decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country, to the village Prime Ministers.
I wrote to the village Prime Minister that to save water, to save water, to save rain drops and drops of water, he would interact with the villagers by calling a meeting of the Gram Sabha.
I am glad that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, crores of people in thousands of Panchayats performed work.
People in village-village decided to collect one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
On behalf of me, my best wishes to every village Prime Minister and every Sarpanch for their activeness.
There are many such Sarpanches across the country that have taken the initiative of water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has become an opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village are now in competition to build a water temple in their villages.
As I said, a lot of positive outcomes of collective efforts can be achieved.
There can be no forum to come out of the water crisis across the country.
Several efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this.
But everyones goal is the same, and it is water conservation.
The drainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
The life of the people of the village is changing due to the construction of a tank in Thimaipalli, Telangana.
There has been a big change in the small ponds built in the fields in Kabir Dham in Rajasthan.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working well on the Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are together and striving hard, we can also make the impossible possible.
When people join, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am insisting on 3 people.
My initiatives are responsibilities: Just like the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together, we resolve to save every drop of water and I am confident that water is the palace given by God, water is a form of mutuality.
Earlier it was said that with the touch of mutual iron becomes gold .
I say that water is transcendent and a new life is created by the touch of water.
Start a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems, as well as propagate water conservation measures.
I especially urge all the stakeholders of different fields to lead innovative capabilities for water conservation.
Whether it is a film or a sportsperson, our friends of the media, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, people of stories, every person leads this movement in his own way.
Awakening the society, connecting the society and connecting the society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My second response is to the countrymen, many traditional methods have been used for the conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar, worshipped Bapu, then there is another house behind the house of worshipped Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today it has water and there is a system of stopping rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Temple goes to this water tank.
Several such experiments will be done everywhere.
Come, let us inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShaktiHeshteg.
My dear countrymen, I also have to express my gratitude for one thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, on the occasion of Yoga Day, three-thirds of one family, four-four generations came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The awakening for healthcare is increasing the importance of Yoga Day.
In every corner of the world, as soon as the sun rises, if a yoga lover welcomes it then it is a journey till the setting of the sun.
Perhaps there will be a place where there is no human beings and there is no connectivity to Yoga.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to the Submarine, from the airports to the aircraft carriers, from AC gyms to the desert, from the villages to the cities, wherever possible, yoga was done not only at all places but also collectively.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known delegates from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We know that healthy and sensitive persons are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce the Prime Minister's Awards to contribute excellently to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017.
This award has been given to organisations across the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the spread of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and training courses or Ms.
Take the name of Antonietta Rozzi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
It is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a topic related to yoga then can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honoured. He has been dedicated to Yoga for several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and he established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The honour of the massive celebrations of Yoga and the message of Yoga at home, both made this Yoga Day special.
It is a great journey for me to connect with your ideas. Mann Ki Baat is on a daily basis.
Come, let us meet and talk.
Keep listening to your feelings, keep on understanding.
Sometimes I used to try to live these feelings.
Give your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us enjoy Mann Ki Baat and also fulfill the obligations of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, the Mother of India has lost her sons.
We have sacrificed ourselves to protect the lives of millions of Indians.
Our brave sons had united the day and night so that the countrymen could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of brave soldiers in Pulwama's tragic attack, the mindset of the people and people of the entire country is shocked and angry.
There is condolences on all sides of the martyrs and their families.
I salute all the brave dreams of the country who have sacrificed their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to forget the challenges faced by the country, terrorism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terrorism become even more stronger than before.
Our armed forces have been introducing unparalleled courage and valour from time to time.
He has unilaterally shown a wonderful potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also worked to answer their language.
It may have been noticed that how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has pledged to eradicate the whole of the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational issues of their family members have been given strength and strength to the entire country.
Ramniran ji, the father of Ratan Thakur, the martyr of Bhagalpur, Bihar, has inspired us all in this hour of grief.
He said that he will also send his second daughter to fight against enemies and will fight himself if needed.
The entire country is saluting the brave courage of Meenaji, wife of the martyr of Jagat Singhpur, Odisha.
They have also pledged to recruit one of their daughters in the CRPF.
When martyr Vijay Soren's body reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his mother-in-law had said that I will also join the fountain.
The zeal of this month reflects the feeling of one child in the whole of India.
Such feelings are visible in the houses of our brave martyrs.
I urge the youth to know and understand the feelings they have shown by these families.
We do not need to go towards the ancient event of history.
On the Narendra Modi App, Mr. Omkar Shetty, Udupi, Karnataka has expressed his happiness at the creation of the National War Memorial (National War Memorial).
I was also surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India.
This is a memorial where the brave stories of brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build National War Memorial (National War Memorial) and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will dedicate this National Army Memorial to our Army.
The country will make such a small effort to pay its loans.
Delhi's Dil, that is, the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti have come, this new memorial has been built just closer to it.
I am confident that we will be able to go to any shrine to visit this National Soldier Memorial for the countrymen.
This National Army Memorial reflects the gratitude of the nation for the highest sacrifices after independence.
The design of the memorial demonstrates the indomitable courage of our soldiers.
The martyrs of Amar Chakra reflect the immortality of the soldiers.
The second circular is of the bravery cycle, which expresses the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there is a sacrifice cycle.
The Circle showcases the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of the best sacrificed soldiers for the country are written in golden letters.
The defence cycle then demonstrates security.
This circulation contains dense trees.
Together, the identification of the National Army Memorial will emerge as a place where people will come to study their gratitude for their gratitude to know about the great martyrs of the country.
Those who have sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country in words.
Last year, in the month of October, I was also fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be gratitude to the men and women police who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope that you will definitely visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, my thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat continue to be read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your comments, I remembered a very interesting drop of AshishMukhopadhyay ji.
He writes that when British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 2000, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed ji Tata on March 3.
He further writes that these two personalities are completely from different family backgrounds that have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, of paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is equal to bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great scholars have illuminated the name of not only Jharkhand but also the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
Whenever he slept, the British were hiding and holding them with a lot of speed.
Do you know why the British took the assurance of such a vibrant activity
Because the British who raised such a big empire were also afraid of them.
Lord Birsa Munda had shocked the English regime decorated with guns and cannons only with his traditional drama.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, people's collective will power falls on the strength of the handicrafts.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight against the British just for political independence.
But the tribals also fought for social and economic rights.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited, he brightened like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed himself at a young age of 25.
The sons of Bharat Mata like Birsa Munda have happened in all parts of the country.
There will be no corner of India where no one has contributed to this occasion of independence for centuries.
Unfortunately, his sacrifices, valour and sacrifices have not reached a new generation.
If we realize our existence as a person like Lord Birsa Munda, then the greatest institutions like Jamshedji Tata gave to the country.
Jamshed ji Tata was a vision in true sense, who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation stone of it.
He knew very well that it was his vision that it was important for the future to make India a centre of science and entrepreneurship.
As a result, the TATA Institute of Science was established which is now called the Indian Institute of Sciences.
Not only this, he also set up world class institutions and industries like steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country, Morarjibhai Desai, was born on February 2.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the owner of comfortable and peaceful personality, was one of the most relevant leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in the Parliament in independent India is in the name of Morarjibhai Desai.
Morarji Desai made a skilled leadership of India in such a difficult time, which was a threat to the democratic tensions of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai had jumped into the campaign against rivalry to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in old age too.
The government of that time had captured them and put them in jail.
But when he won the Lok Sabha elections in 1917, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provides that the complications of the fundamental rights obtained under Section 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be afforded.
For the first time, it was arranged that only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet, the President would declare the hurdles and it was also decided that the time of the hurdle could not be extended to more than six months.
Thus, Morarjibhai ensured that the manner in which the democracies were killed in 15th century could not be repeated again.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution to maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, this year as well, people were keen on Padma awards.
Today, we are moving ahead on the path of a New India, we want to honour those who are doing their jobs at the level of the foundation.
With their hard work, those who are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true worker, who is unemployed in the service of the people, the service of the society and before all of them.
I want to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked as a marvellous task to revive the traditional disease art of Kutch.
He is doing great work to bring this rare painting to a new generation.
I had gifted to former US President Barack Obama only to the Tree of Life (Life Tree) Culture built by Abdul Gafur.
Sayed of Marathawad is known as the servant of Gaumata in getting Padma Puraskar.
The way he has delivered his entire life to the service of Goddess is incomparable.
You will be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Linch of America.
Even at the age of 100, he is training Yoga to people all over the world and so far one and a half thousand people have been made Yoga teachers.
In Jharkhand, Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzon, took a brave task to deal with Tumber's forgiveness and counterfeits. He did not save just 50 hectares of forests, but inspired 10,000 women to protect trees and wildlife.
Despite being self-sacrifice, it is difficult to get the example of the work done by them for the upliftment of Divyang women and by establishing an institution called Pragyakshushu Mahila Sevakunj, they are working to make the blind children self-sufficient.
He has presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired more than 300 women in their area to join the Self Help Groups and make them economically footsteps.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk about the experience that touches the heart of all those who have been feeling for the past few days.
Today, wherever I go to the country, I have been trying to get some beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
Brothers and sisters, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how many changes are being made in the lives of the poor.
If you all know any poor person who cannot get treatment due to lack of money then tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time of examination in schools is going to start.
Different educational boards across the country will initiate action for the examination of the 10th and 12th standard board in the next few weeks.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their girls and all the teachers who have tested.
A few days ago, a very big event of the Pariksha Pe Dialogue in Delhi was held in the form of Town Hall.
The specialty of the Pariksha Pe Discussion Programme was that there was an open day discussion on various subjects related to the examination.
There are some aspects that can definitely be beneficial for students.
All students can see this entire programme on their parents and teachers YouTube, so my best wishes to all the test warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, India should not be a matter of festival.
Perhaps there should not be any day in our country that does not have any significance, which is not a festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivratri will be celebrated and this time the Shivratri is on Mondays and when the Shivratri is on Mondays, it has a special significance in our minds.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of this Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Kashi a few days ago, I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
So, he said, I am the Prime Minister's interaction.
I really got very impressed with the strength of that Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have a unique experience to connect with you all.
Through radio, I meet millions of families in a way every month.
Sometimes, while talking to you all, listening to your letters reading or sending your phones, I feel like giving me a part of my family.
This is a very pleasant feeling for me.
Friends, Electoral elections are a huge relevance of democracy.
For the next two months, we will be busy in all the elections.
And I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country received a very sad news.
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveswar has taught us - that is, going to fulfil his obligations with hard work, the residence of Lord Shiva is equal to being in Kailasam Dham.
His fame was as a wisdom of English, Sanskrit and Canadian languages.
He was a social reformer.
He pursued his entire life to ensure that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
It was the priority of Swamiji's life that the farmers had every kind of welfare.
Siddhaganga Math was regularly organizing Animals and Agricultural Melas.
I have been fortunate to have received the blessings of the supreme worshipper Swami ji several times.
Kalamsaheb had heard a poem for revered Swami ji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga monastery in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I pay my respects to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is also older than our democracy. I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no need to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, a registered voter, gets the opportunity to vote.
When we hear that polling stations are set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet, there are also far-reaching islands in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Just for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping in mind a voter, he gets the opportunity to use his voter, the entire team of Election Commission employees goes to far-reaching areas and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its constant efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and unsuccessful elections.
This year, the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that youngsters born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
For them, the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become part of the decision-making process in the country.
It is time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they will definitely recognise themselves as voters.
Everyone of us should be aware that becoming a voter in the country, getting the power of vote, is an important place in the achievements of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote. This spirit should continue within us.
If you cannot vote for any reason in your life then it should be extremely painful.
Whenever there is something wrong in the country then it should be sad.
I urge the well-known delegates of the country to make people aware about whether we have to register a voter or vote on the day of voting.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and their partnership will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some unforgettable things for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated their birth anniversary with a different estimation.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
You know that many rooms and buildings were closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have been transformed into a very beautiful museum, the Museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yad-e-Jallian, and the museum dedicated to Indias first freedom struggle in 1985 and the entire campus as Kranti Mandir, has been dedicated to the nation.
Our glorious history is smelled in each of these museums.
The corner of the museum inspires us to go inside the history, the words that present the story of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
At this place, the British rule carried out a case against the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Love Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Kranti Mandir in the Red Fort, the members of Netaji's family gave me a very special topic.
Netaji used to wear this topic.
I kept that top in the museum so that people visiting there also look at the top and inspire patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of our heroes need to be repeated in different ways to a new generation.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December this month.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had hoisted the tricolor five years ago.
Thus, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is such a tradition on August 15.
This was the occasion for the completion of 5 years of the independence of the Indian government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organiser.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with the commendable instruments like Delhi Chalo, Tum Muze Khun, My Tumhen Azad Dunga.
For many years, it has been demanding that the files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we have been able to do that.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We shared a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road connected to Babasaheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or that Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio as an important medium of connecting people as Netaji had a close relationship with radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through radio he interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country.
I was told that the radio stations, weekly news bulletins were also broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Paste and Urdu.
In the operation of this radio station, the resident of Gujarat, M.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Temple .
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture very attractively.
There are four historic exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 paintings and artworks of three centuries old.
The museum depicts excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanendra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Selose Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to look at the works of Jajo and Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore there.
Now you will be wondering that there is talk of art and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has drawn pictures on many topics.
He has also made pictures of animals and birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and afterwards he has also worked to bring human characters to the canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his work.
He believed that those who see their pictures themselves understand those pictures, see the message given by them in the pictures from their point of view.
Their pictures have also been depicted in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely visit the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed a message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was Saint Ravidas.
Ravidas Jayanti is on 1st February.
The story of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Saint Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He said that if God is in reality in every person, it is not appropriate to share them on caste, पंth and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Saint Ravidas ji, through his message, tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime.
He said that it is not wrong that he has explained the real meaning of the prestige of labour to the world.
He used to say that if Man Changa then Kathauti mean Ganga, if your mind and heart are sacred, then Sakshat God lives in your heart.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced every level, every section of people, be it the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or Meerabai, all of them were their followers.
I once again salute Saint Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I have highlighted Indias space programme and the aspects related to its future.
He also wanted me to enjoy students in the space programme and take some different walks and think of going beyond the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and the message given specially to our children.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to countless young scientists of the country.
We are proud that the satellites and sounding tracks developed by our students are reaching space today.
This was launched on 24th January by our students, Kalam-Set.
Sounding rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made many talents.
Since the independence of the country, the space mission has been launched in the last four years, almost as much as the space mission has taken place till 2014.
We have also made a world cycle of launching 104 satellites along with one space yaan.
We will soon recall Indias presence on the moon through Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technologies beautifully in protecting lives.
Whether it is Wazod or Railways and Road Safety, all of them are getting a lot of support from space technology.
Our fishermen brothers have been distributed navigations that help them in their security as well as in economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and responsibilities of government services.
Nearly 40 lakh households of 23 states have been engaged in this scheme 'Home for Children'.
At the same time, about three and a half crore wealth under MNREGA has also been tagged.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
It has a lot of contribution in our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites have been a unique initiative to provide development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our competitive launch services, India launches not only satellites of developing countries but also of developing countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think and move beyond the boundaries that were considered impossible so far.
It is a vision for our children to look after stars and inspire innovative stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the player will emerge and this time many golden and young players have emerged in Khelo India.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
He will also perform the best at the global level when the sportsperson performs at the local level.
This time in Khelo India, players of every State have performed well at their own level.
The lives of many medal winners are inspiring.
I was reading that Ramesh ji, father of the sky, works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shade with his family.
So, the Kaptan of the Under 21 Women Kabdadi team of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Healthy Star.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonali's Hunar.
It is often seen that girls do not get such a boost in sports like Kabbadi.
Yet Sonali chose and performed excellent performances.
Aasansol's ten-year-old innovation Show, Khelo India is the youngest Gold in Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshaya, won gold in weightlifting in Karnataka.
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is a pledge of youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are showing that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India but also the youth and the youth playing talents from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to brighten the toilet
Hey, more than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in a unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is Swachh Sundar Toilet.
With the help of keeping their toilets clean, people are also making it beautiful by making some paintings and you will also get to see many pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanches and villagers to lead this campaign in my Panchayat.
Definitely share your clean beautiful toilets with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a commemorative journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
With the help of the people of India, today, India is moving towards open defecation free long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
The ladies of Mann Ki Baat have also been contributing immensely to this remarkable journey of Swachh Bharat and therefore it is heartening to note that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and Swachhata Coverage in rural India has crossed 8 and about 9 crore households have been provided toilet facilities.
My young friends, the days of examinations will come.
Anshul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about tests and tests.
Anshul ji, thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, the first part of the year is the period of examination for many families.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are engaged in examination related work.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this matter in the Mann Ki Baat programme today, but you will be happy to know that I will be interacting with students from all over the country at 11 am on January 2nd, after two days.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this event.
I will talk to my young friends about all aspects related to the tests, especially the stress-free tests, in this test-pay discussion.
I had urged people to send inputs and ideas and I am very happy that a large number of people are keeping their views on MyGov.
I will certainly put some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall Programme.
You must be part of this program...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, this is the death anniversary of revered Bapu on January 30.
The entire country pays homage to the martyrs at 11.
We must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes wherever we are.
Let us move forward with this commitment to remember the revered Bapu and to fulfill the dreams of revered Bapu, to build a New India, to fulfill our commitments as citizens.
May this journey of 2019 be successfully forwarded.
My best wishes to you all, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do to transform our lives and contribute to the development of the country and society together.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have thought about how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember 2019 as a country and its strength as a people of 130 crore.
It is a pride to all of us.
In 2018, Ayushman Bharat, the worlds largest health insurance scheme, was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's eminent institutions have acknowledged that India is liberating the country from poverty in terms of cruel pace.
With the commitment of the people of the country, the Swachhta coverage is moving towards crossing 5.
For the first time from the Red Fort after independence, hoist the tricolor on the 5th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the world's highest statue of unity was found in the country.
The name of the country has risen in the world.
The United Nations's highest environmental award was honoured with the Champions of the First Award.
Indias efforts in solar energy and climate change have been ranked in the world.
The country's self-determination has got a new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the nuclear triad, that is, now we have become sufficient power in water, place and navy.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by roaming around the world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The country's longest rail-road pool Bogibeel Bridge was dedicated to the nation.
India won the under-1 cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in Para Asian Games.
Yes, if I have been talking about the sermons of every Indian and our collective efforts, then our minds will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this has been possible by the immense efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of India's progress and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to achieve new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, in December we lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing affordable treatment to the poor.
People say they were always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to pay rent to the elderly patients who came to him for treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
He has read many such works that inspire the society on the com website.
Similarly, on 25th December, the demise of Sulagitti Narasamma of Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narasamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
He was honoured with Padmashree earlier this year.
There are many inspirational personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in the society.
When we talk about health care, I would like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the last few days, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors of the city treat the poor free of cost by applying camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors associated with service with selflessness is truly worthy of praise.
Today, I am proud to say that Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness drive in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
When I got the opportunity to read about Jaychandran and when I got the opportunity, Thabeterindia.
I am trying to know such inspirational things by going to com .
I am happy that nowadays there are many websites that are introducing us with many stories that inspire us from the lives of such distinguished people.
Like ThepositiveIndia.
Com is working to spread positiveity in society and make the society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who transform the society.
It is easier to spread negativeness but we are doing a lot of good work around us in the society and all these are being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
In every society, sports is important.
When games are played, the minds of the advertisers are also filled with energy.
We experience a lot of sportspersons' names, identity and respect.
But sometimes there are many things behind it that are ahead of sports, which are even bigger than sports.
I want to talk about the expansion of a daughter of Kashmir, who won the Gold in the Karate Championship in Korea.
Haryana is 12 years old and lives in Anantnagar, Kashmir.
Hannayya studied Karate with labour and intimation and showed him a slight observation.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
Congratulations and blessings to Hinaya.
Similarly, a 16-year-old girl has been discussed in the media.
You must have read.
Rajni won the Gold in the Junior Womens Combat Games.
Rajni won the medal and drank one glass of milk on a stall.
After that Rajni wrapped his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You must be wondering why did Rajni drink a glass of milk
He has done this in the honor of his father Jasmer Singh ji, he sells luxury on a stall of Panipat.
Rajni said that his father has sacrificed a lot to reach this place, has suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work before he got up in the morning and his brother and sisters.
When Rani expressed her desire to learn Boxing before her father, her father encouraged her to get all possible support for her.
Receipt had to be started with old moods because at that time the economic condition of his family was not good.
Despite all such incidents, the hostility of sermons was not defeated and the sermons were learning.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
I extend my best wishes and blessings to the holiday.
And I congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting her and encouraging her.
This month, a 20-year-old girl from Pune, Vedangi, has become the fastest Asian to roam around the world from Kulkarni Cycles.
He used to run about 300 kms of cycle every day for 15 days.
Do we not get inspiration by knowing this kind of achievement
Especially when my young friends listen to such incidents, we also inspire us to show something in the midst of problems.
If the resolution is capable, if it is full of enthusiasm then the obstacles are lost on its own.
Difficulties can never be interrupted.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives.
My dear countrymen, in January there are many festivals full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm like Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttaran, Magh Bihu, Maghi
During this time, the sun enters the Makar Rasi by descending.
After this day the day gradually begins to grow and winter crops begin to cut.
My best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat's feelings in diversity are integrated by our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals and festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered to be different.
There is a good example of our close ties with nature, the calendar based on festivals.
Along with festivals, there is also a list of planets.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and global events is.
The date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and the suncaller based on the speed of the moon and the sun.
It depends on which calendar is considered.
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas according to the conditions of the planets.
All these festivals are celebrated according to the moon calendar, Tamil Puthanda, Vishu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak, Bihu.
In many of our festivals, the value of saving rivers and water is particularly inherent.
Six Festivals - rivers and ponds are connected to sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions of people drown in the holy rivers.
Our festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On one hand, it has a mythological significance, while on the other hand every festival of life is taught very easily to live with each other.
I convey my best wishes to you all for 2019 and wish you a lot of enjoyment for the coming festivals.
Sharing the views taken on these festivals with everyone so that Indias diversity and beauty of Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, in our culture, there is abundance of things that we can proudly and showcase the entire world with respect and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
It would have seen a lot about its magnificence and enormity in films and it would have been true.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
The masses of faith and faith emerge in the Kumbh Mela.
Millions of people from abroad are connected at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is blossomed and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
This time, on January 15, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be held in Prayagraj, which maybe you all are waiting very eagerly.
For the Kumbh Mela the syllabus for the arrival of saints and grandsons has already begun.
Its global importance can also be estimated from the fact that last year UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the list of Integral Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the angels of several countries saw the preparations for Kumbh and the flags of several countries were hoisted together.
More than 150 people of the country are likely to come to this Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj.
With the divineity of Kumbh, India's grandeur will spread its color all over the world.
This can be a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for Kumbh.
There I have dedicated the Integrated Common Control Centre and devotees will get a lot of support in it.
This time a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If there is a cleanliness in the event with faith then its good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotees will also be able to punish Akshayvad after the holy bath in Sangam.
This Akshayvad was shut in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not see.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for everyone.
I urge my brother that whenever you come to Kumbh, you must keep the different aspects of Kumbh and the social media so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
The Kumbh of spirituality becomes the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh also becomes a Kumbh of nationality.
This Kumbh of devotees also becomes the Mahakumbh of global tourists.
This Kumbh of art, also becomes a Mahakumbh of creative forces.
Poojaya Bapu and South Africa have a strange relationship.
He was South Africa from where he became a great Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had launched his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against the distinction.
He also established the Finnish and Tolstoy Forms, from which there was an echo for peace and justice all over the world.
2018- Nelson Mandela is also celebrated as the centenary year, he was also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mande was an example of the conflict against diversity all over the world and who was the inspiration of Mandela
He had the power to live in jail for so many years and inspired him from Pujay Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirations for the entire world, but their ideals always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, the DGP Summit was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the world's highest statue is the Statue of Unity, there was a positive discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen, there was a detailed discussion.
Meanwhile, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity. This award will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that India's strength lies in diversity here.
Respecting Sardar Patel's feelings, I pay homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, on 13th January, Guru Gobind Singh jis birth anniversary is a sacred festival.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For most of his life, his workplace was North India and he sacrificed his lives in Nanded in Maharashtra.
In the birthplace of Patna, Karmabhoomi in north India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole of India received his blessings.
If you look at his lifetime, it gives a glimpse of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of his father, Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had gained the post of Guru in a new year's short age.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight the battle of justice from the Sikh Gurus in Varanasi.
He had a quiet and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to press the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weak and therefore he says that one hundred and a half million boys, Chido Son-Man-Baj Govind Singh ji.
He said that strength cannot be shown in fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Govind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human sufferings.
He was a divine man full of bravery, bravery, sacrifice, compassion, who had an unethical knowledge of both scriptures and scriptures.
He was not only a teerandaz but also a number of languages including Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is happening.
Several programmes are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.

The campaign will run till 2nd January.
India will also be prosperous when India is clean and healthy.
The most important for good health is nutritious food.
You also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
We will meet again in 2019, we will talk about the mind, the life of the person, the life of the nation, the life of the society, the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let us change ourselves and change our country too. I am very grateful to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October, 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a simultaneous journey.
This 50 episode of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
This is the Golden Jubilee Episode Golden Jubilee Episode today.
The letters and phones that have come this time are mostly related to this 50th episode.
On May Goa, development Yadav from Delhi, Amarkumar and Patna, similarly on the Narendra Modi App, Manika Jain, Bardwan, Presenjit Sarkar of West Bengal and musicians from Nagpur have asked about one kind of questions.
He says that many times people connect you with last technologies, social media and mobile apps, but why did you like radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era, why did Modi come with a radio at that time when he had almost forgotten radio
I was a month and I was going to some other place traveling in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal, it becomes cold in the evening, whenever I ordered for tea on a dhaba on the road then it was a small dhaba, a single person used to make tea and sell it.
There was no cloth on top.
The same was standing on the banks of the road with a small larry.
He said, No, sir, you don't know what, it is a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand it, he said, "Look Saheb Radio, there was a discussion on the radio.
The reach and depth of communication, perhaps no one can equip the radio.
This thing has been done in my mind since then and I was guessed about its strength.
So when I became a big Prime Minister, it was very natural to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I took over as a Prime Minister's servant in May 2014, I wanted the unity of the country, its magnificent history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serving of our society, the serving of the people, the pride, sacrifice and sacrifice of the people, all these things should be brought to the people of India.
From far-flung villages to cities, from farmers to young professionals...
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these representatives which are very interesting.
Out of the surveys among the people, the average of 0 is regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has increased the spirit of positiveness in society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movements have been encouraged at a large scale.
There have been widespread discussions on India Positivity.
It is also a glimpse of the feeling of positiveness and positiveness in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also said that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the feeling of doing something with self-sufficiency.
Radio, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Live and Pariscope as well as Mann Ki Baat through Narendra Modi App.
I sincerely thank all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for expressing their faith and becoming part of it.
Your probability is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and if he listens to millions of crores then what should he do
Some young friends conducted a study on all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, all of them analyzed the words of the episode, lexical analysis, and they studied how many times the words were spoken.
Which words were spoken again.
One of them is that this programme has been non-political.
When Mann Ki Baat was launched, I had decided that there should not be any politics in it, neither there should be praise for the government nor there should be Modi anywhere in it and the biggest strength to fulfil my commitment.
Modi will come and run, but this country will be so much, our culture will continue.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
This country will take new inspiration and enthusiasm to new heights.
When will any government have the power to start the zeal of self-reliance dagger from a small village in Haryana and spread not only throughout the country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, every section of the society, everybody is connected and in a new, modern language of thinking in society, which is considered to be the age of today.
Sometimes there is a joke of Mann Ki Baat but in my mind 130 crore people always live.
Their mind is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government talk - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is a special India, an ambitious India.
India's original life is not politics, but India's original life is not even power.
India's original life is society and society.
There are thousands of aspects of society and one side is politics.
Everything happens in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes the incidents of politics and politics are so weak that other talents and other men of the society are buried.
It is our collective responsibility and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction for the bright future of a country like India.
Your question is in a way self-sufficiently asked.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not only to the Prime Minister but also to one of your close friends.
Whatever questions you have asked, if I answer it in a straightforward word then I will say nothing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Every time Mann Ki Baat comes in public letters.
People tell their views on My Goa and Narendra Modi Mobile App. There is also a toll free number - 1800 11800.
People record their messages in their voices by calling them there.
Whenever Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read the thoughts and information sent by you during my visit.
And because of this, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with me.
Later, I record some facts such as the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
In fact, I have sounded in Mann Ki Baat but for examples, emotions and emotions belong to my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to take the name of Mann Ki Baat so far, but they keep sending their letters and their scripts without disappointment - your thoughts and your feelings are very important in my life.
I am confident that you all will get many times more than ever before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
It is also attempted that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat should also focus on letters and suggestions.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
The Akashwani team prepares every episode to be broadcast in many languages.
Some people are efficiently listening to the voices of Modi in regional languages and tons of Mann Ki Baat.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge you all to listen to this programme in your local languages.
I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to my friends of the media who regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
He never feels happy with any political media, he feels that he gets less coverage or the coverage he gets is negative, but the media has made many issues raised in Mann Ki Baat.
There are many topics such as cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with doctors, which the media has worked as a new mission.
This journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete without your cooperation.
In fact, I say I have no secret.
What I am doing will continue to happen in all the families.
In a simple language, I am trying to put myself inside the youth, keeping myself in that situation, I am trying to reconcile with his ideas and make a velocity.
It becomes easier to understand anybody when we are not in the middle of our life.
Todays youth have a lot that they do not do anything that they do not believe in themselves and when they believe in any goods then they leave everything behind them.
Sometimes people discuss the Communications Gap between elderly and young people in their families.
In fact, most of the families are very limited to interacting with youngsters.
In most of the times, the words of reading or the temperament of lifestyle, such a tax, such a tax, is a matter of concern and gradually the words of the open mind have started decreasing in the households.
Discussion will be effective instead of executing and dismissing.
I have been trying to continuously interact with the youth through various programmes or through social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have a store of ideas.
He is extremely powerful, innovative and concentrated.
I am trying to share the efforts of the youth through Mann Ki Baat and their words more and more.
Sometimes there are complaints that youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I want to say that it is good that the newborns question.
This is a good thing because it means that they want to examine all things from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that the youth do not have time to drive. This is the thing that helps the youngsters to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that today's youth is very ambitious and thinks of a lot of big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve great successes.
Finally, this is a New India.
Some people say that younger generations want to do many things at the same time.
What's wrong with that
They are in multi-skiing, so they do this.
If we look around then whether it is a social infrastructure or a start-up or a sportsperson or a big change in society.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and to see a big dream.
If we bring the ideas of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring about positive changes in the country and they are also doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram, Vinita ji has written on May Goa that in Mann Ki Baat, I should talk about the Constitution Day coming on November 26.
He says this day is special because we enter the 0th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vinita ji, thank you very much for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The day of recalling the great descriptions that made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 2014.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 1 days to fulfil the historic work of the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great statistics gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive treaty.
The extraordinary pace of constitution he built is still an example of Time Management and Productivity.
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in the record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the greatest talent in the country, each person was committed to empowering the people of India and the poorest of the poor.
The special thing in our Constitution is that the rights and duties i. e.
Both of them will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected and thus, even if we follow our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected by itself.
I still remember that in 2010, when the Republic of India had completed 60 years, we had taken the luxury of the Constitution on elephants in Gujarat.
It was a remarkable occasion to enhance awareness about the Constitution and to connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
As a republic in the year 2020, we will complete 70 years and 5 years of our independence will be completed in 2022.
Let us all pursue the values of our Constitution and ensure the prosperity, peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of the great man who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly can never be forgotten.
His Mahaparinirvana Day is on 6th December.
I salute Baba Saheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given the right to live with respect to crores of Indians.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say that the democratic values of India have not come from outside.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system - it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he called upon a very emotional one that we have to protect our freedom after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also said that even though we are Indians of different backgrounds, we have to keep the country's interest on all things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on November 23, we all have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Devji and in the next year i. e.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of all humanity.
He always guided the society to the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was meeting with him, I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara at that time.
He had suffered a lot during the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, but the way the state government revived it in collaboration with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has made an important decision to make the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that sacred place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan and Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 episodes, we will meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today, I got the opportunity to keep the previous feelings of Mann Ki Baat in front of you because you asked such questions, but our journey will continue.
The more we will connect with you, our journey will be deeper and will become satisfactory to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
I would like to say today that one thing touches my mind in the representations of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat, it seems that the elders of our family are sitting among us and sharing their own things with us.
When I heard this in detail, I am very satisfying that I am amongst you and in a way I will continue to come again and again through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your ambitions, my ambitions.
Let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, on January 2, 14, the world's famous International Magazine, Time Magazine, showed upon Sardar Patel's face.
In his main story, he had printed a map of India and it was not a map that we see today.
It was a map of India divided in many parts.
Time Magazine wrote that there were threats like division, violence, food crisis, inflation and politics of power on India.
The Time Magazine further writes that in the midst of all this, it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How he guided Bardoli Satyagraha.
Their qualifications and commitments for the country were such that farmers, workers and entrepreneurs, all believed in them.
Whether it was Junagadh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajwada of Rajasthan, it was Sardar Patel whose strength and desert skill we can see a India today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by seeing our mother India, this nation tied in the bond of unity.
On October 31, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
The statue attached to the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is doubled by the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's tallest rocky statue.
Every Indian will be proud of the fact that the world's highest statue is on the earth of India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the land, will now enhance the brightness of the sky.
I salute the family of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why we celebrate this Infantry Day for the citizens of India.
This is the day when the Indian Army personnel had landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the brinks.
This historic event also has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview of Sam Manekshaw, who was a great military officer of India.
He was recalling the time when he was a Colonel.
During this period, in October 14, a military campaign was launched in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was deprived of delays in sending the army to Kashmir. Sardar Patel looked at him at his special budget during the meeting and said that there should be no delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as possible it is resolved.
After that, the soldiers flew into the Kashmir-Bhani flight and we saw how the army succeeded.
On October 31, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, is also a death anniversary.
Indira ji also paid homage to her.
My dear countrymen, I don't like sports.
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Earlier, I got the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes at the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
In these sports, India won a total of two medals and made a new cycle and enhanced India's pride.
I got the privilege of meeting with Para Athletes and I congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summit Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina got the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth have performed the best so far in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also won 3 other medals in the micro events besides 13 medals.
You might remember that this time Indias performance in Asian Games was also excellent.
See, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best so far, the most glorious words so far.
This is the story of today's Indian sports which is touching new heights on the day.
India is not only making new criteria in sports but also in those areas which were never thought of.
For instance, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won Gold Medals for the country in the Asian Para Games 2018.
He is Divyang from birth.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
He later spent the next eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a waiter at Dhaba on the roadside in Delhi to clean the DTC buses for driving life.
Today, in the same Narayan International events, the Gold Medal for India has been winning.
Moreover, look at the growing role of excellence in India's sports, India has never won any synonymous level or junior level or any Olympic medal.
However, Tababi Devi gave history to win the Rajat Medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young player Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer when mother works to sell fish.
There was also a time before his family when he had no food money.
Even in such situations, the courage of Tababi Devi is not hurt.
And he created history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is an inspiration.
Every young player, his luck is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that we had successfully organised the FIFA Under-1 World Cup in 2017.
The whole world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
There was also a new record about the number of spectators in the Fifa Under 1 World Cup.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and increased the respect of young players.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup will start from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian, whether it is a sportsperson or a sportsperson, he must have an appreciation for hockey.
India has had a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many competitions and once the World Cup winners.
India has also given Hockey many great players.
Whenever Hockey will be discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great players of India.
The whole world is familiar with Hockey magician Major Dhyanchand.
After that, Hockey has cut a big stature from Balvinder Singh Senior, Leslie Cloudies, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, team India players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey due to their hard work and attachment.
There is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only enhance the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men's Hockey team for this competition and assure them that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing in their support and I congratulate all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, the self-servicemen are becoming inspirational for all the people of the country.
But in a new era, new generations, new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward to do these things.
Every Indian will be proud to see the enthusiasm and relationship between them for this work.
It is a smell of the journey from IIT to society, I am not hum, not hum, not adult and self-sufficient.
Somebody is teaching children and somebody is teaching old people.
Someone is engaged in cleanliness and is helping the farmers and there is no desire to do all that but there is a selfless feeling of dedication and commitment.
A young man himself learned Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball team of Divyangs.
This is the dedication that is a mission.
Is no Indian proud of this thing
This spirit of 'Main not Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was looking at your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a very interesting drop of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He wrote on MyGov, Please talk about how the traditions and traditions of India's tribes are an excellent example of co-existence with nature.
How we need to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development, some of them need to learn.
I compliment you for keeping this subject in mind Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture. Today, the entire world, especially the western countries, are discussing environmental conservation and finding new ways for balanced life.
However, our India is not free from this problem, but for its solution, we have to do so, we have to see our rich history and traditions, and especially understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Maintaining harmony with nature is involved in the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, especially in the Bhil tribe of Central India, worship trees like peepal and Arjun.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Bishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
In particular, it is permissible to sacrifice their lives in terms of the protection of trees, but they don't believe that a single tree is damaged.
The Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
He considers him as his brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland also tigers are seen as forest protectors.
In Maharashtra, the people of Varali community consider the tiger as guests and the presence of the tigers is prosperous for them.
There is a belief in the coal community in central India that their fate is connected to the tigers and if the tiger does not get food then the village will have to be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the river Kathan during the season of convenience.
They consider these areas as the shelter of fish and this is why they get healthy and abundant fish.
The tribal community builds its homes with natural material and is strong and environmentally friendly.
In the solitary regions of Nilgiri Pathar of South India, a small spreading community and traditionally their settlements are made of locally available things.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with a very peaceful and mutually fair, but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who made a strong fight against the British rule to protect his wild land.
The list of what I have said is very long. There are many examples of the tribal community that we have to learn how to live in harmony with nature and for the wealth of forests that we have saved today.
Let us express our gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and institutions who are doing some extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which look normal at the first glance, but in fact, they have a great impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Gurubachan Singh ji, the farmer of Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh ji's daughter.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry simplicity.
Whether it is life or other things, there is no need to spend any charges.
You will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, what he said, he said, it is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you should instruct me that you don't beat me anymore.
You can imagine how big social power is there.
If Gurubachan Singh ji thinks that he is very valuable, but he shows that his personality is so large and we have seen that there are many families in our society that convert the personal context into the context of society.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh has set a similar example before us.
I have read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near Nabha.
Congratulations to brother Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to Kallar Majra and the people of all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are moving the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just as Tittipe lake is built, small awareness and activity and positive activity always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, our texts say: , , :: It means, O God, peace in all the three worlds, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the sky, in fire, in the wind, in the medicinal plants, in the forest, in consciousness, in the entire universe.
In the heart, in my heart, in the stars, in the corner of the world, establish peace everywhere.
India has a special significance this year on 11th November, as the first World War ended 100 years ago from 11th November, the completion of 100 years i. e.
World War I was an important event for India.
In the true sense, we did not want to take it directly with the war.
Yet our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role, gave the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when war comes, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have demonstrated their bravery in inaccessible areas and in adverse circumstances.
The only objective behind all of them was to reconstruct peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the catastrophe.
According to estimates, about 1 crore soldiers and almost so many citizens lost their lives.
It understood what is the importance of peace all over the world.
In the last 100 years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean just a war.
There is a need to work with global cooperation and coordination from terrorism to transformation, economic development to social justice.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the matter of our Ishaan India is something else.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unparalleled and the people there are extremely talented.
Our Ishaan India is now also known for its best work.
Ishaan India is a sector that has made a lot of progress in biological farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food system.
You will be happy to know that this award given to the best policy decision-making sector is like an award in that area.
Moreover, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for leaving behind 51 nominees of 25 countries for this award.
My dear countrymen, October is going to be over.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for all these festivals.
I would urge you to take care of yourself in these festivals, also take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also be an opportunity to move forward as a mission and take a firm commitment in your lives.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more your progress will be the progress of the country.
My best wishes to you all.
