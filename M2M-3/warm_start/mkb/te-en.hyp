Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
O my beloved country , Namaskar .
The contribution of Deepavali is many luxuries for all of you .
It is said that in this world, light brings comfort, health and prosperity in life, which displays goodwill by destroying opponents.
Festival is a special attraction of tourism in the world .
There are immense opportunities for the festivals in our country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in encouraging Festival Tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something new for this Deepavali in Mann Ki Baat this time.
On seeing this the stories of countless stories in social meditation have been engraved .
This day our parents are in good professions .
She is actually Indian Lakshmi .
Ramesh Garu , my salute to your mother ' s mother .
Their strength of the poets of the poets is Indian Lakshmi .
How pride they feel that their daughters feel good paintings .
She brought good rock in CLAT test .
Megha Jain is coming , 92 years old woman has given water to travellers in Gwalior railway station for many years .
Mughal ji was very proud of the compassion and compassion of this Indian Lakshmi.
Many such stories people are Shering .
You must read, get sporadic.
You should also share such things around you .
All these poets have written a poet in the language of Kannada in the 17th century , my dear countrymen , in the 17th century .
The foundation of all those emotions , those emotions , Indian Lakshmis , now the foundation of all those who have told us is there .
How important things , how important emotions , how excellent thoughts , poets are such in Kannada .
Because of the importance of these artificial artificial artificiality our society is a strong identity , future of excitement .
My dear countrymen, on November 12, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev is celebrated all over the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but all over the world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers and sisters reside , they were completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev .
I have never forgotten the journey done by Vancouver , Tehran Gurudwara .
How much can I tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev, but it has to have several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place .
It is believed that the service done with the emotional emotional emotional emotionality of Guru Nanak Devji is very valuable .
They were opposite to social misconceptions like incontinence .
Shri Guru Nanak Devji has pronounced his message to far off countries of the world .
There are many travellers in their time .
They went to many places and spent their hearts with their humility, humility and simplicity.
Taking the messages of good , equality , they went to all the directions of the north - eastern west , everywhere with people , saints , sages .
It is believed that the famous saint of Assam Shankar Dev also got encouragement with him .
They traveled to the holy Haridwar .
Guru Bagh is a sacred place of Gurudwara in Kashi .
It is said that Sri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Raj Gir and Gaya of Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled to Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During a ' Udasi ' Guru Nanak Dev had visited the surrounding areas of Kashmir in the north.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , at some places also priests .
They also travelled to Islamic countries in a Udasi, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He was inspiring in the minds of lakhs of people who followed their teachings with full devotion.
Some days Christians of approximately 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There the Golden Temple of Amritsar is visited , Guru Nanak Devji has been presented to the glimpse of 550 .
All these residents have got the opportunity to know not only about the Golden Temple , but also about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Devji 's 550 shining festival is my desire to give more encouragement to bring their thoughts , ideals in our lives .
Then once I bowed my head to Guru Nanak Devji .
I believe that my beloved brothers and sisters , October 31 is definitely remembered for all of you .
If you read about Sardar Saheb program , then it is known how strong their planning is .
Thousands of representatives from all over the country have to come to participate in the Congress Conclave in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the responsibilities of the museum were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used to enhance the network of water supply in the city.
Nobody has been organised without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that those people who have been organised without stealing their shoes and shoes at the meeting place.
They contacted the rails , made Khadi bags .
At the same time Khadi Virus also became shining .
Our country is always inspired by Sardar Patel to play the role of Ulkhani in the state council.
As if there is no chance of occurrence of differences on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining the primary haks .
Friends, We all know that the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a great Bhagirathi, historical work has been organised.
Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 our neighbour is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Sardar Patel knew this news immediately that he had taken tough churches without any time .
Similar brothers, Arkat Ramaswamy etc. and Arkat Laxmanswamy etc. were told that the flag hoisted with the people of Travel Corps and the first Trivandrum flag hoisted in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country Trivandrum flag hoisted there , all the neighbours attacked Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep plays its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands , sea shores .
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Patel has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is twice higher than the Statue of Liberty of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
This number has shown the gloriousness of the Statue of Unity about eight and a half thousand people every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared faith , devotion of their mind , apart from this now there are many attractive centres like cotton garden , batter flying garden , jungle safari , children nutrition park , oneness of the local economy .
People get new opportunities every day and many villages are providing home-step facilities in their homes for tourists.
How to develop a place of world famous tourism in a year we are witnesses to this .
People from abroad and abroad come there .
The government has played its role .
Friends, There is no pride in the fact that Time Magazine has given the status of unity in 100 major tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you will be going to see the Statue of Unity for some time in your invaluable time.
Every Hindustani, who wants to travel, will always be in touch with the family of at least 15 tourist destinations in India.
Friends, You are aware that every year from 2014 to 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day.
Today, we have a message to save the unity and integrity of our country.
Like 31 October arrangements are being done for Ran Fort University .
Besides Delhi, in hundreds of cities, in the Union Territories, in the districts, in small towns, in small towns 3 cities, women, villagers, children, youth, elderly, disabled people are also meeting in large numbers.
Nowadays we are watching an interest , holding on Mathan in people .
Ran Fort University is also such a special opportunity .
Run is beneficial for mind , brain body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
Therefore you can know about the Ran Far University around you in which city .
I believe that on 31st October, you will also participate in the race for the unity of India, for your fitness.
My beloved country , Sardar Patel is sitting in the support of the country .
The Ekta Mantra is like our lifestyle and we must be strengthening the unity mantras in every way, in every way, in every corner of the country with diversity like India.
My dear countrymen, our society is always aware of how much the unity of the country is to fulfil the mutual harmony.
If we look around us, many such examples are found in such a way that they are constantly working to increase mutual harmony.
Some self-confidences try to forget those conditions according to their benefits in their own ways .
How many types of things were talking to increase the temperature in the environment .
Try to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some residents , those who go to great places do not speak only to their famous people .
Whatever responsibility we remember .
But all this happens five days , seven days , ten days , but as soon as the judgment came , a joyful , surprising change has been seen in the country .
On one hand it was done to increase the emotionality of two weeks , but on the occasion of judgment on Ramjanmabhoomi the government , royal birds , social institutions , civilizations , civilizations , all the traditions , saints , saints have been published .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But I remember that day well .
The dignity of the Judiciary has been proudly treated wherever there is no chance of motivation and hotness.
These things should always be kept in mind, which gives us strength.
Those days those moments , teach us .
It is an example of how much power gives to the country .
A big injury to the country is a day .
I also pay my tribute to them today .
My dear countrymen, today the stories of the house are listening to a far-flung shore, the story of every village is telling the story from the north to the south, from the east to the west to the roots of Hindustan.
Every person, every family, every village wants to tell his pleasant experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are about thirty crore Indians.
Their fruits are also hundred and fifty crores of Hindus .
There is an experience of thrilling thrill .
Not only separating the garbage in it , it is also a very important task .
In it , removing the glacier around 130 tonnes , which is the biggest service there .
It is also a rare species of snow leopards , where there are rare animals like sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that these Siachen rivers are clean water roots , glaciers .
Therefore the work of making cleanliness gardens here i . . the water of rivers like Nubra , Shyok are used by providing clean water to the lower areas from here .
My dear countrymen, the festival is a festival of awakening a new awareness in all of us.
The meaning of Deepavali i . . buying some new things , every family keeps decreasing more .
I told once to make an attempt to buy things available locally .
If we get necessary things in our village then for this we do not have to go to Tagore .
Once I am telling you many lucks on the occasion of this Deepavali festival .
We are different types of towers for Deepavali .
But sometimes salt gets stuck with carelessness .
My many acquaintances .
Many thanks .

From now on one to two decades Mahatma Gandhi is celebrated by many programs worldwide .
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi gave inspiration to the world .
In 1941 Gandhiji started writing some thoughts in the form of a constructive program .
Then in 1945 when he began to fight independence he made his thoughts everybody .
To save the rulers of worshipping Bapu , villages , workers , cleanliness , education have kept their thoughts before the people of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is specially recognized in his personality .
How important , it is important for the country , Bapu understood everyone .
Then it is said that thy doubt is being done , as thy ego is melting , thou feelest ' Bapu ' .
This mantra of my beloved country , Gandhiji 's mantra is still important .
Today the middle class of the country has increased , their economic power has increased , shopping capacity has increased .
When we go to buy something, remember the supreme Bapu for a moment, remember this mantra that he said.
By shopping this thing I am giving benefit to any citizen in the country .
Whose joy is lighting in the monastery .
I believe that this is his message that the poorest of all, weakest person can bring about a great change in the life of the person.
It is said that if my beloved country , cleansing songs then independence is available .

Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993.
In some days NHRC has been fulfilled .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to enhance our pride.

The NHRC has made a broader understanding for human rights and has also played a vital role in preventing the illicit use of these hiccups.
In this journey of snakes NHRC has prepared a hope , a belief environment in the country .
I believe that this is a big joyful event for a healthy society, for the best democracy.

My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes for our rails to work hard.
Due to strong sunshine dry trees , plants , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season brings the floods of destroying , destroying .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains all rains are natural .
The risks leaving behind them are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know that the soldiers of the soldiers of the soldiers of the security programs happening in Kerala .
They did not leave any opportunity to save those stuck in floods .
They have played a very big role in helping, protecting and protecting the BSF, CISF, RAF and everybody.
I am particularly telling them about the hard industry of NDRF, how much they have helped in such a difficult time.

It is said that the people of Kerala , other places of the country , the whole country is with them , on the other hand I believe all the people of the country .
My dear countrymen , this time I see the signs coming for Mann Ki Baat that I have come more about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
In his messages, many innumerable people like Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Soni Pat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Berji from West Bengal, Akhilash Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, Narendra Modi Yap, My Gauvi Atal Ji's various visions of life.
On the eleventh day of August the world , the world , the country drowned in the sunscreen .
He was a great country which left the prime minister of fourteen years old .
If you want to say one way then he went away from the royal palaces of the last teeth .
People made him the best parlor , soft authority , great word , beloved leader .
Because of bringing the suppression of the suppression of the life of the people the country remains unsuccessful .
We are always grateful to Atal ji because of the 91st State Amendment Act in 2003.
This civilization has brought two major changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that in the number of mantras in the states the number of mantras is fifteen percent in the number of seats .
Atalji changed it .
Therefore money was done . Wildlife Sanctuary .
Because of this the work capacity has increased .
These conditions have begun to increase healthy traditions in our royal culture because of the distant spectacles like Atal ji .
Atal ji is a true patriot .
Change has been changed while entering the budget in their administration .
Initially, as per the tradition of the British, the parlor was held in London, so the evening used to enter the budget at five o'clock.
In 2001 Atalji changed the time of five o'clock in the evening , at eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the states , central states once in the country .
This is a good result of delivery .
To give healthy democracy , excellent democracy , to give good traditions , to empower democracy continuously , to fulfil the churches , etc . all these are also the best devotion to Atal .
In the civilization of the Lok Sabha 100 percent , the work of the state is seventeen percent .
These rainy seasonal meetings in the Parliament always remember social justice and youth development.
In these conclusions many important children used for youth , backward classes have been adopted .
For decades, there is a desire to make the Organisation as well as the SCST Commission.
This time the country has fulfilled the commitment to ensuring the powers of the Backward Classes.
It has also given the authority of a state which takes forward the goal of social justice .
The Parliament, therefore, entered the Bill by introducing the Prevention of Criminal Amendment.
According to this the iniquity of the iniquity of the iniquity of the iniquity of the iniquity is done by training , twelve girls in twelve girls .
A few days ago, you would have been studying in the books and a judgement in Mandashore, Madhya Pradesh, after only two months of inquiries, had executed two injustice in the case of atrocities on the girl.
Earlier, in Kathani in Madhya Pradesh, the injustice was executed only five days after inquiries.
In Rajasthan also, the judges have taken some such fast decisions.
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the injustice occurring on women , girls .
When we move ahead for the country we can bring changes in the lives of poor , backwards , sufferings , children .
In the convenience of rains this time everyone has made an ideal ideal .
All the parlors of the country give thanks to the heart of all the members of the country .
My dear countrymen, these days the eyes of millions of people are on Asian players in Jakarta.

In the middle of this many places rains are coming properly .
At some places more rains are raining at some places .
In some places now people are waiting for rains because of not rains .
The opposite to nature is humans .
That is why sometimes nature has become tired on us .
Therefore we have the responsibility to save nature from nature lovers .
Twelve Junior football sportspersons in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour.
Normally go into that cave, it takes a few hours to come out.
But the decision of that day is in another way .
There was no way to come out , they were near a small dip situated inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but in one and a half days were left .
On one hand if they fight with danger , on the other hand Yavat has exhibited the values of humanity in the world .
The people of the world have prayed to come out safely .
Those children who were stuck , in which condition they tried to know how much possible .
How to take water out if it is not possible to save them in time then it is impossible to bring them out of the rainy season .
Fortunately they were safe , as soon as they were safe , all the world was peaceful , enjoyed .
But how did this immunity program happen to me from the other point of view .
The responsibility found in every level is marvellous .
Government , children , parents , their family members , media , people of the country , all have also been seen marvellously .
In this whole behavior a Jawan of Dhailand Navika had also lost his life .
If we work on our goal with peace , stable mind then it is enough .

It is believed that my young friends keep keeping their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
For the first time, get out of the house, get out of the city, get separated from a fragile environment, it's time for you to become sympathetic.
How many youths come out to give a new direction to their lives for the first time .
All of you have to say that stay calm , spend life joyfully , enjoy your mind in life completely .
Small friends are precious .
But to choose new friends , mixing friends , keeping those friends all this has to be done with very knowledge .
Learn new experts , new languages .
The student of Ashram Chaudari of a poor family of Madhya Pradesh had successfully crossed all the difficult competitions of his life .
Jodhpur AIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS test .
And his father did the work of gathering , and nurtured his family .
My dear countrymen , some days Christians attracted a news that two youths were fulfilling the dreams of Modi .
If reading inside then it is an attempt to bring change in the life of normal person by using our youth technology , creatively .
Once in the city of Sanjoj called technology hub in America I am celebrating with Indian youths .
I would like them to do something for the country by thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Use of their professional experts , both of them have made a smart village yp .
Besides connecting the people of this village with the Yavat world they have to give any advice , information , information , if they have to be available in their own mobile .
In a way, this app is trying to bring digital revolution in the village and it has become easier to record, track and monitor the development of the village through this app.
This app consists of phone directory, news department, Jabita, Health Centre, Information Centre in the village.
In order to know the FACT trait between the village-ficher rails in this app, the market place is used for their production.
If you look at this thing regularly then one thing will be understood that those youths are spending their lives in America , in the middle of the lifestyle , in the midst of thoughts , many years ago , even after leaving India many years ago , remembering the small things of their village , understanding how much psychologically with their village .
Because of this reason they can do whatever need of the village properly .
This relation with their village , its roots , for the country there is a natural place in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , distances , situations , a thin smoke gets stuck on it , but if someone has displayed a small salt then everything inside comes up again .

In the end the idol was built . Apart from anyone , 1929 Mahatma Gandhi had done the idol of Sardar dynasty .
The most important thing is that in the council of that garden the priest is that after coming to Sardar Patel the idol of Tilak is also possible because of his archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeology .
Because of the attempts of Lokmanya Tilak the tradition of community Ganesh Festival started .
These community festivals have become an effective medium for traditional devotion , festivals , social awareness , community , equality and emotions in the people.
Our ancient heritage , history these officers standing in history also know how much interest in our youth .
Today we are watching worshipping the statues of Ganesh in almost every street in many cities .
Together with one hair all the people living in that street are organised .
It is a unique opportunity for our youth to learn qualities such as navigation, management etc.
Good milk , development fruits should be given to every Indian .

Mann Ki Baat June 2018
A historical cricket match has been done in Bangalore for some days .
I am talking about the test match between India-Afghanistan waters.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian to celebrate the first International Match of Afghanistan with our Indian hair.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashraf Ghani, the people of Afghanistan are so proud of their hero Rashid Khan, while placing me in his tower.
For seeing these players I am lying down with our Indian friends to see their everybody .
The best representative of Afghanistan is Rasheed .
Cricket is a heritage of the world .
While taking trophy Indian hair first time the hair of Afghanistan played the hair of Afghanistan also took two trophy mixed on the platform .
What is the sports meaning we can know through this incident .
To unite the society , to explore every participant situated in our youth , to find them sports are a unique way .
I am impossible for two waters of India , Afghanistan .
In the future also we hope to play with each other in the future .
My dear countrymen, on the 21st of June, on the 4th International Day of Yoga, I have exhibited a beautiful view.
Even in the high snow peaks of Ladakh , India , Chinese soldiers have a collective yoga practice .
Yoga is spreading all the borders , everyone 's water .
Thousands of enthusiasm people in hundreds of countries have changed this contribution to a big festival by forgetting all the species , religion , region , sex divisions .
On the day of Yoga the people of the world celebrate so much enthusiasm , why do not the people of our country celebrate it twice with enthusiasm .
The soldiers of our country Bhadrata team , in water , on the earth , three places in the sky have been eaten 125 crore people .
Some of these youngsters do yoga in Jalantagami, some of them have practiced yoga in the snowy hills of Siachen.
These of the air conditioned teams have recognized everyone by putting yogasanas from a height of 15 thousand feet in the sky .
Besides sitting in the air one has to see yogasanas while moving in the air .
Yoga has been done at all places of schools , art galleries , offices , parks , high buildings , playing fields .
One view of Ahmedabad is charming to the mind .
There approximately 750 Divang brothers and sisters were created by yoga at one place .
Across the climate of Kullu, religion and geography, Yoga has worked to unite the people around the world.
Our sages , elephants , saints have always believed the feeling of the family of the Vasuda family coming to tell us .
Yoga has proved that feeling properly .
Those who worship mother as God we consider mother as God .
The role of the doctor does not end only by reducing diseases .
Along with the scientists of doctors along with the scientists the normal lifestyle can have any effect on our health , there is a deep feeling , experience on things .
Indian doctors have recognized their identity in the world with their capacity , other experts .
It is said that our Indian doctors are able to find out the problems of climate along with care , industry living in medical profession .
Through Mann Ki Baat, I express my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of the country on the occasion of Dr.
O my beloved country , how lucky we were born on this land .
There is no historical incident in the history of our country , no one month , no day .
Every place in India has its own heritage .
It is true that on 28th honey I am coming to Maghar .
When I was working at Kabir Wad in Gujarat, I had organised a National Meeting with some people who participated in the tradition of Kabir.
Why do you know the cost of the cost of Kabir Das
There was a belief that if you die in Maghar then you would reach heaven .
It is believed that on sacrifice of body in Kashi heaven goes .
Satpurus Kabir Das was not believed to have seen Maghar in a defective manner.
He tried to destroy the beliefs of the mood situated in his life .
That is why he went to Maghar and sepulchre there .
Kabi Das has dedicated social equality , peace , civilization through his creations , civilizations .
These are his ideals .
This ideal ideal is seen in his creation .
In this time also they are inspirational with us .
One of his writings is, "Kabir Soyi Peer Hy, John Peerzo Peer, John Peerzo Peer, So Ka Peer Me Peer", that is, he who understands the pain of the companions is the best saint.
Kabir Das has shown special attention towards social unity .
He used to think more about the future of his time .
There are other such gurus - Jagadguru - Lord Guru Nanak .
Centuries are giving inspiration .
They say that the service of lice , reproductive service is the service of God .
We are celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Lord Guru Nanak in 2019.
I want to participate in this festival with all of us .
This is a war filled with sacrifices .
There is a history tied with Punjab .
Jalianwala Bagh accident done by embracing humanity is completed in 2019 .
Who can forget that dark day of 1919 , April 13 , April .
During the reign of English , Kolkata University is the first time in the language of bathing .
Doctor from 1947 to 1950 .
In 1948 the first industrial method of independent India , his thoughts , his darshan came with the seal .
Among the factories established by Mukherji, Chittaranjan Locomotive Works Plant, Hindustan Aircraft Plant, Red Plant in Sindri and Damodar Ghati Corporation are all the four successful projects.
Dr . Shyam Prasad Mukherji is also a big support in the establishment of the rest of the Reverse Valley project .
People told about their contributions , their happiness , their customs .
A brother of Chhattisgarh has made ice cream with them .
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are providing affordable medicines to the surrounding villages as well as walking at Jan Aushadhi centres.
A young man of West Bengal is now successful in discovering two-three industries .
Besides this ten and fifteen people are giving their jobs .
In the schools of Tamilnadu , Punjab , Goa students are working on the main objects like management with irregular substances in the ticketing lab of school at their young age .
There are many such stories . people do not have any place in the country without telling their victory .
In such a environment if common people talk about incidents happening in their life with new hopes , new enthusiasm then it is not important for the government .
The incident of a small child situated on the other side can also inspire the people of hundred crores of countries .
I am lying down to the people of the country .
40 , 50 lakh people participate in this video bridge program , give me new energy .
On the second time I told you that I am falling .
We can enjoy the aroma of that goodness .
A few days ago, one thing came to me, this is an important meeting.
In this there are one bed engineers , professionals . Our brothers and sisters working in the fields , agriculture .
Not only this, those rails who are not able to yield one kind of fruit in their fields, they are not able to yield more benefits, they are also getting better benefits by their own marketing.
The rails of pulses are also connected with this train .
To increase the fruits properly , for its right seeds specially a sead bank has also been made .
On the second time I have told this country for their experiments , I have not known them , do not know them , do not know them , do not know them , do not know them , do not know that many people do good for their constant efforts .
One nation, one tax is the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to express my gratitude to one nation, one tax reform.
GST is an important example of cooperative federalism and all the states have decided to take decisions for the benefit of the country and such a big tax reform has been implemented in the country.
But all the decisions taken by this GST Council have also been taken with everyone .
There were 17 different types of teeth in the country before GST, but after organising this system one teeth came into force throughout the country.
Before this in the country many times in the matter of teeth the cannons were coming on Ajamaishi .
Refund from refund is done only through infection technology in online .
However, in a year, this new teeth system has enhanced its place and has also made changes through its manufacturing system, as a result of the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the realistic people in the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I am waiting for the Maan Ki Baat programme for the second opportunity to talk to you.
All of you are many luxuries .

All these adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous games .
My dear countrymen , especially my young friends , two months ago when I told about fit India then I did not hope so much .
It is said that in such a large number of people from every place they do not want to Madhuban .
When I talk about fit India , I believe that how much we play , the whole country plays as much as possible .
In social meditation people are divided the video of fitness .
One of them is consulting each other .
Everybody is participating in this fit India .
If the films of films , players of the country , or the chiefs of the country , soldiers of the army , school students , all around , then it is said that the country is fit .
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, I have sports sportspersons, some of you are listening to me.
The players of Commonwealth Games have also divided their opinions with us through the program of Man Ki Baat .
Thank you, Chhavi Yadav, thank you for calling the phone.
Not only this , some games participating in every child 's life are gradually lost .
These games have a special place in summer holidays .
Once in the burning sensation , once after eating in the night , without any worry , all the children used to ask all these games for hours .
Some games were playing all the family .
The unity hidden in diversity in our country is also seen in this game .
One game is known by various names in different areas .
I have a sportsperson from Gujarat, which is called 'Chomal Isti'.
It used to play with laughter, worries or dice, 88 square board.
This game used to play about every state .
It is called Chaukabara in Karnataka. There are many names like Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam in Tamil Nadu, Tham Ani and Lochangapo in Rajasthan.
In Andhra Pradesh this game is called guides or carpets .
In Orissa , Gulbadi is called Ani , Maharashtra .
There is a time to play some games .
There is also a time to fly air .
I mean, how to accomplish goals, how to establish firmness, how to learn team spirit, how to cooperate with each other.
If we play these games from children to mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers and mothers then the international levels of generations also become so good .
Along with this we also know our culture , traditions .
Several games give us better about society , environment etc .
In schools , streets , youths come forward and encourage these games .

Behaving softly towards nature , protecting nature is our natural nature .
Keep in our culture .
In the last few weeks, sand storms have come in different parts of the country and heavy rains have also occurred due to these bambooes.
All these are also actually changes happening in the environment specimens , their results .
Our culture , our tradition has not been able to teach us with nature .
We should be in harmony to nature .
Mahatma Gandhi had dedicated this poison in every step of life .
If we talk about the environmental justice of India , copper 21 and Paris have played a major role in the agreements of Paris , through the International Solar Alliance , the Yavat world stands at one threshold , behind all this is a thought to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi .
If we want to make our planet clean , green , then on the day of this environment we think all of us .
In this direction we can move ahead .
My dear countrymen , especially my young friends , you have remembered 21 June properly .
Not only you , the whole world remembers 21 June .
By doing yoga it gives us courage to save us .
When all these qualities are drowned in each other then yoga gets victory on all kinds of fears .
We have to walk ahead of our heritage yoga once again I want to all the people of the country .
In the year 1857 in this month only our Indians had shown their success to the British .
In many places of the country our soldiers , rails were standing against unrighteousness .
It is a matter of sadness that we have to say that for a long time 1857 incidents were only adventurous churches , soldiers rebelliously .
But in reality not only estimating that incident , it is also an attempt to hurt our self-confidence .
It happened in 1857 not only incitement but also in our first freedom struggle , he wrote daringly .
Savarkar is a person with many specialities .
He worshipped both weapons , hospitals .
Ordinarily he reminds of the soldiers of these soldiers , and reminds him of the fight against the rule of the British .
Besides all this, he was also a bright poet, a social worker, who always gave strength to harmony, unity and feelings.
Our beloved prides of Atal Bihari Wazpai had discovered a marvellous description about Savarkarji .
Atal Bihari Wazpai is the right picture .
Savarkar poets walked with both poets , cramps .
Our children are unsuccessful as if they are not able to make the household security then the poor people are cutting their clothes to cover their body .
I am telling the bright future of these children filled with hope , confidence .
If there is a desire of any museum , then it has been proved that victory can also be successful in the middle of many difficulties .
This is not only a matter of Sikar region but you will find many such things in every corner of India.
Because of your place , surrounding you will be able to take care of yourself how people are standing by winning their situations .
While standing near some tea , while enjoying the taste of tea , people living bed listen to their churches , opinions , examinations .
If you are surprised to hear that more than fifty children running a simple tea then you will be surprised to hear .
For children living in Basti , Puri hutsal a school has been started with the name of ' Ashwasan ' .

Who does not tell the word of ' Jyotirmaya ' .
But the word was seen alive .

In the middle of this many youths use their time to learn some new thing .
Internship is a new experience .
That is why one gets the opportunity to know the feelings of new life away from the four walls , paintings , computer .
My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
A Swachh Bharat Summit Internship 2018 was launched by Departments of Government of India - Share of Sports, Share of Human Resources, Drinking Water, etc.

For a new feeling , to learn anything we used these camps .
My dear countrymen, whenever I got the opportunity, I would like to see the Good News India programme in Doordarshan.
Together with this youth group a big campaign has been done for the reading of children living in dirt .
Initially they were so much moved to see the conditions of children living on the roads , how much they were moved in such creative work .
Initially this propaganda started with fifteen children of the dirt situated near Gita Kalni of Delhi now two thousand children in the capital .
The youths , educationalists , students enjoying their unforgettable daily routine for two hours , this Bhagirathi is in an attempt to change the society .
Brothers and sisters, Likewise some rails from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have worked inspiration for all the rails across the country.
They have changed their place apart from their incidents .
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, only fruits like bullock wheat, gardens, corn, barley etc. are grown.
Because of being the hilly area these fruits are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot area have discovered the way to increase the price of selling these fruits directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits these iron substances are very beneficial for pregnant women .
In Munar village all these rails have been organised a government institute , where these biscuits have been opened .
On seeing the bravery of the Railways, the Government has also visited the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district besides Almora , Kausani .
We hear that in future people of my beloved country , wars take place for water in the world .
Everybody says this thing but nobody remains responsible .
The cost of water conservation is a social responsibility .
How should we take care of each rain .
We all know that the conservation of water is not a new thing for all Indians .
Not only the subject of books . language is not a matter of beauty .
For centuries our ancestors have seen it by us .
We know how much importance they gave every drop of water .
How to conserve each drop of water they have seen new ways .
If there is a chance of going to Tamilnadu then in some big rocks built in some temples water conservation system , water conservation system , dryness is written in hand .
If you go to the temples like Manar Kovil , Chiran Mahadevi , Kovil Patti or Puducherry etc . then you will find big rocks at all places .
We are also aware of the various descendants and tourist destinations, but we should not forget that the efforts made by our ancestors to conserve water.
The UNESCO World Heritage Sits have recognized Adlaj Digdubavi of Gujarat and Patan Rani Digtubavi of Patan.
If you want to say one way then do the temples of water .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must see Chand Bawadi of Jodhpur .
The budget of cataract also works for the conservation of this water .
In the last three third three times the conservation of water , in the direction of the construction of water everybody has made their efforts .
On the conservation of water from the budget of cataract , on the construction of water an average of 32 thousand crores has been spent .
If you want to say about 2017-18 , in the whole of 64 thousand crore rupees i . . about 35 thousand crore rupees have been spent for water conservation .
In the last three years such water conservation , water conservation has been beneficial for 150 lakh hectares land through the medium of water conservation .
Some of the funds received by the Government of India for water conservation, water conservation have been very beneficial.
But in Uttar Pradesh, in some other areas, two small rivers like Sasur Khadri in Fatehpur district have dried up.
The part of the district instrument has put India on itself in large numbers of soil , water conservation programs .
With the help of approximately 40 - 45 villages this dry Sasur Khadri river has been renovated .
This reservoir used for animals , birds , rails , fields , villages is successful in filling with blessings .
Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is a person full of knowledge , scientific personality .
On hearing the poems like joy , agnor , Portuguese , etc . there was a chance of listening to the poets in the mind .
You will also affect Ravindra music , their poets .
I am honouring the grand Anjali of Ravindranath Tagore.
The month of Ranjan is celebrated with full faith , pride .
The feeling of fasting is that if man himself is hungry then he does not understand the hungry in front of him .
If he is thirsty then others feel thirsty .
This is the time to remember the education of Pagbar Mohammad Saheb .
Our responsibility is to walk on the paths of equality , brotherhood .
Therefore in the month of sacred Ranjan donation is given .
My beloved country , Buddhapuri is the main day of every Indian .
It is a matter of pride that this land of Mahamani , Buddha , Lord Buddha , who had seen the three powers of compassion , service , sacrifice , this is the way to many lakhs of people worldwide .
The responsibility of all of us to walk on the way to see Lord Buddha , try to travel on the way to see them , remind this Buddha Purnima once again .
Lord Buddha is the strength of equality , peace , harmony , brethren .
Such human elements are more in the world today .
Babasaheb .
Ambedkar ji had said that in his social philosophy there was a lot of inspiration from Lord Buddha .
Not only this , there is no important example of compassion .
Such compassion is one of all the important qualities shown by Lord Buddha towards the problems of people .
In many countries like China , Japan , Korea , Thailand , Combia , Myanmar etc . this Buddhist tradition , Buddhist teachings are included in their roots .
I am very happy to be participating in the renovation programmes of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent joyous temples of centuries ago in Bagan, Myanmar.
To make a peaceful , compassionate world with Buddha 's blessings I pray to bless all the world of Lord Buddha .
While remembering Lord Buddha, you will be listening to the idols of Lafing Buddha, the idols of Lafing Buddha are lucky.
That day also Buddha Purnima .
On May 11, 1998, it was used in Pokhran in Rajasthan on the western borders of India.
If you want to say in one way then India has exhibited its strength in science , technology areas .
On that day , in the history of India , the soldiers of the country are dedicated in the form of exhibition .
Internal Strength meaning how important is the peace of the internal strength Lord Buddha has seen the world .
So, when we stand as a strong country, we can be peaceful with all of us.
It is not only important for the country to use only in the month of May 1998 but how it is important to celebrate .
India has seen the world as a land full of some important scientists and has a strong narrative that India can consistently achieve new maziles and high peaks.
Atal Bihari Vajpei had given the mantra of Jai Jawan , Jai Kisan , Jaisan .
This time, on May 11, 1998, we are going to celebrate twenty-seven years of completion, and in this context, we must contribute to the creation of a modern India, to build a strong India, and to build a strong India.

Because of the treatment of 13 years ago , the brother of cab driver of Kolkata died .

In a way Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar had laid the foundation of the new energy of India .
He spoke of the importance of the United States, the community and the central and the state do not want to work together to bring the nation into development.

Mann Ki Baat February 2018
This question has given an important scientist to our modern India .
Earlier, when we talk about science, India Sir C.
His research is famous by the name of Raman Effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the main past scientist Bodhgaya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Ayurveda etc .
On the other hand in the field of treatment we were prideed .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose , Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India .
The name of Satyendranath Bose has also been named as the main parlor BOSON .
In the meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai. This is the invitation of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles happening in science .
Through artificial intelligence, robots, boots and other specific work instruments are helped.
In between this instruments also increase their own intellegence even more .
This technology is useful in glittering the lives of all lice , lice , lice , needy people .
Is it possible to get any help from Artificial Intelligence to change the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters in that program
I got the opportunity to visit the I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, with the Prime Minister of Israel in a few days.
There I saw a digital disorder made a young man .
I want to use artificial intelligence in many ways.
The price of science and technology is stable .
There is no price for them .
How we want every instrument , only works .
But by the instrument we do some work which depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is important .
Science should not only be used for human welfare but also to climb the best peaks of human life .
Thomas Alva Edson had successful in his research many times in his research .
Yadrichchikamu, fortunately, is that I am in Auroville, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
Similarly in the form of a Maharshi he questioned everything in life .
They were also seen the way to humanity .
How important is the question to know the truth every time .
I am telling all the scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists .
Friends, I have many messages on safety, desert etc.
In a message sent by Ravindra Singh from Pune to the Narendra Modi Yap, he proposed the occupational safety.
He said Safety Standards are not very important in our country where factories and construction works are being done.
On the 4th of March, the National Safety Day, he asked the Prime Minister to showcase some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat programme, to increase the awareness of the people.
In daily life we do not take precautions about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata during dangers .
If there is a lack of concentration then there is a danger - one error destroys the joy and laugh - do not break the bonds so quickly - do not play with Bhadrata - do not play with Bhadrata - do not lose life like this.
By crossing that path all the times in our life can not be used .
But if the natural alternatives are left , then most of the dangers occur due to our layer .
If we are best, if we take necessary precautions then not only can we save our lives but also save our society from big risks.
Once there are many signs about Bhadrata at the place of working but nobody participates properly .
I want to make a drill in front of the children of various schools once in a week , once in a week , once in a week .
This country has faced many chemical , industrial accidents .
Now the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is organizing major seeds in the country.
On occurrence of various types of dangers like earthquake , floods , storms etc . , when there is rescue operation they reach there along .
Besides this they also keep training programs for capability building .
In the districts coming to floods , temporary temporary training a program has been done by the name of a campaign .
How important role is training , best role .
Two-three Christians, i. e.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to hot gardens is less than 220 near .
Therefore it is known that we give importance to Bhadrata , we can be safe .
If there is a danger in the society then innumerable people , social incidents , best civilizations , best civilizations .
Under the leadership of India, BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have conducted a joint discipline management exercise.
This is a first , great human use .
They should be part of our life .
Normally we are traveling in the airways many times and in the beginning of the air travel we are giving information about air hostel Bhadrata .
All these signs are also listening to us many times .
But if someone takes us to the airways , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can definitely say that nobody in us is alright .
There is a chance of seeing them directly .
That's.
But we keep in mind .
That's why we are sitting in the air or listening to the precautions of our ears, but some of us are saying that they are our desires.
We feel as if we are in every hole of life .
We do not consider this Bhadrata for us .
If all of us are best for our Bhadrata then the society is also in it .
My dear countrymen, this time, in the budget, wealth to wealth, waste to energy, i. e.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galvaning Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this Gobar Dhan is not only to clean the villages, to make the livestock litter, and to convert them into COMPOST, BIO-GAS, but also to produce wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore and their lice is thirty lakh tonnes.
Some European countries , Chinese cattle , remaining centres are responsible for producing energy .
But in India it is not useful in complete level .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set to generate bio-gas based energy from the wastes available from cattle licensing, centres, etc.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, rural brothers and sisters in India have to be encouraged not only to see the poor and the poor, but also to provide money.
The health of animals shines and their production increases.
Due to bio gas the capacity of cooking , lining cosmetic cosmetics increases itself in the matter of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the arrival of rails , animals .
New jobs increase for west collection , transport , selling , etc .
The Gobar Dhan Yojana is also a online trekking platform for smooth movement of rails and shopkeepers.
I am delighted to come forward with businessmen, especially the sisters living in rural areas, and to make the Self Help Groups and Cooperation Self Help Groups.
I would like to invite you to participate in the Garden of Clean Energy and Green Jobs so that you can not change the waste in the villages in a way to make Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about various festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival etc.
However, in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first ever Festival of Employment was organised by a special effort.
The Festival, which was launched by Raipur Municipal Corporation, aims at ensuring cleaning and creative use of the city, is to provide awareness about various methods of reuse.
Everyone participated in various programmes under this festival to the elders of the students.
Inspired by Raipur , in some other districts also vain festivals have been done in various ways .
Every seventh March the International Women Festival is celebrated on eighth day .
There are many programs in our country , worldwide .
That is , we are talking about the development of women - leadership by walking ahead of the growth of women .
In this context, I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda, he said that the idea of perfect vanhood is perfect independence - the opinion of Swami Vivekananda about a hundred and fifty years ago, shows the spirit of women's strength in Indian culture.
In the tradition made by the identity of men we were participating in the tradition of women . Yashodan , Kausalya Nandan , Gandhari sons , this is the identity of every son .
Now I got some information from Jharkhand .
Around fifteen lakh women in Jharkhand, not a small number, but fifteen lakh women have come together for a month.
In this propaganda starting from 26th January 2018 , only in twenty days these women have made a new example of one lakh and fifty thousand .
How big incidents you can imagine this .
Jharkhand women have proved that to change the cleanliness in normal life , cleanliness culture , normal people can try to change the natural way of normal people .
Brothers and sisters, I have seen in the newspapers two days ago that after the independence of three villages of Elephant Islands, I had seen how much joy in the people there.
All of you know well , Elephant Island is located at a distance of ten kilometres from Mumbai .
I am telling the government , people there .
The cost of the life of the country is shining , enjoying the joy in their lives is even more enjoying and happy moments .
My beloved brother brothers and sisters , Italy we celebrated Shivratri Mahotsav .
Now with the artistic fruits of the month of March , golden coloured wheat , the beauty of mango thrilling heart , all these are also special in this month .
Holi festival coming to this month is also very favorite for all of us in this month .
On the second day of March the festival of Holi is celebrated with joy .
The more important is the importance of colors in the festival of Holi , the more important is the burning of Holi .
Forgotten all the diversity of the mind , everybody sits together , enjoying each other , Holi meaning this festival gives messages of love , immenseity , brotherhood .
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat in 2018.
Two days Christianity we celebrated the day of our Ganapati .
The students of ten countries participate in this festival for the first time in the history of the country .
If they come to the space of February , then the imagination of the imagination of the imagination of the imagination of the imagination of the space .
In the accident of the space of Colombia we left us , inspired some lakh youths worldwide .
If there is a desire , strong contribution , if there is a desire to do anything , then it is not impossible .
On this day all women in India are increasing the pride of the country while developing in every hole .
Since ancient times the pride of women in our country , their support in society has been surprised to the world .
There is a tradition of all the opposites in India .
In the Vedasara museum there are many Indian scholars along with Indian scholars .
Our memories like Lopadra , Gargy , Matrai .
Now we are reproductive like ' children ' , reading children ' but for a long time in our scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science .
The pilgrimage occurring due to ten sons is available only with one daughter .
It shows the importance of women in our society .
Witnesses like Lopamudra, Gargy, Maitrey
The arrangement of Ahlayabai Holkar was done . Rani Lakshmibai has always been given inspiration to us , protecting the pride of the country .
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given many examples.
Our adventurous security mantra Sitaraman has given inspiration to all the women on the journey of 30 warriors .
Three adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous training .
Under the leadership of Shamta Vajpei, All Women Crew, from Delhi to Sanfrancisco, USA, again runs Air India Boating Jute to Delhi.
They say properly - apart from queen of women in every hole they are coming to the leadership .
In every hole of these women are showing something or the other .
A few days Christian President had started a new work .
To know about the strength of this woman in the country, to get inspiration from her life and from her work, a book has also been made on these women acquaintances.
This is available in the Narendra Modi website in the form of this book.
In the social changes happening in the society of the country , the women of the country have an important role .
Now we are talking about the capacity of women therefore I want to tell about a railway station .
You can consider what is the relationship with a railway station cool, a woman's capability.
The Matunga station of Mumbai is the first railway station of the country full of women soldiers .
There women are in all the parts .
In the Department of Commerce, in the Railway Police, in ticket checking, in the Anonymity Sibbadi, the Point Person, and more than forty women.
This time after seeing the Ganesh Festival on the day of Ganesha many people were recognized by the tower , other social meditations .
The view of this adventurous experiment has also surprised all the guests coming from abroad .
This is a form of self-confidence of women .
These are our women coming to the leadership .
Occurrence of self-confidence .
The other thing has come to me is that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have done a great job and have seen a great example.
A certain picture is seen in the mind of all the women that is , one wildlife , in which the pictures of women running on the heads of the head are seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture to the country.
Maoists have created a horrific environment with oppression, atrocities, bombs, temporaries in the Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this-rickshaw .
At the time of hypertension many women were included in it .
Therefore three benefits are being done . On one hand self-confidence has made them self-confidence .
Leave unconsciousness in our hands , adopt changes in important places .
It is a speciality of our society to fulfil itself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been given us heritage .
Some days Christian Bihar has taken a new wave program .
The biggest human habit of the world more than thirteen thousand kilometres to encourage the bad ways of the state with fingers .
Through this program people were opposite to the marriages of child marriage , Varakat opposite opposite to the opposite opposite .
The opposite to the opposite to the bad ways like child marriage , virginity etc .
Children , elders , enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
From the historical Gandhi plains of Patna etc . this human hall has been associated with the borders of the state .
If all the people in the society have the right result of development, then the society should be free from bad ways like home.
Come , let us make such a bad ways together from the society .
We will build a strong, capable India in a New India.
I am impressing the people of Bihar state , the main minister of the state , the administrative instruments there , every person participating in that human society in the direction of their society so special , extensive effort .
My dear countrymen, the visitor to MyGoape, Karnataka, was spent six thousand per month for their grandmother's treatment.
Before them the prime minister of the prime minister is told about the physiotherapy .
After knowing about the centres of population medicines started buying medicines there , his cost of medicines decreased 75 percent .
The medicines found in the centres of population medicines are available in the market for fifty to ninety percent of the medicines sold in the market .
Therefore normal people , especially medicines are available to old ages .
Because of this reason good quality medicines are available at less cost .
Three thousand people have been established in the whole country .
Therefore apart from getting cheap medicines there is also a chance of trade for traders .
Medicines at affordable prices are envisaged in the centres of Indian Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi and in the hospitals of Amritsar Stores.
The objective of this scheme is to create a healthy and prosperous India by providing quality healthcare to every poor person in the country.
My dear countrymen, the Mangesh of Maharashtra sent a photograph to Nrendra Modi Yap.
There is a photograph to rotate my eyes towards that side .
One of them is playing in the program of cleaning the Clin Morna river connected with his own teeth .
The people of Akola decided to undertake Swachh Bharat programme to clean the river Morna.
The river Morna flows in twelve months and now it flows only in a few months .
Another painful thing is that the river is full of horse riding .
The shore of the middle is also very bad .
Therefore, on the eve of Makar Sankranti, the first part of the Mission Clean Morna was constructed on the eve of January i. e.
Large changes can be brought through procedures .
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the people of the district, to the city, to the people of the city, to the people of the city and to their efforts.
You will have to listen to the churches happening on my beloved country , in the middle of this place .
Our attention attracts our attention on this matter .
There is a tradition of giving every year Padmasam prizes but the process of Padmasam has changed .
Now nobody can do this book .

His goal is to give inspiration to use scientific uses with unsuccessful objects .
Therefore on going to three thousand schools of the country he is giving inspiration to children by looking at the films made in 18 languages .
How wonderful life .
You must have heard about the Bajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, which is a poor tribal family.

This expansive expansive expansive expansive excitement has also brought him the worldwide not only in India .
These pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy .
In the foreign countries the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of India , gave him Padmasri .

The teachers in Kallar are still living in ponds built in the dense jungles of tribal areas.
On the basis of his memory five hundred medicinal medicines are made .
In making medicines used for snakes it is impossible .

In the hospital built with how difficulty many thousands of lice are being treated freely .
Everybody should hear their experiences by calling school , art galleries .
Crossing the books also some attempts should be done in the society .
Every year we celebrate the ninth January .
Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa on this day .

Some Indians living in different countries of Europe work in cyber security, some were dedicated to Ayurveda.
I express my gratitude to the Ganu Irope Church for informing the people of the world about not identifying the people of Indian origin and Indian origin.
January thirty and thirty lights showed the right path to all of us .
On that day, we celebrate the day of the martyrs and pay homage to the great martyrs who laid down their lives for the protection of the country for eleven hours.
They are not only the principles of poetry .
Nowadays also we are seeing the words of Bapuji in reality .
What is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
Mann Ki Baat December 2017

Jesus Christ was told about the most service .
We also see the efficiency of service in Bible.
My dear countrymen , in this year the fifteenth Sikh Guru Govind Singh 's 350th birth anniversary was celebrated .
The life of Guru Gobind Singh, full of sacrifice and adventure, is a wonderful example of encouraging all of us.
Guru Govind Singh had preached the importance of life which he spent his life while singing them .
A guru , philosopher , great warrior Guru Govind Singh singinging in all these utensils were so fond of people living in all these utensils .
He fought against the opposites , unrighteousness .
He taught the way to bring the bonds of Kullu , Dharamshala .
In these attempts he had to lose how much personality .
But he never let the feeling of hate reach .
In January this year, I am fortunate to get the opportunity to participate in the 350th Annual Festival of Guru Gobind in Patna Sahib.
Those who were born 2000 or later , that is , in 21th century everyone who was born in 2018 , January .
You may also be feeling the feeling of pride of 21th century .
You can also be the construction of the 21st century India . This January is a honeymoon of this January .
In this Mann Ki Baat, I want to talk to our prominent youth full of 25 years of age.
I consider all of them as a New India Youth, a New India Youth, aspiration, enthusiasm and energy.
I believe that with this powerful youth, our dream of New India is fulfilled with strength.

Mahatma Gandhi had changed the democracy of independence .
The person filled with social , enthusiasm is not impossible .
There is an essay in English called 'Pacifism Leads to Weaken, Optimism to Power'.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I would like to welcome the people of the country to share their best experiences in 2017, in an atmosphere of harmony.
I am happy to share their experiences with a large number of people through MyGov and Narendra Modi App through social media.
Lacs of forests coming with nutritious India Hashtag have reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this suitable propaganda spreads from India to the world.

Some people also divided their personal victory .

The work done by such people from their levels brings about social changes in many lives.
If you are talking about the point of view of social point of view then I also have to divide one thing .
In the meanwhile, I knew the inspirational story of Shri Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak Taluku, who was standing in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He stood as a topper in the examination of Kashmir Administrative Services, escaping from acute hatred and hatred.
In 1990 the acute people burnt the house of their ancestors .
There rapidity , hyssop is so much that their family had to leave their ancestors .
All around this positive environment is enough to fill blind , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Ajum did not let it happen .
He never did hope .
He chose a new way for himself and the way to serve people.
He came out of the opposite environment and came to his victory stories .
Now not only in the region of Jammu and Kashmir but also in the youth of the country is an inspirational example .
Even if the situation is not so good then it has been proved that the clouds can be discovered by the suitable works .
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
When I hear about their captivity , enthusiasm , dreams , how many kinds of progress in their lives they know in their hopes .
When I talked to them I could not see anywhere in them .
They have enthusiasm, power, dreams, concept.
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
My dear countrymen, not only in our country but also in the famous religious areas of the world, the proposal about the house of Shabarimala of Kerala is natural.
For the blessings of Appa Swami in this world famous temple every year devotees come here in numbers of crores .
How important is the devotion of all the devotees coming to the place of devotion , sanctuary , how many acquaintances are there .
Especially because of being a place situated between the hilly areas , forests it is even more difficult to sing cleanliness .
But not discovering this problem , not changing the problem properly , how to find out the way out of the problem , this is why the temple of Shabarimala stands as an important example to find out the support of the people .
Shri P.
The pilgrimage of Vijayan was started a program named Pungavanam .
Every traveller is called for some time only in the worship of Lord . works for cleaning the purification .

This is also the biggest responsibility of every citizen , every project .
In the day of coming everybody participates with enthusiasm in this survey that everybody has listened to me .
In this survey, you must try hard without your city, your place, your streets behind.
It is believed that to separate the wet , dry , dry dry , dry dry dry , use of blue color , green colored dresses in your house all of you have become a good habit .
It is very beneficial to reduce , use again , use of artificial principles .
In this healthy competition related to cleanliness happening between January 4 to March 10,2018 , in this healthy competition related to cleanliness it should also be a public discussion in every city .
Our city, our efforts, our development and progress should be the basis for all of you.

My dear country residents , some things are seen very small but the society has a lot of effect on our identity .
I would like to share this kind of thing with you through Mann Ki Baat.
Who has made such a rules .
Wherefore salvation is done .
It is said that when I went into the depths then when I came to freedom then we were able to say that we were observed .
For decades Muslim women have been wrong but no church has happened .
There is no rule of this rule in many countries .
But Muslim women in India do not have this power.
I am very happy to pay attention to this matter .
Normally, Haj pilgrims are allowed through latter method, but I am supposed to keep alone women away from this latter method.
Our women should also get the right as compared to men . In the progressive way they should also make equal opportunity to walk like men .
My dear country , January 26 January is a historical festival for us .
But this time in 2018 January 26 January is remembered specially .
This time, a total of ten ASEAN (ASEAN) member countries are coming to India as the main guests of the Republic Day.
This time not only one of the ten guests of Ganesha day .
Such India has never happened before in history .
For India , Asian countries 2017 is very important .
If Asian countries finish 50 years in 2017, India has completed its partnership with Asian countries in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all our Indians to be one of the greatest leaders of these ten Asian countries in one place on 26 January.
I want to bring happiness , joy , prosperity , prosperity to all of you in the new year of coming .
We all moved ahead with new enthusiasm , new hope , new culture .
The sun enters Uttaranchal in January and in this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated .
This is a festival drowned with nature .
Every festival is bound with nature, but in different cultures, the nature of Taluku is an ideal to celebrate this wonderful event in different ways, Punjab or North India, if this festival is enjoyed in the form of Loh D.
In Rajasthan, Sankrant says, Magha Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu and all these festivals are special.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th honey to 17th honey .

Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
In our country there is no pride , no pride , no pride , how big are all of us in the age .
Several miles of the history of the country , various types of times are witnesses .
It is said that we are unsuccessful that she is unsuccessfully unsuccessful .
This September was filled ninety years on 28 September .
Before going to foreign journey I got the opportunity to talk with this .
A younger brother walked as if he talked with his dog .
I do not talk about such personal conversations but I want to listen to the words of Ladakh , our conversation .
Modi . Ladakh , Namaskar .
I am talking to Narendra Modi .
Laddakh . Namaskar .
I am surprised to know that before going to America I have photographed you .
When do you return
Modern . 28th honey crossing the midnight 29th day in the morning whereas your birth will be done on the day of your birth .
Oh , that is .
There is nothing to celebrate on the day of birth .
If you get your blessings .
Modi . Ah , you are bigger than me therefore we want your blessings .
I am happy when you say pride that your mother is Gujarati .
This self-confidence gives me happiness like a family .
I do not want to make you more trouble because how much work you are bizarre , how much work I am wandering .
How much we have to think .
But I definitely come in haste .
Modi . come to your house , eat some Gujarati meals done with your hands .
The festivals of the country are light for some weeks .
All of us also celebrate many festivals like Navratri festivals , Garba , Durga Puja , Dussehra , Deepavali , Bhagini handicraft , Chhat Puja .
An inspiration.
If sweets are spoiled in some houses , in some houses children are put for sweets .
Definitely take the habit of participating things in our houses , if we do not need anything then many cities .
They find out the needs of clothes , sweets , food etc . from people , they reach all these things .
In our culture the players are considered as Lakshmi because the child brings prosperity and prosperity.
This time we have organised the program of honoring children in our society , villages , cities .
Does the cost of such a public work .
With their difficulty , taking the name of family , society , society , country children stay between us .
Our society should recognize such children , pride , pride .
This pride program should be celebrated in the country .
We can also do another work - Sher in social media about the achievements of these children, use the hashtag, write Bharatkilaxmi.
A few days ago I got a very interesting answer from the student of Alina Tang of Arunachal Pradesh .
I am coming from Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my test results came then somebody asked me , read the book of exam Warriors .
After that I was very good .
If you read this book before tests then it is more beneficial .
If this book is aimed at printing again then it is in the north that in the new adventure parents, teachers should also be mixed with some other things etc.
See , if the main service of the country is delivered , then it is also believed to my young friends .
Blessed is the student of my little student , first blessed is I for coming to the north .
Along with this my smaller Netarhat also gave me work .
But I want to all of you .
Can you help me
Do you feel any feelings in daily life
Definitely I read them , think , I try to write in my words , in my way .
I wait for your thoughts .
I express my gratitude to the smallest neighbour of Arunachal , Alina Taung.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister of the country will continue to tell you about the extensive programs of T . . through the medium of TV.
If you do not listen to Daniel Medicine , especially the youth have to see that video .
The thought of our ancestors is really good .
Mani Kanchenjunction is the joy of the world , that is , if any person enters yoga , hearing once , then he can enjoy anybody 's mind .
Actually , this young game has spent the mind of all the people of the world .
My beloved countrymen , especially my young friends , I am now talking to you .
Nicotine present in tobacco gives intoxication .
In small age this habit of habit is slaughtered but its effect also affects the brain .
But I want to talk about another new thing with you .
You will have to know that in the middle of India the prohibition has been done on these cigarettes .
This cigarette staying different from usual cigarette is a kind of electronic disorder .
A kind of chemical smoke is produced by hoting a liquid substance with nicotine in this cigarette so that nicotine is consumed.
Like the rest of the cigarettes in which aroma chemicals are also included in it not spreading odour .
We keep looking at , even in one house the father 's smoker keeps on stopping the remaining people of the house without burning cigarettes , cigarettes , beedi etc .
Other members of the family are not seen that this smoking is not able to smoke .
They know that due to smoking , tobacco there is heavy damage to the body .
In fact, many harmful chemicals are added to this cigarette which have a very bad effect on health.
You know , if someone smokes then we know that by the smell coming they are burning cigarettes .
If there is no cigarette in their pocket then the smell of smell is known .
But it is not like e-cigarettes that some children , youth , knowing , fashioning fashion are very proudly seen roaming in offices , in their pockets , sometimes in their hands .
Youth meaning the future of our country .
I want all of you to leave the intoxication of tobacco , do not recognize the problems about this cigarette .
Fit India i . . in the evening two o'clock in the day , not playing hands and feet .
To stay away from the above scabies i . . fit India .
Our India has become the birthplace of an extraordinary person like Ratna.
They also lived for others besides themselves .
Such a great person will be honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of great pride that all Indians are proclaiming the pride of treasure on 13th October of Pope Francis.
Sister Trasia is an example of the world for humanity , good works done for humans in the lifetime of fifty years .
There is a marvellous interest in social service , education .
Once again, I pay homage to Sister and Treasure, I offer my best wishes to the people of India, especially to our Christian brothers and sisters.

Mann Ki Baat November 2017
O people of my beloved country , Namaskar .
Some time ago, I got the opportunity to interact directly with the child friends of Karnataka.
These answers were good for me .
These children have proposed a lot of things and advised us to bring about changes in the training system by providing Kirti Hegde, Digital India, Smart City systems in Northern Karnataka.
If we give information about nature to our children , perhaps in the first time there is a chance of their use to save the environment .
It is said that the girl of Rida Nadaf from Lakshmieshwar is proud to be the daughter of a soldier .
Our soldiers are not Indians prideing to take our soldiers .
It is common for you to pride as a soldier 's daughter .
Irfan Begum from Kalburji is that his school is at a distance of five kilometres from his village , therefore the school has to come out very soon , to return home also late at night .
But the people of the country , I enjoyed the opportunity of reading all these northern tips .
I have a good experience .
O people of my beloved country , this is November 26 .
This is the day of our state .
In 1949 on this day the parlor of India parlor of India was adopted .
Because of the coming to the state of January 1950 , January 26 January we celebrated that day .
The state of India is the spirit of our democracy .
This is the day to remember the members of our state council .
They have industrialized about three-three to make our state of India .
How to read that church of those people who have given life to the country is pride .
How hard industry can they imagine to make the state of our country full of many poisons .
Whether they are able to imagine how much knowledge , awakening , far-sightedness at the time of getting rid of the slavery of the country .
In the matter of this state the responsibility of making a new India according to the thoughts of the state , according to their thoughts .
Our state is very expansive .
Besides the preservation of beads , teams , bendings , backwards , tribals , women , every citizen , besides the preservation of their preservation our state .
It is our duty to participate our state .
It is common to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar .
Fifteen committees have been built on the main things of this state .
Among these the most important is Mussoorie Committee .
Babasaheb , and Ambedakar , and that old age .
They played a major role .
We are proud to see the kingdom of India , Dr.
Every class of the society they made the state .
On the sixth day of December we reminded them as soon as we reminded them .
December 15 Sirdar Vallabhbhai Patel is the vertebrae of the dynasty .
Ratu children have shown an extraordinary reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive organs of the country .
Sardar Patel is also a member of the state .
They are also a study of the consultations made on the first hiccups , mannaritis , number of ultrasounds , other tribals .
On that day these people lost their lives , protective houses , Bhadrata Sibbadi reminds all the country .
Their sacrifice never forgets the country .
The rapidity of rapidity has played a terrible form because of the accidents happening in every place of the world .
Because of acuteness we have to face many problems in the country in the last forty years .
Thousands of innocents lost their lives .
In order to destroy human power acute waist has been built .
Apart from this not only India but all the human powers of the world should be shipped by standing together .
Lord Buddha , Mahavir , Guru Nanak , Mahatma Gandhi etc . gave the messages of lovers , lovers of the world .
Acuteness , wrath makes our social system weak , try to make it small .
Therefore it is the time to stay best for all the human powers .
My dear countrymen , on the 4th day of December all of us celebrate the day of Navika .
Sindhu river , Ganga , Yamuna , Saraswati rivers are in the banks of our civilization .
Yavat is the entry of the world between us .
This country , this land has an unforgettable bond with great seas .
Seeing in history eight , nine hundred years ago , whereas in all the teams of Navika teams have recognized the most powerful Navika team .
In the expansion of the empire of the empire , in the contemporary states of the contemporary states Kella Agricultural power has played a big role .
The examples of adventurous journeys of the Navika teams of the places are available in Sangam literature .
Many people of the world know that after many soldiers of the world , many years women were permission on the boats of war .
But eight , nine hundred years old women played the main role of women in large numbers .
Women also participate in war .
The scientific science related to the construction of boating of the local rulers was rich .
Situated at the main role of the sea Konkan shore was part of the state of Maharaj Shivaji .
Several forts like Sindhu forts , Murud anjira , Golden Fort etc . were surrounded by sea shores or sea .
The responsibility of all these forts was done by the boating of Marathas .
Large boats and small boats were connected in the boating team of Marathas.
Their Navika team was very skilled to escape from any enemy , to escape from them .
While talking about the teeth of Marathas , Kanhoji can not be remembered .
He went to a high level of the Marathi boats and at many places he built the establishments of Marathi boats.
In India-Pakistan war in 1971, our navy had seen its tradition in many cases after independence.
Everybody saved the fishermen from the water and handed them to Bangladesh.
This year, in the months of May, 1996, three ships of our Navy reached there at the moment when there were terrible floods in Sri Lanka, the government provided their help to the people.
In the month of September, in Bangladesh, we have a boat I.N.
If you have to give health services to Fezi then symptoms have to be given relief , even during the risk of neighbouring country our Navika team has always been doing glorious work .
125 crore people of the country are dedicated to the country, our soldiers dedicate their youth, their lives for the country.
Every year on 7th December, the soldiers of war celebrate Flag Day.
This is the day of proclaiming all the pride of the soldiers of our country .
There should be a glorious garden of army in the country .
In school , art galleries , art galleries can be asked information related to the army from them .
To know the information related to the army this is a good opportunity for our youth .
This is an opportunity to gather all the soldiers of our soldiers for the protection of the soldiers .
The support of the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war by this whole army conservation board , their archaeological expense is done .
In this conclusion we also work to increase the psychological strength of our soldiers .
We also do good work for them .
My dear countrymen, the fifth day of December is World Soil Day.
This conclusion I want to tell some words with my brother , sisters .
The most important part of the soil is soil .
The substance that we eat is contained with this soil .
The whole food chain is drowned with soil in a way.
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life .
How to live animals .
This is the reason that we have been the best for the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, some scientific methods of nutrition have become part of our lives.
To save our soil , to save the soil of scientific soil , to save the soil both are important in the lives of this country .
It is a matter of pride that in our country the rails are tied with tradition , to show interest towards modern science , to make efforts , to make efforts .
I have heard about the rails from Tohu village and Bhoraj Black in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is said that some rails of the village have discovered the situation of poisoning with the best condition , after examining their soil at the time of testing their soil , which kind of red nutrition , nutritious redness , central redness .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
Along with this the soil has also glittered in the soil .
If you want to think about the fruit then before preserving the earth carefully .
All our rails across the country understand their soil even more properly , according to which the soil health cards have been taken over ten crore .
We worship the mother of the earth but how much the health of the earth is spoiled by flying .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the reason of more redness than required .
Global warming , changes in the environment , we all feel .
Sometimes the winters were coming before Deepavali . Now the winters coming to December are slowly stepping .
But as soon as winters start, we don't want to come out of the rage, it is an experience for all of us.
On going to 30,40 houses everyday because of this child who tells about cleanliness this child has got relief from the excretion of Bahraang village .
In the direction of producing cleanliness this small child has done how inspirational work .
There is no support from the age of sanctuary , there is no limit .
Children , elders , women , men are important for everyone .
Everybody needs to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divang brother , Sodrimans were strong .
Can adventurous , adventurous .
You can learn something from them every moment .
These are queens in every hole .
In playing , in some social problems our Divang brothers do not take anyone .
You will remember that our Divyang players in Rio Olympics have won four stars by exhibiting well-known sports.
Blind T20 stands as a champion in the world cup.
Different types of competitions keep happening in the country .
A few days ago, 17th National Para swimming competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divang brothers , sisters , daughters who came from different places of the country participated in that competition and showed their talent .
A Divya youth participating in it is 19 years of Gujarat . He does not have fifty percent of his body .
But see adventurous , satisfaction , satisfaction .
He will be trained in the Centre for Excellence, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, where he is selected in 32 Para swimming.
Everybody should walk ahead together .
After some days this festival is celebrated .
On this day Paragbar Hazrat Mohammad Saheb .
I am telling the heartbeat of all the people of the country .
I hope that in order to increase peace and harmony in this Eid society, it gives us a new enthusiasm, gives new energy, ability to make new contributions.
2017 was completed . 2018 door .
But you have a good information .
I have thought to change your words even more .
Don't forget sorrow, don't forget happiness, we will forget the sorrows of the villagers living in our villages and the elders.
In our country also an attempt is made to remind the interesting incidents of the last year in the media .
Give inspiration to others .
If you want to divide good things , then mind will be able to do good work .
Good things give strength to do good things .
The power of this peace place , its effect was seen all of us together .
In the coming mind, I will definitely try to give the people of the country the things that have come in this positive way.
My dear countrymen , coming month , coming in the mind of Rabo , I come between you .
On the second time there is a chance of telling many pockets .
Man Ki Bath : Talking in mind .
This festival is completely celebrated with nature , nature worshipping this festival .
During this worship of sunni , water , water . utensils , soil utensils , bamboo etc . are different items covered with these worshipping methods .
The sunrise , sunset , sunset in this festival full of faith is full of a special culture .
If the world is worshipping them , then it is important to worship this chat puja as well .
How important is this festival in laughter in our life .
Before this festival people also clean the coasts of the river , river , ponds , worshipping rivers with very enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider everybody 's pride towards this great tradition of India .
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that a hundred percent of the people of the country have become strong bonds.
Take the example of Khadi , doing .
During Gandhi Jayanti the result of taking Khadi , done on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti is that how happy you are also .
On the fifteenth October i. e.
Khadi , doing , both girls are such a big height that you also have a joyous thing .
During Deepavali approximately 680 percent increase in the girls of Khadi Gift Cooper .
In all the girls of Khadi , handicrafts also this year approximately ninety percent increase has been registered .
In the middle of this age , elders , children , elders , women , all the adults also like Khadi .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit to the families of many families working directly , how many poor families .
I thought that now, Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, all the places have been transformed for Khadi.
Besides bringing changes in the lives of poor carbons , Khadi , both of them change in the power to bring them up with breathing power .
How to give the sweets of our house to the teams of Bhadrata in the Nrandra Modi Yap
It is said that during the festival we also remember our soldiers .
I also felt that if our house sweets were given to the teams of Bhadrata .
On the other hand we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepavali festival with our Veer Bhadrata teams running in the borders .
This time, I feel unforgettable to celebrate Deepawali with the Bhadratas of Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
How difficult , poisonous situations in the borders of the country they keep protecting the country , the conservation of that conservation , dedication , dedication of dedication , dedication of all the people of the country .
When we get the opportunity, when we get the opportunity, we need to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their glorious stories.
It is said that not only the soldiers of our Bhadrata teams are playing an important role in the borders but also in the whole world .
As peacekeepers in the UN Peacekeeper United Kingdom, they are reviving the name of India all over the world.
A few days ago, on October 24, the UN Day, i. e.
Efforts to establish peace in the world , their successful role is remembered everybody .
We believe that the family of Vasudika family is our family i . . the whole world is our family .
With this belief the first Indian Equality Committee of India has been making active participation in various important attempts .
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India, the proposal of the United States Committee of Charter, both of them start with the word 'we the People'.
India has always empowered the equality of women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is an example of this.
It feels very small changes but a strong thought is seen in it .
India has played the most important role in the peaceful conservation work of the UN Umbrella.
India has always played a big role in the peacekeeping Mission of the United Kingdom.
This is the first time that more than 18 thousand Indian Bhadrata teams have provided their services in UN Peacekeeping operations.
Our soldiers have served in nearly 50 operations in the 71 peacekeeping operations conducted by the UK as part of August 2017.
These operations were carried out in many countries of the world such as Corea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyrus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In the hospital organised by Indian Army in Congo, South Sudan, more than twenty thousand patients were treated and how many others were rescued.
India's Bhadrata teams not only saved the people there in many countries, but also celebrated many hearts there.
Indian women have played an important role in the peaceful establishment program .
After that, all the rest of the countries also started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not just a result of peacekeeping workers, but also offering training to the peacekeepers of about fifty countries.
Our peacekeepers from this land walking by Mahatma Gandhi , Gautam Buddha gave the messages of peace and harmony to the world .
Peace conservation work is not so easy .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata have to work in dangerous areas also .
Various kinds of people have to be in the middle of humans .
Different conditions , various traditions have to be detected .
They have to forget themselves according to the local needs of those places , conditions .
The second Indian Peacekeeper Laftenant Journal Love Chand, who brought a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, at the age of 72, he gave his services to ensuring the freedom of that country by getting Forts Commander for Namibia operations.
Journal Thimaiah, chief of the Indian Army, also led the peacekeeping team of the United States in Cyprus and dedicated everything to peacekeeping.
In the form of peacefulness, India has always been providing the message of world peace, unity and harmony.
It is my belief that everybody lives with peaceful feelings, a well-known peaceful future is moving ahead in the direction.
My dear countrymen , our pilgrimage land is full of the great feelings of human service .
We are also one of such extraordinary people who call our brother distressed .
Swami Vivekananda was born by the name of Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland.
It is understood that it is to be dedicated completely .
Later the name was done by that name .
Thou hast a hundred and fifty Jayanti .
How much influenced by Swami Vivekananda , dedicated his comfortable life , dedicated to the service of lice .
She knows very well what is happening in the British state .
Besides making our country slaves the English attempts to make us mentally also slaves .
By showing our culture less , it is an attempt to produce unconsciousness in us .
Brothers and sisters established the pride of Indian culture .
The national spirit was working to make people one by awakening .
Going to various countries of the world , opposite to the illusions happening about the religion , elements of the world .
Famous nationalist, Tamil poet Subrahman Bharati has renowned his revolutionary poem 'Pudumi Pon', the newly born woman and women empowerment.
It is called inspiration brother .

Our Indian beauty is in our culture to fulfil the spirituality and sciences of each other.
Scientists , scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose is its exhibition .

Without thinking about his health the brother started the work of cleaning the roads , roads .

Children are officers , heroes for the construction of Navbharat .
Your movement is right and the diseases that have come in the end of the life of old age are now seen in children too.
It is very surprising to hear that children also have diabetes .
This is also such diseases that in the past such diseases were only coming to the livers of rich , luxury life .
Such diseases were rare in youth .
But this has changed our lifestyle .
Such diseases are known by the name of lifestyle .
Change in our food habits , not sufficient physical labor in life people are the main causes of occurrence of such diseases in the age of pinnacle .
It is important to pay attention to society , family planning .
If it is thinking then it is not enough to take more precautions like this .
Small tasks have to be done regularly , changing their habits , changing their habits in the right way .
The family members should try to make their children a habit of playing in the fields with the best .
If possible elders should also try to play with children in the field .
Do the habit of roaming down the stairs on the way without using Lift .
After dinner try to walk everybody , children in the family .
It is easy because somebody can learn easily because yoga can be done anywhere .
There is no need of any special equipment , fields .
How much research is used to control diabetes .
All Ayurveda , yogani we should not see only the meditation of disease .
We should participate in our life .
My beloved country , especially my youths , in the last few days good news came in playing .
In different games our country has been named the country .

I also got the opportunity to see a game.
I tell the players once again , their friends , players , sports , sports .
My dear countrymen, how many people are coming to me in the matter of Swachh Bharat, if I want to judge all those opinions then I have to make a programme in the mind every day only for the mind.
If one small children try to send photographs , then there are stories of attempts of young hair at another place .
If there is any creative incision related to cleanliness at one place , then there is a news about changes coming from some authority .
A few days ago there was a broad report in which there is a story of the revival of Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra .
There, an NGO Vrindavan Chandrapur Fort, an Ecological Protection Organization, has undertaken a cleanliness programme.
In this program running for two hundred days people were running the program without stopping , without getting tired , standing in a hair .
Regularly two hundred days .
Before the program , after that photographs were sent to me .
This Bhagirathi attempt done for cleanliness is a marvellous example of beauty , community , constant example .
Forts are our heritage symbols .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is all the people of the country .
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur, all of them, to thee, to the Ecological Protection Organization.
O people of my beloved country , on the fourth day of November we all celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Apart from the first Guru Nanak Sikhs , Jagat Guru is also the first Guru .
They have seen all the species of humans together .
Women have given the importance of empowerment , women pride .
During his visit to Guru Nanak, he gave a message of real humanity.
They have seen the way of truth , sacrifice , action .
It is said that in the society not only through words but also through his works they have seen the messages about equality in the society.
Guru Nanak had also done Guruvani to tell his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th light of Guru Nanak .
Come , we try to move ahead on the path of their messages .
After two days of my beloved country , we are celebrating the Jayanti of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31 October .
We all know that the foundation of modern Akhand India has been laid .
How much can we learn from the extraordinary journey of the great child of India .
On 31 October 31 October Indira Gandhi had left this preaching .
He is the same time in fulfilling the thought .
The serpentine of India standing on all the sides of India has been impossible .
Crores of Indians have ensured the efforts to bring India under one country, one state.
Their decision has given them the power to face all the obstacles .
Where psychological needs worked with psychological power .
Where strong use is necessary it is done .
They were moving ahead with complete curiosity towards one goal .
This program of one country can be done each other .
Everybody has imagined the country like equality .
I want all of us to be inspired by these words - the difference between Kullu and Kullu should not stop us.
This story of Sardar is also inspirational , related to our dream of New India .
Because of this reason their Jayanti is celebrated on the occasion of the country .
His support is unparalleled in giving a form of a unparalleled form to the country .
After my dear countrymen , Deepavali Shells , with new culture , you will start again in your daily life .
All the people of my country want to fulfil their dreams , luxury .
Through the sky you all have spent three times while talking to your mind .
This is the 36th part of the word in the mind .
I have never said these things in my mind .
In this mind I told the words that I had sent me from all the four corners of the country .
Many of them give me inspiration .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some people have to pay attention to some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your summit for half an hour, but people keep reaching their words for thirty-five days in the month.
Therefore the journey of talking in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
I am giving thanks to all the people of the country to understand the feelings of common people of India in such a short time .
Now three-three are completed therefore social scientists , university , researchers , media specialists , media specialists .
But in future such poisonous churches how much uses in the mind . a sufficient spirit , new enthusiasm .
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths used to do such work before .
How many people who want to use the food left in Kanchenjun , how many people came in my sight , how much joy was enjoyed .
Once again, I had seen the photograph of Selfie with Dr. in a serpent in Haryana and told everyone in my heart about it.
On seeing that not only in India, Yavat started a big garden called Self-with-doter in the world.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self confidence in every girls .
Everybody has to take self-confidence with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has its own importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the tourism department of the Government of India .
I would like to send photographs to those who are going on a journey to Incredibly India.
Then lakhs of pictures coming from different places of India have also been very big contribution for all those working in the tourism sector .
I felt by talking to the mind that a small incident can be lifted up so big garden .
On coming to the thought of three times many incidents of my mind were solidified .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of the society , for the progress of the country .
This is a part of my three-three Mann Ki Baat. It is known and learned from the people of the country.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power .
I salute the heart of all the people of the country .
Once I talked about Khadi in my mind . Khadi is not a cloth but a thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about October 2, which is very low.
I want to increase this Khadi procedure in such a way that I want to increase .
The zeal of Khadi has also increased in the field of Khadi, in the field of Khadi, in the Government of India, in a new corners.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the productivity , how to bring the handmades working with solar energy , how to revive the ancient traditions closed from 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years of age etc.
Many people were produced .
He reiterated the training centre of Khadi and Rural Industries covered in Pampore, Kashmir, which has a lot of work in Kashmir to provide for this field.
I am very happy to see the new generations in creating, swimming, new things in the beginning of the training centre and to enhance the number of big corporate institutions in Deepawali.
People also began to choose Khadi things while giving each other .
How to move ahead some things naturally came into our experience .
O my dear countrymen, in the mind of the month of Christianity, we have decided to celebrate the Swachhta Festival from 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Our pride President George started this program .
Children , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of houses .
It is said that I can contact with Sanctuary , how we are moving ahead in this way we are seeing before the eyes .
Everybody adopts this proposal , gives support to its support , successfully .
That is why the President President told thanks to the President .
Along with them, every section of the country is also considered to be its own work and everybody has been associated with this propaganda.
They , scientists , schools , art galleries , university , rails , officers , police , children , youths , children .
If these places are bad then people are not able to swallow up, they are also able to see this tension in those working there.
It is very good that in the last four days, more than fifty lakh people and more than forty thousand people have participated in this programme.
Some people are working continuously with the goal of showing results .
This time we have also seen new things - taking a bed program , taking precautions without crossing the other side .
If you want to change cleanliness in a nature , then the emotional garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by the service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have made pictures .
The pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
When the word came then I forgot to tell them blessedness of the media .
We are seeing how much of the services of electronic media, print media, the country are doing in the sanctuary.
Somebody told me about the youth of the eighteenth year of Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
You will be happy to know that this Bill Dar has been appointed as your Brand Ambassador for the functioning of the Srinagar Puranakar incident, whether it is a brand Ambassador or a hero in the field of sports.
Not only this .
Bilal Dar has taken care of his twelve - twelve years of age , last five years of cleanliness .

I am offering many congratulations to Bilal Dar .
We should confess that my beloved country , future history , past history .
This time Nanjijijijijijijijiji , Pondicherry is also the year of the century .
What is the center of all these great men
One common thing in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
It is natural to have the pride of their village programme while celebrating their centenary celebrations, leaving the royal life of Nanaji's country and leaving the royal life of the village.
The President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam, spoke to the youngsters every time, Nanaji was talking about the rural development of the country.
Like Mahatma Gandhi , Din Dayal teacher also used to talk about the person sitting in the last room of the society .
We should also run for unity , move forward the mantra of unity .
Our unity in diversity is usually telling us the speciality of India .
We respect the diversity but sometimes you try to feel this diversity .
Deepavali falls near Deepavali . There is so much in the thought of going somewhere in the country .
Everybody is a common thing to go to tourists .
But it is a matter of concern that people don't see our country, don't see the varieties of the country.
Our country is full of many species .
All these great feelings have also been tourist in the country .
Before starting this work , an attempt has been made to understand the country .
India is trying to live in itself .
My own experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
I got the opportunity to spend the night in more than four hundred districts .
I would like to feel yourself, not only individuality in diversity, but also in this large country of India, our immense strength.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power situated in our country tourism .
I have heard that , if you want to go out in your holidays , changes should be understood , understand what should be understood , learn from the goal of learning .
Visit India inside you .
Your life is prosperous by these experiences .
Your thought will be large .
There are cost of experiences .
Normally from October to March is good for tourism .
Definitely send your photograph in uncertainty (Hash Tag Incredible) .
You should also send pictures of humans connected to the place where you go .
Besides the idols of construction , not only the beauty of nature but also write about the lifestyles there .
Can you put in uncertainty
You see, I would like to tell the government that after discovering the information from one state, we have to make a publicity about the seven places that have come out of them.
The Government of India definitely works on them .
In such excellent places the government accepts the information of pictures , making video , propagating them , encouragement from you , how many acquaintances .
Come on, walk with me.
You can also become a big motivation to use the time from October to March for the month of March , to encourage the country tourism .
I'm calling you.
My dear countrymen , many things of a man wash me .
My mind becomes the victim of obstruction .
I leave deep effect on my mind .

Why are the unusual people saying that their husbands do not become heavens while serving the mother of India.
If the age of small age becomes chest then how can we imagine their condition .
She trained with hard industry for eleven months , to fulfill her husband 's dreams .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dubey had forgotten the death of working in the army of Mukhesh Dubey .
His wife reached the army as well .
It is natural to have the pride of this maternal power of every Indian , our pride towards these virgins .
I am telling many acquaintances with the heart of these two brothers .
They gave new inspiration, new excitement to millions of people of the country.
These two brothers have many impressions .
My dear countrymen , Navratri festivals , Deepavali festivals have given a big opportunity to the youth of our country .
FIFA under-17 World Cup happens in our country.

Every generation the interest of football increases .
In any school , art gallery , football playing in India there is no grade without youth .
My beloved country , Navratri festival is held .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The whole environment is pure , aromatic .
There is an atmosphere filled with spiritual environment , festival environment , devotion .
All this is considered to be the festival of energy .
These are also called Sharad Navratri .
O my beloved countrymen , Sadar Namaskar .
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand, it is natural to worry about the country whenever there are positive news from any corner of India.
This is the birthplace of Sardar Patel for the country of Buddha , the birthplace of Gandhi .
Ahimsa Paramo Dharamshala . It has been said that we have come to hear it from a small time .
I also said from the Red Fort that the name of beliefs has not been tolerated by the name of beliefs, whether it is traditional beliefs or beliefs or beliefs of royal thoughts or beliefs or beliefs of a person or beliefs or beliefs or beliefs or beliefs.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements to get justice .
I believe that the people of the country don't tolerate any government that takes the legislation in the hands of those who take the legislation on the path of hyssan.
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we got the tradition of cultural traditions , social traditions , historical incidents , everything , because in the year there is no day with any festival .
All our festivals also come according to the time of nature .
Everything is directly related to nature .
The society of Jain society is celebrated throughout the year .
The Jain society is celebrated in the month of Bhadrapa .
The festival of Purushu is held on the last day of the year .
Actually this is a wonderful tradition .
The festival of the year is a symbol of forgiveness , non-vegetarian feelings .
My dear countrymen , nowadays everybody of the country is celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi festival .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .
Bal Gangadhar Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago, which was a symbol of independence before the last 125 years of independence.
After independence they were symbol of awakening social education , social awareness .
Ganesh Chaturthi festival is done for ten days .
This festival is said to be the symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The contribution of the Ganesh Festival of all the people of the country is many luxuries .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
Onam of Kerala is a major festival in the colorful festivals of India .
This festival tells social , cultural importance .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
This festival creates a new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and capability in the society.
Now our festivals are also changing their attractions .
Durga Puja Festivals at Navratri Festivals in Gujarat have become their attractions.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
In that direction we should think what we can do .
In the tradition of these festivals in some days Id-ul-Juha festival has come .
Congratulations and good wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festival meaning belief , belief symbol .
Festivals in Navbharata should be made a symbol of cleanliness .
It is not new to us but it is important to change it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village , in the city , in the city , in the state , in our country , in our country , cleanliness is a major part of the festivals .
My beloved country , modern meanings are changing .
These days, how many cultures you have, how many modern your thinking system is new, all these have become a new corners, a new measure, a balance.
Therefore in all the days of this festival the soil of the environment has started .
If you see in YouTube , then children in every house make the soil of the soil colors of it .
Some colors of vegetables , some colored paper pieces .
The media house is also giving training to the people to make the idols of Ganesh idols at a height of big environment .
See how big changes have come .
Rejoicing changes.
As I said , our country is full of marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
If someone does new inventions then it will be very happy .
Somebody told me that he has given me some special kinds of soil , mixing it , training to make soil .
After worship , if the idol is drowned in a small bucket , the idol melts immediately in water .
I have started the Swachhata Garden, which will be completed on 2nd October.
The results of this garden are seen .
Constructions of the houses have reached about 39 to 67.
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang urine they were free from excretion .
In the middle of Gujarat, there were terrible floods.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of flood a lot of odour spread .
During this period, two and a half halls and three mosques were cleaned in Dhanera, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers in Banaskanta district of Gujarat.
Everybody saved their sweating .
If an attempt is made to dedicate with the feeling of dedication then our country can fly at a height of more than another .
In one way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja it has been considered as a symbol of worshipping .
Go to the nearby cities , go to the nearby village but consider all this as a garden .

The number of people listening is in crores but lakhs of people are coming to Uttaranchal , sending messages through phones , all this is like a big anger to me .
I have become a big opportunity to know the words of all the people of the country .
The more you wait for the words in your mind , the more I wait for your messages .
They come to work for the work of doing .
Once some things are mixed in our habits so much that we are fulfiling .
"President Garu, I'm talking to abusive from Puna.
I want to tell about my friends.
Whenever she tries to help the people , but a habit of her own habit has been distressing me .
I went to a shopping mall once with myself.
On one scratch he spent two thousand rupees easily .
The pizza has kept 450 rupees but the shopping mall has been done for five rupees with the auto driver .
On the way the vegetables were bought . Beramadi 4,5 rupees on each vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if you go to shopping in Shorm then you will not be able to sell it but if someone comes to work with the poor then there is no unconsciousness .
Do you think that what is the cost of the poor
In your life there is no importance of two rupees , five rupees but your small habits can be wounded so deeply .
Thank you, Madam, for telling me through your phone calls about such a heart attack.
I believe that my countrymen also have the habit of producing such a habit with their poor people , they definitely change .
My beloved youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national sports .
This is the birthplace of great hockey game , Haki Mantra Major Dhan Chand .
The service of Haki sports is unparalleled .
The reason for remembering this thing is that my desire to drown with the sports of our country .
Sports should be part of our life .
When the youth of the world is our country then it should also be seen in the sports of that youth .
One type of sports is a big medicine used to meet mind .
I would like to warn the youth of our country that the playing field is very important in the computer age.
Play FIFA in computer but also show out in the field at times with football .
Crickets keep playing in computer but cricket playing under the sky in the open field is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when they ask .
Now the situation is that there are children in the house also drowned in seeing phones , cartoon films or mobile games .

In rainy season the mind of man is very important .
Animals , birds , wolves , nature , everybody changes due to rainy season .
The changing weather cycle has brought about changes in the environment and its impact is also very fast.
In the last few days, natural calamities have been faced in some areas of Assam, North-Eastern regions of India, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal.
My friends of the Mantravarg also reach the place wherever possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the problems of flood in their own ways .
In such situations the help of people social institutions , cultural institutions , services are helping them with their hands .

When I am ready for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I am asking the people of the country to become more than me.
I was very impressed to hear your chartered accountants day.
Last month, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented in our country on the same day.
That is why you can say whether the results of the government have come in the last months or not .
In this matter I want to know your thoughts .
I am glad to know that because of GST, how they are getting cheaper and how things are getting cheaper, when I get answers from some lice.
Especially the trade of yoga is increasing .
I am passing through the impact of GST in transport and logistics.
How fast the direct change , fast magnificence registration has created a new belief in the country .
The economists and technologists of the economic system must study the use of GST in India and stand before the world as a specimen.
This is a case of all the universities of the world .
Because with such a big height , such a great change , with the help of so many crore people in this large country it is a very big task to run ahead successfully .
Definitely research on this thing .
All the decisions have been taken concentrated by mixing state , central governments .
The result of that concentration is that there is no weight of any kind in the lice .
What was the price before GST, in the new situations, you will be able to know that all the things are in the GST app.
It has played a crucial role in enhancing the belief between the government and the businessmen.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries participating in this programme, all the departments, central and state governments.
GST is an important example of the overall energy of India.
If you want to say in a way , this is a social collection park .
To make such a big attempts easy I am making the fort of all the crores of the country .
My dear country residents , August meaning Victoria month .
It is natural that on August 1, 1920, we have been listening to it.
On August 9, 1942, the uit India Park was launched and also called August Revolution.
On 15 August 1947 independence came to the country .
In a way , all the incidents occurring in the month of August are also mainly drowned with the history of independence .
What happened in August 9th honey in 1942 they should know our new generation .
From 1857 to 1942 the people of the country have drowned with the spirit of independence , which is the inspiration for the construction of India .
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives into the flow of gardens with the mantra of "Doo RD".
Lakhs of youth stopped their studies , left books .
The great men like Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan played a big role in the garden.
In 1920, the uit India Garden, in 1942, both of them demonstrate two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the rapidity of the garden has increased as a result of the helplessness of the garden, the great man like Mahatma Gandhi also gave the mantra of 'Doo RD' and the people's relevance behind it.
Once the history of India roams, I think that the first freedom struggle of India began in 1857.
Then the initial freedom struggle of 1942 was going on some or the other corner of the country .
This long time has created an inspiration in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody has become responsible for the decision of doing something or the other .
This industry, which had come from 1857 to 1942, reached the last stage of 1942.
The ueen India Park has turned so much that the English had to leave the country in 1947 .
1857 AD this independence of 1942 reached all the people of this independence .
Besides this in 1942 all the people were decided with one mind , with one mind , successfully to give independence to the country .
These five are like a turn .
Now I will connect you with a past .
In 1947 we got freedom .
Now 2017.
Approximately fifty years have passed .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , marai , increase .
Everybody tried to get out of the country in their own ways .
As soon as I saw that from 2017 to 2022 the five times were also included in the contribution of five times .
Try to complete them .
As in 1942 to 1947, five miles of the countrys independence
These five , i . . 2017 to 2022 should also be done for the future of India .
After five years the independence of the country is celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make a strong contribution .
2017 should be done in our contribution year .
Every Indian, social institutions, local institutions, regional departments, schools, art galleries, different institutions, everybody is committed to New India.
Come , we are part of this Sanctuary .
I would like to urge my young friends and my young friends to come forward to collaborate with the creative methods of building a New India, especially from the online world.
Use technologies bring video , posts , blankets , new thoughts .
We refreshed this proposal as a January .
In the Narendra Modi App, we are also dedicating the uit India quiz for young friends.
This quiz is useful in introducing the youth of our country with the history of our country , freedom fighters .
I believe that you will definitely spread all directions by making a detailed publicity for this effort.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, there is an opportunity to talk to the people of the country from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
From the Red Fort the tongue of hundreds of crores of people resonates .
It is an attempt to give the shape of words to the dreams of those dreams that in the last three years, on 15th August, I have been giving information and advice about what things I should talk about.
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
In the last three three August 15 January I heard that my delivery is taking a long time .
Therefore I decided that this time I would reduce my delivery time .
O my dear country , I proposed another thing .
In the economy of India there is a social economy .
We should never reduce it .
Our festivals , our festivals are not just enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social collections .
But along with this our every festival remains straight with the economic life of Pauri .
In some days Raksha Bandhan , Janmashtami , Vinayak Chawti , after that Chawti Chandra , Ananta Chaturdashi , Durga Puja , Deepawali .
Rakhi starts making rocks in small cottage industries in lakh families of Rakhi a few months before the economy .
Those who make Rakhis , selling Rakhis , making sweets , thousands of people daily trade is drowned with a festival .
The families of our poor brother , brothers and sisters were spent due to this .
Not only the festival of light , but not only the festival of bringing glimpse to the house .
Its relation is linked to the poor families making small soil straight .
But now I want to talk about the economic system of the poor lying on the festivals , while talking about the economic system of the poor lying with those festivals .
Sometimes I feel that the people of my country are very active , active .
In the last months the best people were written to me for environment .
125 years , 125 crore people of the country .
Together with this we say that for environment conservation environment friendly Ganesh i . . soil Ganapati is worshipped .
I am telling many acquaintances for the festivals of different festivals of the country .
Beloved my country , education , economic sector , social area , sports , sports , our girls are continuously giving new goals to the country .
All the people of our country are also proud to see our girls .
Some days Christian women of our country have exhibited marvellous games in the competitions of the world .
In this week I got the opportunity to be Bhenti with those players .
I am very happy to talk to them, but I have seen that they are very heavy to be unable to win the World Cup.
In their mohals also those disappointments , stress were seen .
If the players of India were smitten then we saw many games to break on them with anger .
If you do not spend the match , then you have spent the hearts of 125 crore people .
I have told those sportspersons that in reality our country is young, especially our girls.
On the second time the youth of the country , especially our girls tell my heartfelt impressions , luxury .
2022 , we also remember that 75 springs come to our independence .
Make a sign of five paths for every country 's civilization , for its contribution .
We move ahead with the belief of the country , future is better .
Blessed are all of you .
It is a feeling that how much of our struggles are, however stressful we are, it can be a self-sufficient life or a people's life - it is an excitement to come to each other for years.
Jagannath Rath Yatra is being celebrated in many places of the country with a sacred sense.
This festival is now celebrated in some places of the world .
The guests of the country have discovered deep feelings with Lord Jagannath .
Lord Jagannath is the worship of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Jagannath Bhagwan's Rath Yatra.
The unity in diversity is also one of the specialities of India.
The family of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim Sodars and Sodars lives in that small village.
On this occasion, it is decided that all the rural people will be able to build roads together.
Uttrakhand and Haryana have also reached this jabita this week.
But our habit doesn't change.
This is the case of cleanliness.

When I was the chief minister of Gujarat, I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcome them with handkerchief.

There is no deficiency of any kind of deficiency in our country .
If children liked in our family then give opportunity to water in the field of playing .
By bringing water from the field of sports , binding in the room does not change the books into worms .
Along with reading they should also be put in front of the sports in the field of sports . students should encourage all the places in the school , art gallery , family .
All Indians should move ahead in the direction of new dreams of coming to Olympics .

But I have seen that some try to learn music , some try to learn new things , some try to learn new things with the help of Europe , some try to learn new language .
Some are learning poets , some are learning poets , some are learning poets .
Knowing about nature , trying to understand , understood .
I want to hear you a phone call too.
I am talking to Diksha Katyal.

Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the fighting of freedom, I understood that how many sacrifices have to be given to India, how many freedom fighters have to spend in the waters.
How many acquaintances were influenced by Bhagat Singh in small age .
Therefore, I want you to give a message to the youth about this.
I am very happy to see our youth interested in knowing about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
The number of great men lost their youth in the waters .

If you are also possible , in a way go to this pilgrimage area related to our independence .
People of my country , one Monday in 5 months of June .
If you want to say in another thing then back to basics .
If you want to contact nature , increase the batter plant .
Who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhi said many times, "one must come out about a world one will see".
That is , we should also think about the world , take precaution .
You must have seen , the power of nature is that when one glass of water comes very tired then how freshness comes on the mouth .
On getting very tired , opening the windows of the room , opening the doors , sucking fresh air new awareness comes .
Therefore the attempts of the world should also be given our own attempts to kiss with the nature of June .
Our ancestors are now available to save environment .
It is said that the cause of cleanliness is prudence .
And it came to pass , when Buddha was lifted up , that the birth of Lord Buddha , and his wisdom , and his Mahaparinirvana were under one tree .

Although while returning I saw that some people are going to Modi very microbes .
If you hear this phone call then it will be understood .

The propaganda of sanctuary started from Kashi Ghat has become a garden with your inspiration .
Wherever I go, my government instruments are making the Swachhta programme, but in the middle of the society, cleanliness has also become a festival.

All these things of the country know how carefully you can imagine how much joy you can imagine this thing .
I also tell all those who encourage this cleanliness program .
Somebody gave me some advice .
Actually the advice is very special .
I will not tell me whether I can do it .
Modi Garu , when you decide your tourism then what kind of tourism you want to tell them , how much is your cleanliness level .
Treatment is good but I should think .
But make such a garden . It is very good to clean such tons of so many tons of tons of tons of things .

In a way, Mann Ki Baat has given a new vision to the programme.
Some of our friends have also discussed with me sometimes while working on the book of words in this mind.
I'm lying down to Akbar.

It is to give advice , information that we are in our nature .
Many people try to give me advice , to reach me some or the other in their life .
With some good hand you keep changing your intelligence , energy , capacity according to the conditions .
Some people tell their advice at the place of working , on hearing the rest of them they also consult with the purpose of changing their support .
Not only this when I proposed anything then it is very happy to remember such things .
After that many people from all corners of the country of Narendra Modi App , MyGov have said that they have made some creative efforts to see food vain .
Some videos were also sent to me .
There are roti banks at some places .
One , Maharashtra , Gujarat is the establishment day of the states of Gujarat .
This conclusion is many luxuries for the people of these two states .
Both the states have made constant efforts to cross several new development peaks and have given their support to the progress of the country.
In both the states their life keeps on encouraging us continuously , every type of society of society .
Reminding these great men , on the day of independence of the state , on the day of independence , on the occasion of independence , that is , 2022 , we should take all our states , all our society , all our cities , all our families .
To strengthen this contribution one should move ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states have many luxuries .
In our country the rapidity of summers living in May , June has to be felt in the month of April .
Therefore this time I have given advice to take some precautions in this summer while talking to my mind , maximum advice has been given advice to take some precautions .

It is said that Balkani , Dabana , water for birds .
In many families small children have also seen this work .
Once this work comes in their sight , if birds come ten times a day or if there is water in the cup kept then they keep going to see whether there is water .
It gives us a sports but in reality it is a marvellous feeling to lift up the feeling of peace in the minds .
Although all the things related to animals , natural life with nature are very well known in our country but it is important to give strength to such efforts .
When I am the main minister of Gujarat then Dawdi Bohra society came hundred years to the Guru Saidana .

Sometimes we become so unconscious that they were wearing paper , milk , vegetables , Post Man , in these summers somebody would drink good water in the gate .
Young friends , I want to talk to you also .
In our youth many people like to spend their life in corporate zones sometimes I feel obstacles .
Mothers are also playing their thoughts in a protective environment .
There are also people living in different parts of this but most of the camp zones are seen .
Now the tests have been done , they are put to enjoy the guests .
Cosmetics are good only after summer season .
How do I want to tell your summer winters like a friend .
Some people definitely usefully , tell me that I have faith .
If you want to listen to this , do not see , do not think , do not want to go to unknown places .
Try to make new places , new experiences , new genetics .
I want to know why your interest is in these summer holidays .
Take new use .
The use should be positive , keep you out of your computer zone .
We are of the comfortable families of the middle class .
What is the matter of those travellers , what do they get down at the station .
In the evening go to your football with your football , volleyball or some other sports .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that in that game you will get the pleasure of never enjoying life .
If the child spending such life in the society gets the opportunity of playing with you then what changes come in their life .
If you also go once then I can say with faith that you want to go again .
This experience teaches you a lot .
It has come to reduce the distances of technology , but its ill effects have changed that six men living in one house are also present in one room to imagine the distance between them .

If we pay attention to the country full of many varieties then we get to learn something near us .
If you do not come to swim , learn swimming , if you do not come to the best boat then try to take something on the pocket .
If we feel small tasks then sometimes we can learn some tasks of our mind .
You will have to learn the cost of car but if you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You might have been pressing the cycle but do you ever try to run the Trichal vehicle to take people
You see , not only this new efforts , new experts give you happiness , but your life tied in one condition can also be taken out in it .
Keep showing insects to your friends .
I am telling my experience , how much learning the world , how much we can not even imagine .
See new places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new places .
But before going wherever you go , try to see a curiosity like a curiosity , knowing , asking people , asking water etc .
Therefore you get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends, this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
New generations get rid of the river near the river .
They do not need the river .
They started believing digital concentration.
Do you also believe , but do you ever want to get it through this plan
The Government of India has made a plan .
You're gonna be downloading BIM App.
Send it to each other .
If you do twenty people in the day then you will get two hundred rupees in the evening .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
In this way, your cooperation will be in building a Digital India.
New India becomes a comparison to each other .
And the holidays , and the evening .
Refresh - Organize .
Normally there is a dry atmosphere towards VIP culture in our country .
Now even if red light has gone on vehicles , then red light has gone out in the brain .
I am speaking to Shiva Chaube from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, Prime Minister Garu.
I want to talk about the government's decision red beacon tonight ban.
I felt very proud to read it .
Now my time was also so important that it was enjoyed .
I don't want to interfere in the traffic jam.
I would like to thank you for this decision.
Red light by the government 's decision is a part of the system .
New India emotions are increasing the importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country.
I say IPI in place of VIPs, my feelings are clear - every person is imported.
Every person has the importance , every person has the importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , if we accept all the greatness of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is to realize the great dreams .
Do this work together .
My dear countrymen , we will always remember our history , our culture , our traditional times .
Therefore we get strength , inspiration .
This year all the 125 crore people of our country are celebrating their thousands of Ramayana dynasty .
Because of some reason we are so small that we are thinking so small that more than one century .
Think of cosmetics .
These are also difficult to come out by cutting the social jewellery .
How was that thousands before .
Ramayana had done a very big fight against the evil , description of the society , irregularity , species etc . while many people knew .
They have imagined all those who take the society through their own ornaments , they have imagined them .
Before thousands of thousands he got permission to enter the house , all of them got permission to enter the house .
In every age to end the evil of the society of that time our societies keep on coming from our society .
Today we are celebrating a thousand Jayanti of Ramayana , in the attempts to encourage social unity from him we do not refresh the immense strength of the immense strength .
The government of India is releasing a Tapala stone in the memory of Swami Ramayanacharya on one day of May .
I am dedicated to Swami Ramjacharya , I am dedicated to Adarpur .
There is another speciality of my dear country , tomorrow .
It is celebrated at many places in the world as a day of labour.
When the word came on the day of the workers , when there was a discussion about the workers , it was natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedakar .
Now I would like to tell about Babasaheb Ambedkar, Swami Ramanjacharya, the saints of the twelfth century of Karnataka, the social worker Jagadguru Basaveshwar ji.
In the twelveth century he had done deep thoughts on the subjects of hard work in Kannada language .
It is said that in Kannada Bashan he was Kai Kavilas .
It means that you can get the houses of Shiva by your industry.
That is , heaven gets heaven by doing work .
If you want to say in other words , Shree Shiva .
If I am talking about the labors then it is natural to remember Dattopant Tangdi .
People of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddha Purnima .
All the followers of Buddha Lord Buddha are celebrated worldwide .
I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United States on Buddha Purnima.
This year it happens in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
There is a chance of reminding their memories .
My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas in India.
When Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas is in India, it is not only for India but also for the world.
Especially our neighbouring countries also come .
Our neighbouring countries should be helpful , development should be done for them .
Many uses keep on happening .
On May 5, India has used South Asia Museum.
This museum is capable of fulfilment , how useful to fulfil the economic , developmental priorities of South Asia .
This museum helps in making a picture of natural forests , tele-medicine i . . education , education , technology of technology , efforts to contact people .
My dear countrymen, the sunshines are rapid, save yourself, save yourself.
Most of the families of the country stay in the tests of their children .
In the families of those who have tested the atmosphere of cosmetics , tests , there is an atmosphere of cosmetic stress in their families .
In such a situation, I can tell you that once again listen to what I have told the students in Mann Ki Baat.
In a historical war happening against unrighteousness Bangladesh had successfully successfully in Bangladesh .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh 's brothers , brothers , brothers and sisters want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
India continues to provide full support to the development of the country by protecting peacefulness in this jungle by mixing with you as a strong partner, a good friend.
The memory of our Ravindranath Tagore is the pride of giving the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the creation of our Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore .
An interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person to give the Nobel Prize in 1913 and not only did the British give him a 'Knighthood'.
In 1919 Rabindranath Tagore was also one of the opposite Mahamans who were opposite to the British in Jalianwala Bagh .
This incident has a strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood of playing singinginging this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 if twelve twelve small Bhagwans were loved , inspiration standing in the inspiration of all of us .
These three days Christian March on 23th day of the month of March , he climbed two friends Sukhdev , Rajguru English .
All of us know that without the death of this incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , without the death of three , we all know that the happiness of the mother of India has remained .
We cannot even keep the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru.
Yat British Empire was scared of these three .
They were in jail while they were in jail , how were the worries with them .
Therefore nobody had to pay attention to 24th honey in the month of March , on 23th March the training was done .
Besides this their dead bodies were brought to the Punjab region .
When I went to that place for the first time a kind of spectacles were included in my body .
Whenever I get the opportunity, I inspire the youth of the country to visit the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and Batkeshwar.
At that time call for independence , its acuteness , its quantity is increasing .
On one hand they inspired the youths for the revolution of war like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
Just before this on the 10th April of 1917 Mahatma Gandhi had discovered Mahatma Gandhi 's death .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom struggle of India Gandhi Vadan , Gandhiji 's behavior style has been known at the time of killing for the first time .
Specially this incident is a milestone in the whole journey of fighting for independence .
During this time, the Sammelan of Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Mill Carmittee of Ahmedabad, all of them have a strong impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts, behavior style.
In 1915, only two works were done by a man who returned to India.
The capability of the masses, the strength of the Indian society, the power to know the nervous system, the way we can see Gandhiji's universal form, inspiring, inspiring and fighting, etc.
If we know about Gandhiji at the time of Champaran Satyagraha happening a hundred years ago , then how much is the truth of any person starting a normal life .
How to start normal life , how much industry , Gandhiji could learn from him .
Like Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalani , all of us were sent to Gandhi village at the same time .
In the work of working with people , how to teach it the color of freedom fight .
A wonderful balance is located in the work style of Gandhiji .
The desire of hundred crores of people , attempts to bring changes are the strong foundation of India .
There's a desire, a resolution, a enthusiasm.
O my dear countrymen , if we come out of the lives of the cosmetics , seeing the works happening in the society with cosmetics , if we try to understand what happens in the society , then the goal of the goal of the goal of the goal of the goal of the goals , for the society , for the responsibility of the society , for the responsibility of the society , for the lice , for the lice .
It's also doing their work like a penance, like meditation, like a kiss service.
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday .
That is , they are all running along with blood donation .
Those who give food habits to food are many .
Once it is seen in the form of a collective , incidents it is known with such a big power .
All these are not celebrated with the budget evening , government procedures , government funds .
But sometimes you will see the country and the dream of a New India of hundreds of crores of people will be fulfilled before our eyes.
It is said that everybody should keep the responsibility of Pauri Dharamshala .
Then the same New India starts a swimming .
We recall the 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, Bhagat Singh, Sukh Dev and Raj Guru.
Champaran saturation is done .
Are we also a part of the journey from Swaraj to Surajya by pledging our lives and committing them
In the last few months there has been a month of any environment in our country , very high people have participated in digital , digital jewellery .
After the rubbing of mouth many types of designs have been seen .
Bhima app is being started only for two and a half months and nearly one and a half crore people have downloaded this app.
We have to move ahead to fight against the people of my country , black money , which is running towards water .
Can the people of hundreds of old crore people of the country imagine that in this year two and a half thousand crore Digital Lava Devis can be celebrated .
We declared in the budget.
If this work done for hundred crores of people of the country then there is no work of staying for one year .
You can complete in six months .
We can do all these in daily life .
By this you can not imagine how much you can serve the country . black money , which can become a soldiers in fighting against water .
In the last few days many programs have been done for providing all these , to make people aware .
Hundreds of such programs have been concluded in the country of Yavad .
80 - 85 programs have been done .
The beauty built for traders were fifty thousand people .
Everybody has contacted this work ahead .
Earlier on 14 April 14 Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti this Digital fair ends .
A big last program has been celebrated on the completion of hundred days .
The biggest dragon is determined in it .
I believe that the time of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti remains with us , besides this Bhima Yap is being published .
We will make our part to reduce the behavior of the river , to reduce the behavior with mouth .
My dear countrymen, I am happy to have many kinds of suggestions when I have asked for advice every time for the words in the mind.
But in the matter of cleanliness pills keep listening to every time .
I bow down to you, the Honble Chief Minister, the Prime Minister, and I bow down to you.
First of all you will have many luxuries to spend this time with extremely Ooty .
I want to talk to you in my mind .
I want to tell people how important is cleanliness .
People travel daily on a river polluting very badly .
Our house comes on the Rispana bridge of that river .
I recognize it cleanly .
I want to be angry at the hearts of hundred crores of people .
Once the anger starts , if we start feeling satisfaction , then we apply something or the other .
The best , the active participant is , the garden is so important for them .
But cleanliness always remains tied with a habit of garden .
I believe that this feeling awakened in the students of the country , children , students , youths in the youths is a good result .
We know that we have eaten in the house , we also put food in our glass after extraordinary diet .
After putting everything in the cup there is difficulty to eat .
In which half of them can not be put in the stomach , they leave there .
Have you ever thought how much damage we are being done by leaving these smokes
If you do not leave such a scream , then everyone can fill the stomach of the lice at any time .
It is not a matter of knowing this .
It is said that in our houses the small children can eat as much as they can eat .
But such a thing is that it is also good for the family .
They made some mobile apps.
In every state of our country such people will be seen somewhere .

The United Kingdom has set a goal of Universal Health Coverage by 2030.
This time the 7th April of the ECG has paid attention to the depression of the World Health Organisation .
According to one estimate people suffering from mental depression on 35 crores of the world .
The danger is that even in those around us we do not like to talk about this thing as well .
The person suffering from depression also does not talk about it because the person is also ashamed to discuss it.
I want to tell the people of the country that I am not able to get rid of depression .
On making a mental environment one starts getting relief .
The first mantra is that instead of suppression it is necessary .
Tell your friends , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , meditations with you .
The children living in the hall sometimes get so much trouble because of loneliness .
The privilege of our country is that we have grown in the speculative households and we are mixed with big households so there is no shape of depression.
They are the first step towards depression .
This is the best way .
This depression becomes the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes becomes the root of all kinds of diseases , as if depression is not standing , fighting , adventurous decisions , taking all the ability to take decisions .
There is also another way .
When you meet others , when someone served , then you can easily lighten the weight of your mind .

Its strength is that if there is any tuberculosis to capture India from a distance of 2000 kms, then we have the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , when we get a new victory of science then we enjoy .
In the journey of the development of human life Taluku has played a very important role .
Special scientific , efficient people do not let their gynaecology be like a gynaecology .
The same gynaecology becomes the cause of new research .
Their questions are not able to sleep .
If we look at the journey of thousands of years of development of human life , then we can say that there is no such thing for the journey of this human life .
This is impossible .
Everything of Brahmanda , creation rules , human mind keeps on trying to know .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
When we talk about my beloved youths , science , scientists , scientists , then I have come to tell you that many times in the words of ' Mann Ki Baat ' -LRB- in mind -RRB- we have to increase the attraction of science in our youth .
Many scientists are important for the country .
Today scientists become a permanent change in the lifestyle of future generations .
Mahatma Gandhi said that no science has droped from the sky in a perfect form.
Keeping in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , they should consider any meditation , any technique , because the same is most beneficial for the common man .
I felt that how to identify such creative creativity , exhibiting them , providing information to the people , how to use such creative inventions for the people , how to produce them at a height , how to use them in voluntary ways etc .
I saw a discovery of this .
In 2005, there were more rains in Mumbai.
This means that in the society , in the country , people playing this kind of role are very popular .
Our society is also very technological direction .
All the arrangements are also running in the direction of technology .
In a way technology has become a different part of our life .
In the last few days the vagina of Digestion has been very strong .
Gradually people are moving ahead towards digital concentration .
Digital Ladwa Devi is also developing very fast in India .
Especially youngsters are adopted to celebrate their digital sisters from their mobile phones .
I am considered to be a sign of this .
Just a few days ago, the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana' have received heavy remuneration in our country.

I want to tell you a joyful thing .
Our brother , brothers and sisters filled our grains .
This seventh year cereals have been produced in the record level with the hard work of rails in our country .
Our rails told all the signals that all the old records were bound .
This time fruits in the fields , it seems as if Pongal , Baisakhi festivals are celebrated everyday .
This year about two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of the country have been produced food grains .
The name of our rails is emotional Akhri record this time 8  more emotional .
This is so successful that it is not known .
I am specially impressing the rails of the country .
Because apart from traditional fruits , keeping in mind the poor people , different kinds of pulses are cooked because the poor give the most protein with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of the poor people in the country near about two hundred and nine hundred lakh hectares of pulses of different kinds of pulses have given me a lot of joy .
This is not only the production of various kinds of pulses but also the important service done for the poor people of my country .
How did my prayer , all my listening , how my country ' s rails were troubled to lift up , and produced pulses record , therefore my brothers and sisters were specially impressed .
My dear countrymen, some or the other work is being done by the government in our country, through the society, through institutions and by everybody.
In a way everybody seems to be behavior related to cleanliness in some form .
The government is also trying continuously .
Six house toilet pits were empty , healed them .
Twin Pitt toilets were empty , then the rulers had seen the methods of using those toilets again .
How do we clean other cleanlinesss , this toilet can also be cleaned .
Because when an IADS ruler himself cleanses the toilets then it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
Six members fill a Standard Town Toilet five feet .
After that he can easily turn into another bit .
In six to twelve months the evil reached in the toilet umbrella gets completely burnt .
The way the government takes this before , others also use such before .
In the government also cleanliness bird festivals keep on happening continuously in various departments .
On the first side of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, will also give a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We welcomed the exhibition of our Divyang Sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.

The matter is related to playing , space related to space , our country women do not take anyone .
They are moving ahead on foot , they are increasing the country with their victory .
In the Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy, the women players of our country celebrated Rajat Path.
My heartfelt congratulations to all of them.
On 8th March the whole world is also celebrated the day of women .
The 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' garden has moved faster.
This is not only a government program .
A social movement has become a mass education programme.
Last two this program attracted the hearts of common people .
The problem of surroundings of the country has brought about changes in the thinking of the people of the country.
On knowing how much joy is there on knowing the news that the child is born .
In a way the opposite of increasing girls is the cause of their social civilization .
The nearest airport from Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is Karipur International Airport .
Not only this children can stop marriages on approximately 175 .

New thoughts are drowned with it .
They are changing according to the needs of the province .
My dear countrymen, I have sometimes got the opportunity to talk to you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You are also with activeness .
I know how much from you .
What happens , in villages , poor people come to Nadaka .
For your support I will be able to fulfil your support .
Man Ki Bath , August 2019 .
Today our country is enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand on the other hand some or the other festival of Hindustan , the festival of Deepavali keeps on happening .
Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, there is no slowdown in the society, the economic cycle has been imparted the life system of society.
So far we celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Sri Krishna Mahotsav has been done all over India .
If there is such personality , even after spending thousands of years , every festival brings a new spirit , somebody can imagine new energy .
Today I am talking to you about two important monasteries .
One was the hypnotise of Sudarshan Chakradhar , one was the hypnotise of Charkhadhar .
And when Sudarshan Chakradhar had left the shore of Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and settled in Dwarka city , the hypnotise born in the sea shore came to Yamuna , and spent the last moments of life in Delhi .
In the condition of Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohan had completely used his intelligence , his ability , his ability , his wisdom to stop the war , to stop the war .
At the same time, India is in the process of another big festival.
Not only India , this church happens all over the world . O my beloved people .
I am talking about Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary.
He served the rails being recognized in the church .
In order to remove many deformities situated in the matter of blood pitta disease they themselves have served the patients of blood pitta .
Through the service his life was standing as an example .
We can understand this thing directly from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi was mainly the person , society , humans , humans .
Finx Farm of Africa , Tolstoy Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha , all the places , in a special way the society of the society , computer Mobilization has been their support .
It is important to bring all these emotions of society , society , Community Ceremony Mobilization in our business life .
If you want to tell the truth then this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , real work .
We are associated with people in the society , with all the classes , with all ages , with all ages , the village of the village is a man or with everyone , what can I try to do as a person .
What will be the cost of my generation .
Community is our strength .
In the programs happening in this 150 years the community , service is also not available .
Our woman is Ladies Club .
In the modern era, we have done the work of Ladies Club, but we have joined the meetings of Ladies Club.
You can do a lot.
By collecting books, sharing of knowledge, sharing of knowledge, 130 crore Indians, 130 crore imaginations can be started.
There is no limit in the mind that if good aspirations, goodness and harmony can be sufficiently served with full integrity.
It is also sufficient for a unique pleasure .
My dear countrymen, I went to Dadi in Gujarat a few months ago.
It is a very important reflection of salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle.
I attended a state-of-the-art museum inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three-four words while expressing your feelings along with those photographs .
During the coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context I want to share with you an interesting thing .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time, a zealous exhibition was organised in the Indian building of Venice Biennale with Gandhi memories.
In this Haripura Panels are specially interesting .
In Haripura of Gujarat the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary in which the history of Subhash Chandrabos is remembered .
This art is a beautiful past for Panel.
Prior to the Haripura meeting of Kangras, in 1937-38, the temporary Principal Nandlal Bose of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Art Bhavan was invited.
Gandhiji called for exhibition of his art work in the meeting to showcase the lifestyle of those living in India through art.
The artificial work of our state is this Nandal Bose .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic artistic .
Tourists of nearby villages of Nandlal Bose Haripura , finally a art canvas has been made by showing the life of India .
There was a great discussion in Venice about this invaluable artistic program.
I would like to take a resolution from India, with the best wishes of Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary.
Do something for the country , society , for others .
That's the right, real paramount activity of Bapu.
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time, we came out of our houses and dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi by suffering.
House , streets , streets , but art galleries , but art galleries should be organised in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
On August 15, while talking from the Red Fort, how did the countrymen of hundreds of crores of people enthusiastically perform the Swachhata Garden with energy and work to get rid of defecation in the Bahraang region.
By the way, we all have to stop the single use plastic.
All sections of the society are excited about this propaganda.
With this money remains sufficient, its role in the protection of environment is played.
This time in the context of celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of 2 October Bapuji, we laid the foundation stone of the project against plastic and dedicated to them from the excretion of Bahraang.
I am applying one to all the classes of the society , every village , every city .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from plastic .
All the Municipality of the country , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , private institutions , everybody has heard me that plastic Kuppa should be administered .
I urge all the corporate sectors to examine how to set up a disposal if this plastic west is serving at one place.
It can be done by recycle .
It can be used in fuel .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
Food is very important in our culture .
As much as we were also included in science .
The Nutrition Abhiyan is becoming a massive nutrition in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting methods .
Once a thing came in my eyes .
There was a big garden like rice filled in Nashik.
In it in the days of the harvest the Anganbari services of Anganbari are serving one pinch of grain from the people .
These cereals are made to make hot food for women , children .
In this the person donating donor is becoming a civilization of a aware society .
This culture is celebrated during feeding the child for the first time .
Drink food is not honourable .
In Gujarat, in 2010, one thought was that why should not it be necessary to give a complimentary food to children in the context of food processing
This is very important before , it can be participated everybody .
People in many states eat food .
The feeling of service , joy and joy is a marvellous collection .
Friends , by many such small methods our country can be influenced by fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , rich people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated as Nutrition Abhiyan all over the country.
This time, when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, there was a lot of questions about this thing.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went to meet my people, there was a proposal about Man vis Wild.
Since then I did not imagine that the chances of spectacular hearts of the world come in my life .
But what happened .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
Whenever I come to the forefront of visiting the Prime Minister, I am spending some time with me about five-ten minutes in the world because of the International Yoga Day.
Those who have not discussed Yoga in the world's largest grounds, I am telling you about this thing all over the world.
Discovery Chanal has planned this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate Jastis , clean environment in our country .
But one more interesting thing is that some people are asking me one thing, Modi ji, say that you are talking in Hindi, not Hindi for Bear Grills.
After this the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
Then what happened to shoot again .
Many questions are questioned .
Look , there is no secret in it .
This question is in many minds. Okay, I tell this secret now.
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, technology has been fully used in the interaction with Bear Grills.
As I told you, it's been done in English, and Bear Grills kept a small card lens in the ears because it's happening.
Therefore, if I speak in Hindi, it is a miracle of technology that has become easier to speak to him in English.
After this Show many people are seen talking about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to places where nature , wildlife , staying .
What is the nature
You will stay watching .
Your internal is also large .
On 15 August I heard you from the Red Fort . at least 15 places in the three third places of India , 15 places of India are completely tourist center .
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought will be large .
My beloved country , environment protection , conservation meaning conservation is naturally seen .
In the last month I have been lucky to release the population of tiger in the country .
You know how many tigers are there in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . thousand nine hundred and sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
In 2010, a tiger was held in St. Peters Burg, Russia.
In which information about reducing the number of tigers has been taken a contribution .
The number of tigers in the world of 2022 is doubled .
But this is now a new India. We will fulfil the goals soon.
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of wilderness , community reserves has increased .
While releasing the tiger detail I also recognized the lions of Gujarat .
When I responsibilities were responsible then the residence of lions in the jungles .
Their number was decreasing .
We took several churches one by one in Gir.
In 2007 the decision was taken to make women gardens there .
We have enhanced the infrastructure for enhancing tourists.
When talking about the nature , wildlife then the conservation of conservation is done .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards compassion .
Therefore we should not only save forests , trees , wildlife , they should also give appropriate environment to increase in the right way .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget Swami Vivekananda's historical text in September 11, 1893
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 29th August, I will celebrate the National Sports Day.
In this context, we are starting the Fit India Movement across the country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit .
All their descriptions are told now .
Watch 29 August .
Besides this 02 October is a complete plastic cosmetic .
In order to get rid of plastic all of us stay with mind at all places at home , home .
I know that in social media about this matter .
Come , let us move ahead with a new alternative , new energy .
I'm waiting for your information, for your words.
Come, let us move forward to realize the dreams of the freedom fighters, the dreams of Gandhiji and the dreams of freedom fighters.
Man Ki Bath - talk in the mind .
O my dear countrymen , Namaskar .
On 26 January 26 January the whole country celebrated with enthusiasm .
The State of India, the people of the country, the empowerment of the people of the country, our dedication towards democracy, all these are the festivals of our countrys culture, which makes the previous generations aware of the responsibilities of democracy.
But now the responsibility of people in our country , how deep , how deep , how much church has to be done in our country it does not happen so much .
To morrow 30 January our worship was the pilgrimage of Bapuji .
We pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country on January 30 at 11.
This is natural way in the society , country .
Two minutes also pay attention to the convenience , convenience , Amarvir .
In our country there is a natural ornament towards army , security forces .
I am impossible to all the members of their family members who were honored with various books in the morning of this Ganapati festival .
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Vishisht Service , Special service etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then besides surprising we also get inspiration from pride .
On January 26, when we were honoured and enthusiastic, our soldiers in Kashmir were engaged in the defence of the country and all of us died due to the breakdown of ice climate.
I am paying tribute to all these virgins .
My youth , all of you know well , I keep talking in my mind continuously .
January , February , March , April all the months of April are time in every family .
In the house there are tests for two children , in the house that test is done on everyone .
The student friends , their students , their teachers , this is the right time to talk to their teachers because I went somewhere , whose tests were found to be a big problem .
Everybody, family, students, students, and everybody seem to be surprising, and a big strange mental environment is seen in every household.
Seeing them I want to divide the thoughts coming in my mind .
The message of telephone came from creation .
Listen , what creation says , I want to tell you what , during the tests , in our house , neighbouring houses , in our society there is a terrible environment in our society .
Because of this reason students become unsuccessful .
People who want to enjoy enjoyment are suffering from stress .
Therefore my goal is to consider the tests as a festival .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best Satta situated in us comes out .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Whatever is the best .
Festival climate test is removed .
Therefore I told all my parents that you change all these three-four months in the environment of enthusiasm .
The truth is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kutch to Kamrup , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh these three-four months tests are done .
That's why I call you all "smile mor, score mor".
If you are angry then all the doors are closed .
You have not told anyone .
Why did you remember that you came out of stress .
Therefore , there is an important medicine to increase memory which is relax .
Through my own experience, I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things, but when relaxed, we remember how many things we do not imagine.
Therefore, 'A Happy Mind' is the second for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it is said that we can not see the test from the right point of view .
It is not a life test .
How do you live , how to live , how to live everything is not tested .
Besides the tests given by the mouthbook in the classroom, you have to face many more tests in your life so that there is a need to be absorbed from the glimpse of life.
J.
The important example of Abdul Kalam is in front of all of us .
He had reached the airways .
They are not found .
Somebody has sent a question of enjoyment . In this time I have seen the biggest challenge that students have become the center of test .
That is why I want to know your thoughts about the future of education .
There is a question in their question but Rucha Garud also wanted to know my opinion .
You say , do you have a family doctor to show your family so much .
You see his experience , knowledge , how much use he is .
He also called the 'Pratispharth' of Rucha Garu.
This is a big psychological war.
Many acquaintances are the speciality of the life of the players that they competition with themselves .
It is a marvellous life journey to move ahead every time by stopping its record for twenty years .
Because he desired the way according to every responsibilities .
Friends, If you go to the test in every field of life, you can hide the time of reading peacefully two hours before three hours.
If you want to get up at the time of decided then you can not get up at the time of determination .
Before this the cost of test was not taken to sleep , now it is falling .
It gives birth to that energy inside itself .
If you want to say comfortably, you will see three important aspects in comparison to anyone.
And he said , My mother did not read much .
But sitting with me asked me to lift me up .
Adopt that .
Use as much capacity as you have .
Once you learn to accept , the main problems end from there .
In the roots of the problem there is a belief of conservation , studies .
Several years ago - we were in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India, Ganesh Dada Mavankar, his son, once came to see M. P.
If you want to say in a way , when the person suffering from unhealthy then we fear him with the name of disease .
I told the conservation that sometimes we also move like this with children .
In the days of test the child has to make the situation of laughing simple while laughing .
By doing this , the weather changes .
I got a painting phone call.
And he spake not his name .
Why do you understand that he can not tell his name
Therefore I began to try a lot .
I tried to find its methods so that my time became very old .
If we try to see how much time we were trying to see , how much time I had increased that time I had to read properly , they were able to read .
Seeing how you see it swim towards the way to fail life .
If you are taken in the test then your life will be destroyed .
If you don't get caught, I will do this for the entire life, not only in your mind but also in your mind.
When you have to tell your children then you can not talk to their eyes properly .
If you are also turning your roads into a net then I have seen that how many people are using new methods to see how much they spend for seeing their entire creativity.
The same creativeness , at the same time it is not necessary to see at the same time .
The consequences of their own problems are available , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
Your teachers , your parents ask me .
Because students pay attention to sports are generally considered to be less attention towards reading .
Definitely the thought of Asli is wrong .
The rest of the body is also important .
Give a break for at least five minutes .
You will know that your work is easy .
It is not known to everyone but this is my experience .

After the terrible crisis in 2013, such a number of pilgrims reached here for the first time.
All of you have a feeling that you should go to those places where the country has been beautiful in the past.
Tourist visits to the people of our country to see these beauty in our country, none of these big teachers will be able to know the spirit of our people.
On the other hand, there has been a lot of heavy years in the country.
Today the Christians of the world are celebrated on the day of this festival .
This is my luxury for everybody .
My young friends .
On one side tests . on the other hand T-20 cricket is the World Cup match .
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match .
Under some days Pakistan , Bangladesh has spent India in two good matches with water .
We are looking at a good zone in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, India and Australia are ready to play the waters and these two waters are my best wishes.
65 percent of our country 's population is not seen any reason for staying away from milk in the world .
This is not the work done .
We need to bring opposite changes in sports .
We can see this place in India .
Like cricket, the interest in football, hockey, tennis and cabins is increasing here.
You will be aware that in the coming year of FIFA-17 World Cup, India has been hosting.
We have come to our country to play twenty four waters from all over the world .
In 1951 , in 1962 Indian football hair glimpsed gold in ASEAN Games and in 1956 Olympic Games the hair of India stood in fourth place .
Fortunately we slipped from there for some decades in the past .
I don't even want to say about how low our rankings are in the FIFA.
On the other hand, I am passing through the growing interest of football in the youth of India, which is not English Premier Leg or Leg or Indian Super Leg match.
Indian youth are taking time to know about these matches, but to see them in the telephone.
I have said that when we are increasing so much towards this sports then we have the opportunity to give guests to AIDS - 17 World Cup then we will not fulfill our responsibility only by playing the role of the guests .
Or do we encourage sports using this opportunity to benefit us
If we talk about football , football , football , football all this year then we should create the environment of changing this year - if we talk in schools , art galleries , then every corner of India .
Our children should be wet with sweat while playing football in our youth , markets .
It has happened , to give guests we get a synonym of joy .
Therefore we try to take all the football village , streets .
From now on, IFFA-17 World Cup in 2017 will fill a variety of inspirations in the youth.
It is better to give guests to this program that there are many basic sports here .
We can do ourselves with this sports of every youth of our country .
How can we increase the interest in the youth of India towards this game through the FIFA-17 World Cup
How can the cost of comparison to this game be done in the government , educational institutions , social institutions .
We are watching this place in cricket
We should also try to make other sports departments .
I am supposed to have a chance to identify the capabilities of the youth of India in the world - whether it is a match or not in the meaning of Odama.
2017 Afghan Afghan - 17 World Cup will be ready to host energy capabilities and exhibit them.
By doing so, we can also do broadening of Indias commitment.
You can send me your advice and suggestions on the 2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup through Narendra Modi App
How should the songs be ,
What should be done in Savanir .
Think about friends .
Each young man, every young man, 2017 should be the messenger of FIFA under-17 World Cup.
You should participate in this program at a big height .
This is a golden opportunity to make India's destination.
You will think that my beloved students , wherever you want to travel in holidays .
Water going to foreign countries is very less .
We should take this work further .
This time also do this work .
It is said that the journey without examination was like a wingless bird .
If you are really interesting to see them , then you should also prepare the international view of seeing them .
Travelling in improving life plays a powerful role .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing , gynaecology .
In the first days they do not go on the way to everybody , they are not going on the way .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the guests there , then how would it be so much .
But this bugyal has shown the guests of Venice Calcutta Limited .
Near the Savaner village near Nagpur the Eco French Mountain Tourist Centre has been taken up to 10,000 people .
If you want to see some new thing then this gives us a chance .
This time when you go to tour the holidays then what can you do for cleanliness .
In scientific method this attempt is not done but work is done .
But if we want to make 125 crore people of the country tourism then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
And our crores can show the opportunity of the youth .
Government Gani , institutions , society , people , people mixed it with the beauty of Gani .
Come , let us try this direction .
My beloved young friends , on holidays I do not like to make some vanity in the city .
If you do not swim , then you can contact swimming in holidays .
If there is no cycle then you can take a decision to learn cycle in holidays .
Now if you want to typing on computer with only two fingers then why should I not learn typing in the right way
There are many types of experts for the development of our personality .
Why do not learn them
Now look at a thought.
In this you need a lot of classes , training , very big physiotherapy , big budget .
You see your surroundings.
You must use your holidays to enhance your personality , to fulfil your skills .
This child reminded me of what I told me by photographing .
The child told me about a good work by photographing me .
I told me that many birds have become their friends .
How much love is the bird of Mahadevi Varma in Hindi language .
Come, let us also say as Mahadevi Varma Ji.
I am telling the good wishes to remember a special thing .
How kindly a problem of craft of Mysore has brought us ahead .
My beloved brother , brothers and sisters . Digital India you will have heard many times .
Digital India meaning this is related to youths in cities , which can see their world .
It is not true .
You will be happy to know that Kisan Suvidha App has come here for your convenience.
You should download this routine in your mobile phones . The details related to the environment will come in your own hands .
The button situated in it speaks to you directly with trade scientists , agricultural scientists .
If you ask any question then they answer .
You will tell you .
It is believed that my brothers , brothers and sisters load this Kisan Suvidha Yap on their mobile phones .
If you try to try once then what are you working in it .
There is a deficiency in it , there is less information that you can also make me a cannon .
Ratu waits for rain .
But if there is no water then all our countrymen should also think about what happens .
During this time, we stop flowing in our ponds, water flowing in our area, water flowing in the ponds, water flowing in the ponds, water flowing there due to infection or infection, so that the water storage decreases.
In the past we can make ready to reach the water after excavating the places , places of water in the past .
Filling ponds . If our rivers , canals are filled then after that there is no deficiency of water then we do not suffer much harm .
But if we keep holding the lap of every vehicle of water then it is possible .
This time it is possible to excavate five lakh water ponds .
Although now how much effort is necessary to be done in this direction .
My beloved brother , brothers and sisters . Italy Government of India has organised a heavy rail conference .
Everything should be in equal quantity .
That is why the expensive expenses are left .
And our destination is the lowest, the lowest and the lowest.
This mantra should be done , follow that we should increase in scientific methods in our agriculture .
This year, the festival has been organised with the aim of 'Bit Diabetes' all over the world.
It is said that in our country about six and a half crore people of diabetes are patients of diabetes .
Three percent deaths have become the cause of diabetes .
In diabetes two types of types of type . . .
Tip-1 genetic comes .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes .
Physiotherapy decreases .
There is no sweating .
What can we do in our personal life to smite diabetes by getting support from 7th April .
If you have yoga meaning yoga then do yoga .
Or do at least walk or running procedure .
If everybody is healthy in this India then my country is also healthy .
On 24th March the World Tuberculosis Day is celebrated .
When I heard the name of T . . at my small time they were afraid .
It seems as if the death was near .
But now there is no fear of T . . because now everyone knows that the treatment of T . . is possible .
On the top of T . . is such a disease that they also recognize , two neighbours .
There are more than 13,500 microscope centres in our country and more than four lakh dot services are available in our country.
This test is also done freely .
You can test once .
This disease goes away .
If you have to get proper treatment , treatment is done till the time the disease is completely cured .
There are some important contributions in the month of April . mainly on 14 April Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedakar Jayanti .
He completed the year of 125th Jayanti .
His birthplace in Mahavi, his education in London, his Diksha in Nagpur, 26 in Delhi, 26 in Alipur Road, his last activity in 1997.
We are constantly trying to develop these Panchatirths .
I have the privilege of displaying his healthy Mahava on April 14.
Baba Saheb has given us how much inspiration to change a good civilization .
By changing a good civilization on his way we can pay homage to him in a glorious way .
In some days the Vikram Sanctuary starts new year .
It is celebrated in different states .
You can hear your mobile phone.
For this only one missed call has to be done .
This service has begun for months but 35 lakh people have used it .
You also come to November .
It is so happy that I am so happy with you .
In 2017, I would like to know from you how excellent we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup for our benefits.
How to do this program .
The FIFA program provides a special opportunity to do this.
They have drawn photographs of such beautiful places that they really enjoy seeing them.
I consider it a good signal .
Whereever feet do not move , love to smoke feet there .
This conclusion is considered to be the special impression of Kolkata India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is very backward in the field of tourism .
You can also think like this .
You'll tell me one thing to think.
See - you will be happy .
In Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you again.
If you want to tell the truth , I forgot to recognize it .
You were happy with me to see this thing .
In order to take any church for the conservation of water we should take those churches with complete care .
In our body many other diseases are included in the house of our body as guests .
You must think of this thing.
Tuberculosis has come to the test of baboo .
It is said that what has come to him .
It means that what is this disease that is , it can also be tested very soon .
But you don't think that this work is not because of the government, doctors, medicines, hence it is my request to the people of the country.
Therefore , your mind also keeps on shining .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
As much as you have obstruction in the matter of your children 's test , there is an obstruction .
But if we change our thoughts towards tests , perhaps we get rid of this campaign .
I have said in Mann Ki Baat that you must not send your experiences and information through the Narendra Modi App.
Today, I am talking to my parents, testators and their teachers in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that in some days tests start .
Everybody asks how to go , how to test .
How many times come , how much score I told one .
You yourself decide the goal for you .
While playing cricket I kept many estimations on me , how much hoped from me .
The estimation of some estimations spent time has been named even more .
Then how important was I needed to find a result of this .
I have decided my goals myself , I can conduct them so much good for the country .
I was constantly trying to conduct those goals .
My vision has been fulfilled slowly on the ball .
Good luck.
You should make your future .
I believe that these words of Sachan are definitely useful for you .
Why should we not keep our support with us
Where we reached , how far came .
Do not stick in the number of numbers .
Deciding a more important goal for life, travel with a dream
Therefore if you make a large , high dream then tests change into a joyful festival .
In them healthy mind remains healthy in the body .
If you talk about that, our daily church should be consistent with our dreams and contributions for 365 days.
The information done specially is that you sleep regularly , waking up early in the morning , we need to get up from sleep .
Take the entry utensils of the test centres , other things should be reached before the determined time .
Do not do this .
I believe you do this .
Although in life the root cause of keeping the foundation of victory victory nutritious .
There is a strong foundation from regular symptoms .
They do the work of pooling in the morning without feeling unconscious , they do the work of pooling in the evening , how long do the work of pooling at noon .
Not only this , our daily routine is also impossible .
Therefore we should not see all these small sights .
Definitely, do it.
O my friends .
Sometimes I saw , two types of water are seen in the students going to the tests .
Who can say this thing better than me that it is the joy of Champion Vishwanathan built by the players of the world .
He divides his experiences with you .
Come , how to make these tests sports by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan.
How did I get ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been said that these tests are like problems occurring before life .
Therefore if you are calm , eating nutritious food , sleeping straight then your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay peaceful .
In the last minute very important stores , and look at the storeys that you have not remembered properly .
Vishwanathan is actually an important thing .
How much healthy he sits in the international chattering competitions , how much concentration you will be discovered .
Is Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird
You are standing on the bank of a pond and many things are seen in the water below .
The cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
If water is thin , then things asked in it are also seen .
It takes 30,40,50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things peacefully .
This can be my experience , you will also be useful .
Rajat Agarwal told a good thing .
He wrote in my app: We will comfortably interact with friends, family members at least half an hour every day.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
The country and outside the country are trying to reach the circumnavigation of that culture by unveiling the Rancharith Manas today.
Such worshipped Murari Babu has sent an important chitka for the students .
He is also a teacher , counseller , therefore there is a meeting of both his words .
If you go ahead with peace without any stress in your test then you will definitely succeed .
The pride of success is also pride .
By saying a poet, I will give my message and best wishes that there is no rule of thanks to everyone.
Learn to live with vaccines also .
I believe that the Mann Ki Baat programme of our Prime Minister is precious.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
How happy is this to me .
It seems very good to me that all this was born .
Now I want to say that start doing yoga from tomorrow . It will be unjust to you .
A very light result .
You must pay attention to it .
Look, you can do them.
Why do all these things hungry
Read these suggestions carefully . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question seems difficult .
Therefore tests of competition .
Do not stop , work without bending your energy .
I told all my young friends .
At the same time, remember one thing - there are many opportunities in this country.
Decid what you want to do in life , never take it .
You're playing.
Don't forget that this world's mother's children.
You also have the right to stay here as well as the mountains of trees .
You have to take hold , unconscious feeling , meditation .
With these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
If you want to do then I hope to successfully in every matter .
May God bless you .
See , how is a great scientist talking
What I take half an hour to say , they say that thing in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This is the strength of scientists .
I am giving thanks to the children of the country to give support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then you will also be afraid .
The future of gold is waiting for you .
Now a message from taste dabs on my app - has tasted the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the test the members of their family members keep trying continuously to stay in a social environment , this way exercise also happens in their families .
Sometimes many things are such that do not inspire us only to the students .
We all read about Thomas Elva Edison, who discovered electricity bulbs.
The lights are also filled in our life therefore it is said .
The cost of victory is also hidden in the victory . Shrinivas Ramjan meaning who do not know .
You will know that no traditional education has been done in the past .
Raling . Hari Port Siris this day has changed the whole world .
Tests are not only one of the students , entire family , school , students .
But the condition of alone student is not good without parents , teachers .
Vijay Jindal had written the weight of their hopes on children .
Today mothers do not want to say much .
Please do not fall in tension .
If someone speaks to a friend then do not want them.
Why do I say , friends , today national science day .
The scientific festival of the country is celebrated on 28 February 28 national science day .
February 28, 1928 - Sir C.
V . .
Raman declared his research Raman Effect.
The same research found him Nobel Prince .
That is why the country is celebrated in the form of 28 National Science Day .
Keep an eye on every generation .
Science , technology is not possible without technology .
Today the contribution of National Science Day has been strengthened in the country .
Knowledge , science , technology , all these should be a natural part of our development journey .
Moreover , this time National Science Day is ' Make in India ' .
Scientific-technological Innovations
But I want to tell this thing again to all the people of the country .
Along with adopting this research along with the principle of the main scientist of the last century this research has also been recognized in physiotherapy .
It is an opportunity to benefit all the human species , worldwide .
In this research procedure the kiss of our country , our meditation scientists also participate in it , their participation in it is enjoyable for all of us .
I would like to convey my best wishes to all those scientists.
In future also our scientists are making an effort to take this research forward .
India is also a part of the international craftsmanship.
In the past one important decision has been taken . In this research the laser interference of interferenceal gravitational observation has been told .
There is such arrangement at two places in the world .
India is third.
I am telling all the scientists once again .
My Mann Ki Baat can be heard from that number by calling the mid-day from tomorrow.
You can also hear in your mother language .
No. 81908-81908 to call Miss d.
On the second time I say November 81908 - 81908 .
I also have to test to morrow .
125 crore people of the country have tested me .
That is why we know .
Tomorrow is the budget .
As soon as you hear my words you know how healthy I am , how much self-confidence is with confidence .
Man Ki Bath , January 2016 .
I salute all of you.

This is a text of an old labourer, Dilip Singh Malviya, in Bhojpura village of Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
In Bhojpura village, he had made 100 roads to this extent, regarding this as a sacred task, without his physical hard work.
I extend my best wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
I hear a lot of ruthless news about our country.
This is the ability to move ahead.
Therefore, it seems to be very successful and helpful to keep Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the occasion of Yoga Day.
The mantra of Swachhta is transformed in every household.
Until now, there has been no detailed discussion on media.
However, I am confident that the media will reach such villages, and the lights of the country will be reflected.
The biggest benefit of this is that how happy and satisfactory it is to the people of the Government who are in the process of sending electricity.
We all should make efforts to make good things, good things, good things and good things that common man do.
This is also a service programme.
But I mean, don't I have to do it
Everybody will be able to handle my mobile phones by loading their mobile phones on Narendra Modi App Down.
I'm sharing small things in this app.
It is a matter of great pleasure for the people to tell me a lot of things through this app.

Once handicaped, or disabled, is called a person, especially a disabled person, so many such things are heard.

Whatever individuals, they have a divine or more components.
In schools, hospitals, government workshops, bus stands, railway stations, ropes, parking, lifts are available, creative efforts should be made to facilitate all these in Braille scripts - technology, systems, arrangements - a comfortable and sustainable vision.
They should not remain dead in files.

But the feeling that you've expressed is very true.
It's not real.
The residue of fruits is also very precious.
How does this benefit in eating cattle and it will also improve our land.
This kind of fertilizer is available on the ground.
There was a need to interact with the farmers who once used to artisans.
They told me about a good experience.

The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana provides funds to the disadvantaged.
Mudra encourages incentives.
The Mudra Payments are expected.
Mudra actually empowers.
The Mudra Yojana is aimed at facilitating small businesses.
The faster the speed that is happening, the faster the speed is to be achieved.
But the beginning has been done well.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have been given Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek himself said about his enthusiasm.
There are a lot of news coming to me too.

She's doing the parcel.
That's why she used to smoke a lot of money in the past and used to do business very hard.

I have to say more about Kerala today.
I have written a script to the students of St. Mary Primary at Kochi, Chittor, Kerala.
I have sent Bharat Mata to India in the shape of India.
I am surprised to know why they have made a picture in the shape of India with their own prints.
But I understand after reading the script that they want to give a very important symbolic message.
These girls have only made the Prime Minister aware that it is not.
Their aim is to transform the body into a profession and habit.
These girls have written to me that you must invite people on the occasion of your Mann Ki Baat-Baat in Manas.
Sudke Gurji, 80 years old Maharashtra, always continues to work.
He said that the body should be celebrated.
I have a lot of messages on the phone.
Devsh of Delhi also sent me such a message .
However, only 5 thousand organisations have been successful in this country, which is one hundred and fifty crore people.
Each year, one lakh eyes are needed.
We can reach only 25 thousand.
We can only give one place where four eyes are needed.
If there is a road accident, you can donate body parts.
There are more legitimate difficulties.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation-Noto to encourage the component.
Helpline 1800-11470 services for 24 hours are available.
Honey is called Bhanji Tha.
The joy of sacrifice is in the mantra of honey Tekten Bhanji Tha, the best description.
We have seen all of us on TV.
Today, we have celebrated the occasion of Vijaya Dharamshala on Saturday.
We have also celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
This is the first time that India is organising such a large scale road.
54 African countries and civilians.
A large number of African countries have emerged in Africa.
We will be a third of the world's population if we meet these two.
More than 25 thousand African students are studying in India for the development of mankind, Capacity Building.
Many of the people who have gone here and there are now boats in many countries in Africa.
This shows how close we have.
In this context, this meeting is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good job.
Millions of students were present on the occasion.
The people of the village have seen it.
The people know how much Mahatma Gandhi played an important role in Africa-India relations, how much Mahatma Gandhi's personality is in these two lands.
This was followed by several parlor friends.
How carefully did you do it.
In the last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana, in a series of discussions on the Adarsh Gram Yojana, including the village elders, District Collectors, Parliamentarians and all the Central and State Governments.
Unfortunately, when we come to Jharkhand, we hear all this.
Several places have been destroyed due to the intensity of the Left.
The officers encouraged the functioning.
I extend my warm greetings to Shriman Kariyamunda, Members of Parliament.
Although the archaeological archaeological archaeology is from Andhra .
Ruwala was elected to the Lok Sabha from the North-Eastern State of Mizoram.
The North-East has done a good job in electing Rawala Hilling village of Adarsh village.
Shri Ruwala Ji inaugurated the jaggery festival on 11th March in this village.
Mr. Ruvalaji congratulated the Adarsh village for fulfilling its own prosperity in the village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how will there be no proposal for cleanliness in this matter
This message was sent by a woman from Mumbai to Savitarai.
This time, on Deepavali, we will clean our homes and our traditions.
As a result, as soon as Deepavali was launched, the work on cleanliness started on its own.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form of a festival after the festival.
We have to do this in every programme.
Today, I extend my best wishes to all media institutions in the country.
On 2nd October, last year, I had the opportunity to participate in a press conference organized by India on the Swachh Bharat programme on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti.
The institute was awarded the Clean India Awards.
I salute those who have worked for Swachh Bharat in the celebrations of One Lake One Mission.
How many countries have been cleaned in our country.
I heartily compliment the India TV Group that has done so miraculously.
He also participated in 51 lakh children in about 55,56 thousand schools in the states of Andhra and Telangana.
Outside countries, railway stations, spiritual messages, hospitals, parks have been spreading on cleanliness in such areas.
Now these newspapers give us the power to realize the goals of Swachh Bharat.
Therefore, all the people of the country are now taking this step forward by considering what Smt. Satya Rai suggested.
He further said that this village has received the most clean village award of Cleanest Village in Asia.
It is heartening to know that we are far away from our country, how beautiful the Meghalaya State of the North-Eastern region has won the prizes in the field of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had made a revelation from the Red Fort.
When the poor man goes to small jobs, how many steps he has to come for recommendations, how he asks the teams to ask him, how he has come to work, however he does not get jobs, he gets money.
I have never heard in the world that how many psychologists have fully understood a person in one or two minutes interview.
I extend my best wishes to all the young friends on this occasion.
And in the following budget, I have made a face-to-face project.
Gold has become a part of our country's life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in the house .
Another thing is that you don't have gold bags in Savarin Gold Band.
But now we started it .
This is why there is no need to buy gold now.
In the coming weeks, the people of the country will come forward with this scheme that will harm the security.
I am very happy to say that we are bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why don't we have the indigenous seal of our country
Therefore, in the coming weeks, we will reach the common people before the Dhan Terracotta, and we will start the Indian gold coins with five grams and five grams of Ashoka.
Besides, 20 grams of gold mills are also coming to the public.
I assure you that this new scheme will bring about new changes in the direction of orthodoxy.
However, one mantra should be a constant medium for our thoughts, processing and individualization.
There is Victoria in India .
Several classes, women, traditions, many languages, different species, cultures.
Therefore, there is a single mantra of diversity.
Peace, harmony and integrity are divine medicines for development.
The Run for Unity has been undertaken at several places in the country on 31st October last year.
Take one mantra forward.
Now you will be in the Deepavali arrangements and you will continue to clean the houses.
New goods can be purchased.
Deepavali is being celebrated everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Deepavali.
But on the day of Deepavali, I keep listening to some news.
Therefore, I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
It is a matter of fact to study the world that many years ago, Lord Vishwaswar had done for womens empowerment.
The idol of Lord Vishwaswar on the land of London is an excellent example of inventing the idol of Lord Vishwaswar - how Indian males think far-flungly over centuries ago.
We must learn languages in a country like India.
I will also try to reach you in your language at 8 o'clock in the night.
However, there was a good relationship between us.
The last year has been completed.
Now I am going to be present in the new year.
My best wishes to my dear countrymen again.
Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat Programme (September 2015)
My dear countrymen.
Man Ki Baat - One year, many things in our minds.
I don't know what you have achieved, but I cannot tell you how much I can get.
The power of the people is very important in democracy.
I have a prior consideration in my life, with which I have immense satisfaction over the power of the people.
But I learnt through Mann Ki Baat-Mann Ki Baat, I understand, I got it, and I say that we think that the power of people is inadequate.
The people of our forefathers used to say that they are part of the fate of God.
However, millions of people used to be conscious and send me help.
It's a great power in itself.
These lakhs of excitements have taught me a great lesson.
It is a matter of fact that the information should be carried from the bottom level to the bottom level, which is actually going from top to bottom.
Someone said that this news will change in Mann Ki Baat-Mans.
But it's done.
Likewise, Mann Ki Baat has changed the need to inform us about social power.
Keeping in mind the tourism sector in India, I have urged all the citizens to send a good picture to India, inclusive India and others.
But how big aid has come.
Millions of people have sent photographs from all over the country.
There is a spectacle for the power of the people, a feeling.
Once I was talking to Mann Ki Baat-Mansu, the poor people lay in their houses and the kids cry.
It is difficult for the common man, the middle class and the lower middle class to leave the stone.
Not only from Siachen, but from Kutch region, there is no place to call Gani phones from commerce, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
Phones were done from all the places .
It is a pleasant feeling.
They sent their messages to all ages.
I liked to hear some messages myself, it's very good.
My bundle has been working on them.
This is the reason why they cannot see TV, so radio is heard.
I am aware of the importance of radio for those who are unable to see.
I am looking at the new angle, how many good things have been explained - the government is enough to make aware.
Pawan Acharya sent a message from Alwar, Rajasthan.
The soil pressures are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the occasion of hearing.
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Army, Air Force, Navy, to protect the country's land, seas and sky.
In 1965, 50 years of war with Pakistan were completed.
In this regard, a honourable visit was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
I've seen it funny.
The fighting in Hajipur was done in Gani and Chaminda, but the sights of the winds of Hajipur and Hajipur pass will be enhanced.
Charitra is connected with our heritage.
I would like to see you and your family if you are around Delhi for some more days.
Don't go to see me quickly.
I went back in two and a half hours.
A young boy ordered the Prime Minister, but the boy had forgotten to call his name quickly.
After independence, for the first time, a few hours have been discussed in the Parliament on the occasion of cleanliness.
I am seeing good in this .
It also looks forward to discussing the cleanliness of the country.
On the one hand, parlormen and on the other hand, the country's puzzles are talking about cleanliness.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi says.
Once I want to choose one of both freedom and cleanliness, I want to choose cleanliness and freedom, he added.
Gandhiji's cleanliness is more important than independence.
He wrote that Deen Dayal ji wants to know about the centenary of his birth.
On 2nd October, Mahatma Gandhi was celebrated by the revered Bapu.
5 per sum of Rs. 15 or 50 per sum of money will be paid to the chicken pox.
This joy will give you a little bit.
When I went to Kolkata in May, I met the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
Chandra Bose, son of son of his brother.
I am happy to see the family members of Subhash Babu who have had the opportunity to spend this evening.
Chandra Bose and his family members are in the process, and over 50 members of the Subhash Bose family have come to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
But it is a matter of great joy that the opportunity to host such a great personal family has never come to the Prime Minister's residence, which I am going to find in October.
This is why more than 50 members of the Subhash Babu family living in different countries are coming out.
It's not a moment that gives me happiness.
Is it safe that I have the valuable authority.
I have visited Kashi in this regard.
I met a lot of people.
Someone has met a student of Shaktij Pandey.
Something is happening in the Central Universities in Varanasi Hindu Universities.
However, in such a young age, I have seen interest in physics related matters.
Whatever he said is microscopic knowledge, but I have seen his belief and taste.
I would like to congratulate all the children of the country on scientific matters.
Sometimes there is also some joy in such things.
Sometimes our heavenly colleagues - half an hour.
But I obey your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
Now it's very easy for a month.
The Mann Ki Baat programme has become a year and you know.
You know how much Subhash Babu can use radio.
He interacted with the Vikli News Bulletin of Azad Hind Radio.
He used to run radio in all languages of English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, English, Pass.
The year has come to me while talking to us in the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat - I understand that your words in my mind have become a word in your mind.
I'm the only one, but they're yourself.
Give me your suggestions.
Your suggestions will also benefit the government.
It's brilliant.
Man Ki Baat , 2015 .
On the second time I got the opportunity to tell things in my mind .
People in the remote southern region are drowning on the occasion of Onam and celebrated the Swachh Raksha Bandhan festival across the country.
The Government of India has entered many new methods for the social Bhadrata of common people .
11 crore households have reached this scheme since the beginning of May.
I extend my best wishes to all the mothers and sisters on the occasion of the Pilgrimage Day.
Today, I have been talking to you - the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana at a bigger level.
The opportunity of youth is also available . in one year Bangkoking Rang , economy , lice .
Don't stop opening the accounts.
We have been able to get diabetes from the bank to the poor.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them anymore.
I have brought them to you and now it is your duty to buy them.
We all have to keep bank accounts alive.
I'm sure you're gonna buy.
The recent incidents and violent incidents in Gujarat have led to the movement of the entire country.
Anything happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel, the entire country is suffering and suffering.
However, in a short span of time, all the elders and my brothers and sisters of Gujarat have improved the situation.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has played a crucial role in preventing the situation.
Peace, unity and harmony is the right path.
Their words, the way they speak, is the generosity of the Sufi community, the beauty of it, and the synergy of music is hidden.
I am feeling all this to be in the midst of them.
I believe that there is a need to realise the true nature of the Mother God in the right way.
I am sure that the spirit of love and generosity in the Sufi community reaches this message from far-flung areas.
I am also telling them that we need to understand the species of Sufi.
I am fortunate to have this invitation again.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world have come to Buddha in India.
I have to participate in it and I am happy to invite them to Buddha.
The first Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, went to Buddha.
Even before this, I have mentioned this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We have issued an ordinance on earthquake.
The Ordinance is scheduled to be completed tomorrow on 31st August.
But there was a deficiency in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that we have taken this decision to move forward at a rapid pace, not just as the Ministry of Commerce, but as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
You don't need to be a victim of fearlessness.
It is normal to remember Lal Bahadur Scientist when the 1965 war came into force.
It is a common thing to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is a matter of great pleasure to recall the immortality of Indias tri-color and its pride.
Such historical incidents always inspire us.
Last week, I had a good opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi community.
I have got the opportunity to interact with the eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect Personnel to the Area
There is a need to take it forward as an opportunity.
Whatever dreams we have in their eyes, I have said in the following courses: I would like to reiterate the need for students to look forward to scientific and how many opportunities are there and I would like to reiterate it again.
Especially to my young friends.
Everybody is running . This can also be the reason of water in the lower level .
The decision to liberate small jobs from inter-sectoral levels is now almost in force.
This is the first time in the country outside the United States.
Today, about 50 thousand pregnant women and 13 lakh babies in our country die at the time of delivery or at the time of delivery.
If we get rid of polio, we can also get rid of tetanus and infant mortality.
There are reports about dengue.
We don't make death so easy.
How priceless life is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, observation of hygiene, which are the causes of death, it is not correct.
514 centres across the country have free dengue determination tests.
Now we cannot get the opportunity to return to the country but we cannot get the opportunity to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced India's pride.
Sometimes, due to lack of awareness, we are unjust to our youth.
I believe that this agreement has been going on for centuries.
My experience is different from the youth.
Sometimes, whenever you talk to the youngsters, there is a chance to learn from them.
It is said that 'Sande on Cycle' is faster.
Some say that we are playing a cycle day in a week.
Man Ki Bath , June 2019 .
O my dear countrymen , Namaskar .
Sometimes we were inspiring us .
How can you imagine how can I spend time in this middle .
On Sunday , last Sunday I felt as if I had lost something at 11 o'clock .
It feels sure .
Perhaps this is not a permanent program .
In this program there was life , it seems that the heart was luxurious , that is why I felt very difficult to come to this program .
But this sunset has been very waiting .
In the last few months, many messages have come and people have also been missing Mann Ki Baat.
I would be very good when I read them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in so many acquaintances .
Your hustle-bustle can be done .
I also want to share those feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat changes.
In how many acquaintances , in the contribution of Jaypajayal , even more polio I am Baaldera .
Many people were discovered in it .
It's a chance I spent with me, for my sake.
Now I can tell you that the small break in the line of Mann Ki Baat has created a chance to fill the solitary cave in the Kedar valley.
Besides this I also try to fulfil your complications one day .
When I am not able to say but I definitely do .
Because you have that right on me .
In the matter of Kedar how people have seen roaring in the same way , with some positive things , I have seen many times in your words .
Sometimes the work of paying attention to my thoughts also keep on talking to you .
People , with bringing problems related to the country , society , with bringing them in my sight they also tell their results .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then efforts are also exhibiting their wrath towards pollution .
That is , how the results of problems are seen in your words in the society of society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a price for society.
It is known by this that there is no deficiency of energy , strength , talent situated in the country .
There is a need to work with those strengths and talents and give them an opportunity to work.
This Mann Ki Baat is another thing that 130 crore people want to participate actively in the development of the country.
When I analyzed such things, you can imagine how much energy I am getting.
I didn't really come, you brought me, sat down, you gave me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, we will take the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was an attack in the mind of all people .
Therefore apart from its own country , apart from its self-confidence the country has invited how many acquaintances for preservation .
Perhaps in any country of the world there people have seen such a number of such a country in 77 -LRB- 77 -RRB- without taking their rest , authority , authority , necessity for democracy .
Today, the solidarity of democracy, the greatest number of gardens in our country, from wealth to beaches, all participated in this festival and participated in deciding the future of our country.
When something happens to us, we underestimate it, we also ignore its implications.
This number may seem normal to us, but if we leave China in the world, it can be said that more than any country of the rest of the world has now been driven.
The number of people in 2019 is more than the total population of America , approximately twice .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is so many acquaintances of the world in history .
In this way you can imagine how big level of human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible only if lakhs of students , rulers , workers work day and night .
About three lakh Paramilitary Teams of Defence Forces have taken their responsibilities and 20 lakh police personnel from different states have also been suffering at a critical level to fulfil this great mission of democracy.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done .
You can imagine about 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines.
It has been done that no Ooty should not be used in its Ooty .
A police station has been set up for only one woman Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh .
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place in the world is located in India .
This is located at a height of 15000 feet in the Lahaul - Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh .
Not only this , there is also another chance of this pride .
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also participated in the Ooting with enthusiasm as compared to men.
The quantity of polio is approximately equal to women , men .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that in parlor today 78 -LRB- 78 -RRB- women are epilepsy .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me saying Boke not Book.
In welcome - welcome we prayed to give books instead of flowers .
Approximately at many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, I gave a book "Prem Chand Ki Lok Priya Kahania".
It gave me good .
If I did not get much time , while staying in the delivery I got the opportunity to read many stories again .
Their stories reflect the feelings of India.
When he reads the story of 'Nasa', he turned my attention towards the economic inequalities of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in the churches .
I know that Ishwari, the son of Jamindar, the valor of the poor family, is not aware of this story.
The second legend Id Gah, the heart of a child, his love for his mother, his fulfilment at the younger age.
Taking 4 . years from Hamid Sanctuary to my mother , actually human heart is considered hot .
The last part of this story is not able to do how much emotional , small Hamid parlor playing Hamid parlor - old Amina , Amina has become a small sin .
Likewise, Puss Ki Rath is a miraculous story.
In this story a painting of a poor life is seen .
If his fruit is destroyed then it is not necessary to sleep in the winters of Haldu Ratu in the winters of bowing .
Actually these stories are old for a century , today it seems appropriate to be sufficient .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If you talk about reading , in some media I read about the Akshay Library of Kerala .
If this library is in a village of dense forests of Idukki -LRB- Idukki -RRB- then you will not be surprised .
The first school teacher there was P . .
K.
Both of these small children have been polluted regularly for this library .
Once the books had to be taken on the shoulders of the books .
Today this library is showing everybody along with children .
Gujarat (South Gujarat) is a successful use of the garden in Gujarat.
In lakhs of people of all ages participate in this garden .
You must write about the book reading in the Narendra Modi App, so that everyone in Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
I am very happy to note that my dear countrymen, the people of our country will not only think of the present but also of the future as a challenge.
When I read your descriptions in the Narendra Modi App, in my televisions, many people are writing about the problem of water.
In Belgavi, Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related problems.
Water is very important in our culture .
It is said about the water of hypnotise in Rig Veda . Heshta Mao Bhubaneswar , Sthatna , Maharnaya Sakshayya , Shiva juice , late Bhajayatta , Ushtiva meaning water is the energy of life .
In many places of the country water problems are lifting up .
In the water of rainy season along with the year we can hide only 8  water that you are not surprised .
Only 8 percent .
The time has to be discovered for this problem .
Like all the rest of the problems , with the participation of people , with the capacity of hundred and fifty crore people , with the help of the capacity of the country , with the help of this problem .
The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been organised in the country, especially considering the importance of water.
Through this you can take decisions in all the matters related to water .
I did a new work of some people .
All the surprising villages of the country have written Uttaranchal .
To collect water from the villagers , to collect water , to collect every drop of rain water , to make them a collection in the village , to discuss with the villagers .
In this work the whole week participated with enthusiasm in this month 22 thousands of people were suffering in Panchayatti .
People in the villages have promised every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I will listen to you a sarpanch.
My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, the Lung Panchayat Sarpanch of Kattam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand.
The people there were ready to play their part for water conservation once again .
Everybody has many luxuries for their activities , everybody .
People of the village , their swimming water temple seems to be competitioning .
I see positive consequences like that , social attempts .
There is no one farm for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore in various places of the country , efforts are being made in different ways .
Therefore the problem of water logging is removed .
There was a big change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan.
20,000 women have collectively tried to revive the Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that in Garhwal, all the women are working immensely on rain water harvesting.
I believe that this kind of efforts are being made to make it impossible even if we all try together.
My first hearing, how did the people of the country promote cleanliness, as well as for water conservation, we also started a preservation.
I am confident that all of us are committed to supplementing every drop of water and the prasad of water Parmeshwar.
To save one drop of water we made a garden .
Talk about the problems of water , talk about water conservation methods .
I am particularly requested to lead innovative capabilities for water conservation for the major areas of different regions.
Leave films , do not give sports , do not give our friends of media , let people of social institutions , let people of cultural institutions , let everybody take the leadership of this park in their own way .
Awake the society , work together with society .
See , before our eyes we definitely see changes .
I am listening to all of you that the traditional methods of water conservation have to be shared.
If there is a chance to visit Porbandar, Pooja Bapu's birthplace, there is a house behind the worshipped Bapu's house where 200 water tanks are available.
Therefore, I have always been telling you that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then you must see that water tank.
Come , we have encouraged the water conservation by making maximum methods related to water conservation .
You can share your content using the HanShakti4alShakti Hash Tag.
Agreement for Holistic Health Care has increased, which has increased the importance of Yoga Day.
During the sunrise in all the corners of the world yoga is welcomed , sunset happens .
Where man is yoga .
The Indian Ocean from the Himalayas of India , Siachen , Siachen , Sab Marine Varuku , Air-Fore , Air-craft carriages , AC gyms , the desert of the villages , where there is a chance of yoga , not only has been done .
I have been shown in the Twitter on how the leaders of several countries, Prime Ministers, well-known people, ordinary citizens have performed Yoga in their countries.
On that day the whole world looked like a happy family .
Therefore the propagation of yoga is a great society .
Do not pay attention to this service .
I am very happy to announce the Prime Ministers Awards to those who have played a special role in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019.
This award has been given to many institutions across the world and you cannot imagine how important it has played in spreading Yoga.
For example, if Japan is taking Yoga Niketan, it has popularized Yoga all over Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several instruments and training courses.
Then Ms. of Italy.
Antonietta Roy, a person, started the Sarvoyog International and propagated Yoga all over Europe.
All these are spectacular .
In the matter of yoga the Indians are not able to go back to yoga .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalayas, Munger have also received this award and it has been dedicated to Yoga for the past few decades.
Both the awards for the extensive celebrations of Yoga and the contribution of Yoga to the homeland have made this Yoga Day even more important.
My dear countrymen, our journey starts today, new feelings, new feelings, new opportunities, new capabilities.
Although I am waiting for your advice .
I have a major journey to walk with your thoughts and Mann Ki Baat is only for me.
Come , we are meeting , talking .
Leave your feelings , listening , understanding .
Sometimes try to live according to those feelings .
Let your blessings always be on me .
You are my inspiration , you are my strength .
Let us enjoy Mann Ki Baat while sitting together and enjoying the work of life.
Once again, I will meet in Mann Ki Baat in the coming month.
Thank you all .
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
If the mind starts starting Manki Bath then the mind is heavy .
Ten days Christian Bharat had lost his sons .
These people of paragliding have lost their lives for the protection of 125 crores of our country .
For the people of the country to sleep peacefully these virgins saved us from their sleep .
Our adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous games are always present .
Ram Niranjan, father of Ratan Thakur, Amarvir of Baghalpur, Bihar, gives us inspiration to all of us in such sad moments.
It is said that he also sends his second son to fight with enemies , if necessary he would also fight .
On seeing the courage of the wife of Sahu 's wife of Jagatsinghpur of Orissa the country of Yavat is bowing to her .
This small entertainment is that every small child of India tells everything .
Such feelings , we are seen in the houses of our virgins , Parakrama , Amravati .
Their families also have nomination in it .
The Amar of Deoria , the family of Vijay Maurya , the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra , the son of Hemraj of the fort , the son of six , the story of every family of these martyrs is full of inspiration .
I am trying to understand the feelings exhibited by these families , to understand the feelings exhibited .
Living literature in front of our eyes is an inspirational example of the future of India .
O my dear countrymen , independence , we are waiting for the memorial of war .
I am surprised that there is no memorial of national war in India .
There is a memorial of conserving the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I decided to make such a memorial in the country .
It is very happy to fulfil this construction in a very short time to build a national war memorial .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , our crores of the country were entrusted to the army of this national soldiers .
This is a small attempt to fulfil the country .
In the heart of Delhi , i . . in Delhi where India Gate , Amarvir Jyoti has been built near them .
I believe that visiting this national soldiers memorial is equal to visiting a pilgrimage to the people of the country .
After the independence of the country this national soldiers were a symbol of thanksgiving thanksgiving the country for the country .
The shape of this memorial , exhibits the unparalleled courage of our martyrs .
The National Military Memorial is based on four central circulars and in the first circular, the entire journey from birth to sacrifice has been painted.
The jewellery of Amar Chakra is a symbol of Amarvir .
The second circular chakra .

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018

The journey of this Mann Ki Baat Dharawahi is fulfilling fifty bags with this .
That is why this is the Golden Jubilee Episode, that is, the Golden Festival of Mann Ki Baat.
This time all the phones coming from all of you have also proposed the contribution of this golden year .
Ansh Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Vikas Yadav from Patna in Mai Gau
It is said that people ask you that the technology of technology of technology , social media , mobile ypsy is said to be the person of mobile yps .
But why have you chosen radio through the medium of meeting people
Let me tell you a story.
This is in 1998 .
I was working as an institutional member of the Indian Janta Party in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of ' India ' is the cost of bombs .
I do not mean .
Sometimes it is said that as soon as you listen to radio , the same thing has been discussed in radio .
When our Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee came forward and told the media that the test was done on that day, how much the tea smile was heard in the radio.
Radio was estimated by estimating the energy .
After becoming the prime minister it is natural to repeat my vision towards the most powerful medium .
The feedback coming in this survey is very interesting .
How extensive church has also been done about puja .
This is a good example of the point of view of social , positive emotional emotions situated in the mind of all the people of our country .
Some people have also shared their experiences by the program of Mann Ki Baat i . . voluntaryism i . . hygiene service .
People are coming forward at a big height for the service of the society and this is a transformation.
I am very happy to change radio more favorite for people due to the program of Manki Bath .
The north , online expansive expansive expansions , phones , all these are clearly visible .
Modi comes, goes, but this country remains stable and our culture remains forever.
All these small stories of 130 crore people of the country remain alive .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks .
My experiences also participate with water .
After that gradually this thing turns towards a change while buying houses , social meditation , water sports .
Sometimes, the Prime Minister in the phone calls also has the privilege of providing the country to his households.
How can the government get the power to gain from the small village of Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad
Many times Mann Ki Baat has also become a victim of ridicule but in my mind all the people of 130 crore people of the country are always there.
All of them are my mind .
Man Ki Baat is not the word of the government , this is the word of society .
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, the word of a renowned India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest gloriousness of the eleventh man K . . is that apart from a prime minister you ask a nearby man i . . this is the same .
If you want to say peace easily to your question then there is nothing to be made .
Actually Man Ki Baat is a very easy task for me .
Every time the answers of people come in front of Manki Bath .
People share their ideas in MyGou, Narendra Modi Mobile Apps and a toll free number is 1800117800.
People who phoned this number record their message with their throats .
Before the start of Manki Bath my attempt is to read more north , more expansive expansively .
I hear a lot of phone calls myself.
Do not fall near the Mann Ki Baat program , while traveling I read how much of your thoughts , inputs I read .
Every moment, all the people of my country are in my mind, therefore, those who read the north, those who read the north, their emotions, their emotions are part of my thoughts.
This north is not only a piece of cave .
Actually things meaning the name of the person , name of the person etc . is done by mouth .
I express my gratitude to everyone participating in the Mann Ki Baat, for example, emotions and enthusiasm.
Without reading their northern , expansive expansions the number of those who send northern , wildlife is in lakhs .
I am also trying to bring out the unprecedented answers and information related departments in the Mann Ki Baat.
Radio , Doordarshan , T . . . Chhanals , social meditations are also thanks to all my colleagues .
Because of their hardship most of the people can reach Manki Bath .
All the programs of the skywani Vrindavan Vrindavan are published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to the voice near the throat in the regional languages , with the same voice .
In such a way they are turning into Nrandra Modi for thirty minutes .
You all have to listen to the program of Mann Ki Baat in your language .
It is considered that everybody has done less coverage -LRB- virtue -RRB- about them , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeology .
But the media has converted many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat into their own things.
The media has worked forward by giving a new way to many things like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, selfie with dugter etc.
If you do not have your support then my journey of this Mann Ki Baat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much for your phone call, Garu.
If you want to tell the truth then I have no secret .
Old things of our own life do not stop us , it is easy to understand anyone before us .
Sometimes our bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's bird 's
It is my first priority to understand anything instead of confessing , not confessing , instead of every activity .
I am trying to talk to various programs or social meditations .
I am trying to understand that they do , thinking .
It is very good to question the youth .
They're in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our surroundings , social entrepreneurship , startups , sports or other kinds of changes in society .
The courage to question , to make big dreams adventurous .
If we bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, give freedom to express them, they can bring about social changes in the country, they are also doing so.
My dear countrymen, I don't want to talk about the Statehood Day of Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
It is said that today is very special , because we are asking the state to be asked in the twenty five years of this day .
Blessed are many blessed for your information .
All these great princes gave us such an expansive , expansive state .
With an extraordinary speed these are also an example of Time management cool , procedure .
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities during the record .
It is the confluence of the greatest participants of the country that the people of the country have to be empowered and everybody has been tied to provide a empowered state.
The responsibility of Hakulu has been described in detail in our state and the speciality of our state.
In the life of the country both of these conveniences take the country forward .
In 2010, when the State of India completed 60 years, we roamed the book of State on elephants in Gujarat.
To increase the best position of the state in youth , to introduce them a memory of the state which is an attempt to introduce them .
In the year 2020, we complete fifty years in the form of a Ganesha. In 2022 we will come to our freedom and complete fifty five.
My dear countrymen, if we talk about the Rajya Sabha then it is unforgettable with the roots of the princely state that stands at the centre of the Rajya Sabha.
It is said that the preservation of India has not come from outside .
What is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
India Fort : This is the root mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the priests of Babasaheb , Ambedakar , the listener of the listener .
Guru Nanak Dev had always been associated with the category of the people .
He has always seen the way of truth , Karma , service , compassion , self-confidence .
In the coming year, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev is celebrated in the country and the joy of these festivals spreads not only in the country but all over the world.
All the states , central governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival .
Similarly the 550th Jayanti festival of Guru Nanak is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak .
I remembered Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara when I participated in a meeting related to this.
Because of the earthquake coming in 2001 the Gurudwara was also heavy injury .
But along with the state government , local people the shore of that Gurudwara again stands an example of this .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that tourists of our country can easily see the holy place of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , we moved this journey further .
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31th October the beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birthplace of all of us .
Like every year on that day also the youth of the country are ready to participate in the ' Run ' running for unity .
Now the weather is also pleasant .
All of you are also privileging to participate in the 'Run for Unity' race for unity.
Six and a half months before independence, on 27 January, 1947, the world famous international essay 'Tam Magazine' published an essay, published a picture of Sardar Patel on the paper cover journal.
In their Leed Street this journalist has given an India .
But it is not like India watching this .
It is a part of India divided into many parts .
There were approximately 550 countries in the country .
The interest of the British towards India decreased but they wanted to go to India by pieces of India .
Time magazine has also discovered other storeys of human life in its exercise .
In 1920, how he had organised help programmes in floods in Ahmedabad, how he had guided Bardoli Satyagraha.
After discovering one problem of Sardar Patel , it has been seen that it is impossible to fulfil the country .
We remind that all this India tied with the support of unity , seeing our India , we remind us directly of Sardar Bhai Patel .
This statue established on the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the height of the US Statue of Liberty.
This is the biggest statue of the world .
Every Indian is now proud of the highest statue of the world .
Not only this , Sardar Patel tied with the earth is now also increasing the glimpse of the sky .
It is natural to see this idol of every Indian .
It is my belief that people of every corner of India consider this statue as the most favourite museum.
My beloved brothers and sisters , all our countrymen have celebrated ' Infantry Day ' .
I salute all those who are part of the Indian army .
I am also selecting the families of our soldiers for their adventure .
But you know why all our countrymen celebrate this 'Infantry Day'
On this day our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir from the chariots asked on the grass of Kashmir .
This historical incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
I read the old interval of Taluku -LRB- conversation -RRB- of an important Indian Army Summit .
In that conversation Field Marshal Samnekshaw reminded him of the days when he was calculated.
At that time in October 1947 soldiers started in Kashmir .
It is delayed to send the army of Kashmir to Kashmir that in one conclusion Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had reminded that in this conclusion Sardar Patel had not been able to see the soldiers of Kashmir in his own way .
My dear countrymen , playing games do not like anyone .
Sports , strength , skill , capacity - all these are important in the world .
These are the guides of a player successfully .
How important are these four properties for the construction of any country .
All these qualities are in the youth of the country , not only in economic , science , technology but also in playing games .
It is said that I had done two times .
First, there was an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
In these sports, our Para Athletes created the record by conducting a total of 72 ranks of India have enhanced the pride of India.
Para Athletes have got the privilege of meeting themselves.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to meet the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Argentina.
You are happy to know that in Youth Olympics 2018, our youth is exhibiting their talent above all.
In these competitions, our country has won three seconds in addition to thirty-four stakeholders.
This time in Asia Cricket also our country keeps in mind all of you .
In some minutes I see how many times this is the best , it is more important , like that .
India is not only in the field of sports but also in the field of imagination.
In order to lead a life from the orphanage, he did the work of cleaning the DTC buses, in Dhabal, on the roadside of Delhi.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , India is spending golden palanquins .
Not only this , see the capacity to increase in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympics in Judo, Sinior Level and Junior Level.
But in Youth Olympics Tababi Devi has created history of silver .
The youth player Tababi Devi lives in a village of Manipur .
If the father goes to the cool breeze , then the mother sold fish .
Many times there were no money for food in their house .
In such situations also the courage of Tababi Devi is not less .
History has created history for the country .
Every youngster, he recognizes the spirit of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember that we have successfully organized the FIFA Under17 World Cup in 2017.
The most successful tournament has given the world of Yavat .
We also created a new agreement on the number of viewers in the FIFA Under17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh visitors from the stadiums of different places of the country have encouraged the youth sports by seeing those football competitions .
This year, India has got the privilege of hockey World Cup 2018 at Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts from 28 November to 16 December .
There is definitely interest in any kind of sports playing Indian or some sports .
There is a golden sports of India in Haki game .
Yavat world knows about the meditation of Haki Maternity Message .
After that Balvindar Singh Sinior , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahid , Udham Singh decided a very big journey from Dhanraj Singh .
Today our team India players are giving inspiration to new generations with their industry , victory over their industry .
To see inspired competitions is a good opportunity for players .
You must go to Bhubaneswar to see Haki matches and encourage our players .
My dear countrymen, many people are coming forward to organise social programmes and they are also inspiring to all the people of the country.
Our tradition that came from thousands of centuries we can see this heritage at every place in the society .
But in this new age , new generations have come forward to do this work with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'Self-4 society'. My portal was launched to provide them the right opportunities to the IT and electronic entrepreneurs of the country to motivate their employees to perform social programmes.
All Indians are proud to see the enthusiasm and reverence that they have seen for organizing this program.
The journey from IT to society , I am not, we are not adult, we are in it to walk satisfactory from self.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some people pay attention to cleanliness , some rails are helping .
There is no self-sufficiency behind all these , only the feeling of dedication, self-sufficiency and self-sufficiency.
A young man learned the wheelchair basketball to help the hair of Divangs.
Mission mode activity means this zeal , this is the dedication feeling .
Definitely pride .
The feeling that we are not me, inspires all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time I have seen an interesting description from Pondicherry for the Mann Ki Baat.
In My Gau, he says, "You should say in the Mann Ki Baat programme in a very important example of Indian tribal traditions, ideals, nature and partnership."
Mansh Garu , this thing is impossible for proclaiming you before Manki Bath .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to see our glorious culture, the past, which is being celebrated to protect the environment of the youth world, especially the western countries.
Our India also faces this problem .
For the result of this, we have to look at our history and contacts once again.
Especially we should know the lifestyle of our tribal lifestyle . It is in our tribal culture .
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
In the middle of India , especially in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region the tribals of Bhil dynasty , Arjun trees are worshipped .
In the desert area like Rajasthan they have seen how to conserve environment .
Especially in the matter of conservation of trees they are ready to sacrifice their lives but one tree does not let harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
The tigers are considered to be their brethren .
In Nagaland also tigers are taken as protectors of forests .
In the Bridging Season, the Gonda segment of India stops fishing at some places of the Kethan river.
The tribals build their homes with natural products, which are stronger and better for transportation.
In south India a small category of smoke living in the solitary areas of Nilgiri Peeth is made of small things found in the traditional places .
It is true that my beloved brothers and sisters, the tribals believe that they will live peacefully and peacefully but they are not afraid to fight for their own hiccups.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we are telling people, institutions who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , that work has a very deep effect .
A few days ago I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab .
A simple rail Gurubachan Singh has been married to work hard .
Before this marriage Gurubachan had married the marriage of the parents of the parents , but my marriage was done .
But all of you will be surprised to hear a common night, brother, Gurubachan, who is a true strength in our society.
Shri Gurubachan Singh had kept an example of such a family in front of us .
I read about another small village Kallar Majra near Nabha of Punjab .
Why did this village of Kallar Majra come to the church , instead of burning the rest of the cereals in the field , they are covered inside the soil , for which all the technology is necessary .
Brother Gurubachan Singh is my best wishes .
To keep the atmosphere clean for the people of Kallar Majra , to keep the environment clean .
You are walking ahead in the reality of the Indian tradition .
On occurrence of drops , drops , small precautions , good tasks , social tasks , always play a very big role in making the environment .
In life , in the heart , in me , in thee , in every part of the world , peace is established everywhere .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first World War of November 11 was completed .
The war was completed after the end of the war , when the heavy loss occurred , the loss of the people completed a century .
First World War is a major incident of India .
If you want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
Even then our soldiers fought with so much virtue , how big role were played , gave maximum sacrifices .
When the war came then Indian soldiers had seen the world to take anyone .
In rare places , in poisonous conditions also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The only objective behind all these is to establish peace again.
The World War I saw the destruction of the world.
According to the estimates approximately one crore soldiers , other crore people lost their lives .
Therefore peace is so important that the world knows .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
This is peace , harmony meaning not only war .
From rapidity to change in the environment , economic development social judgment has to be changed .
The real signal of peace is the true signal of the development of the person .
My beloved country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is unparalleled and the people here are the most reflective .
This award given for the best polygraphy in this hole is equal to the oscar in that hole.
Apart from this we spent this archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeology .
Therefore I am telling many opinions to the people of Sikkim .
My beloved country has become October .
There are many changes in the environment also .
Along with this the environment of festivals has also come . Dhanan curtain , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat , Chhat . in one way the month of November .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many luxuries .
I would like to all of you to keep in mind your health as well as your health in these festivals.
These festivals also give opportunity to make new decisions .
With a mission mode, I would like to change these festivals as an opportunity for you to move forward in life.
Your growth in the development of the country is a major part .
If you have developed so much then the country will be able to progress .
All of you are my many luxuries .
