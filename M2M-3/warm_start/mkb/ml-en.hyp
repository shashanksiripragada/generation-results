Mann Ki Baat October, 2019
My dear countrymen, salute you.
Today is the holy day of Deepawali.
Nowadays Deepawali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The speciality of this festival is that not only the Indian community, but also the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations there celebrate with the joy and joy of Diwali.
This is how a micro world of India is showing.
Friends, Tourism Festival related to celebrations in the world has its own attraction for tourism.
Every region in our country has its own variety of festivals and people from other countries are particularly interested in them.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear people, we have decided in Mann Ki Baat to do something different for this Diwali.
I said, Come together, let us celebrate Deepawali this time, India's women's strength and its achievements, that is, let us respect Lakshmi of India.
Look, innumerable inspirational stories appeared in the society soon.
Written on the Namo App, the corpse of Wangal, my mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took over the responsibility of five children.
Today we are working with five brothers.
My best wishes to your mother.
Geetika Swami, an Actor in 1990, says that she is the daughter of bus conductor, Major Kushboo Conver Bharat Laxmi, headed by Assam Rifles man-viman section.
Their daughter Bharat Laxmi and her own strength are the poets.
They have great pride in their daughters being the best painter.
The girl got a good ring in the CAT examination.
A 92-year-old man who has been providing free drinking water to Gwalior Railway Station for years is also writing Meghah Jin.
Meghalaya, the glory and compassion of this Bharat Lakshmi is very inspiring.
Many such stories were shared by people.
You must read, inspire you to share things with you...
The feeling of that poetry gives us a sense that the words of that poem have been written in the seventeenth century.
How terrible words, how terrible theory, how terrible is this poem in Kannada language
The king of the mountain Himalayan Himavad was Jasulidanu, the people of Pindida Parmagonda and Himavatan, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni and his daughter Laxmi, the king of the people gained fame because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
The glory of these daughters is that our society has a strong personality and a bright future.
Ladies and gentlemen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I have never forgotten that I went to the gurudwaras of Vancoor and Tehran.
I understand a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will need several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stands firmer than many evils like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji's message reached a distance from the world.
He was the most traveller at that time.
Going to many places, all his liberality and humiliation and the behavior of the common man has turned the minds of everyone.
The great religious journeys of Guru Nanak Dev ji are said to be generous.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, the south, the east and the west, and looked at people and saints and sages everywhere.
It is believed that the well-known saint Shankar Dev of Assam is inspiring from him.
He went to the pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya related to Buddhism.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water during his visit to Beedar in Karnataka.
There is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a journey like this, Guru Nanak ji traveled in north India in Kashmir and surroundings.
This led to a strong link between the Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and the people there considered him a Guru.
He was worshipped in Uzbekistan.
He has visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He embraced the minds of millions of people, according to his suggestions, he is still following.
A few days ago, diplomats from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and celebrated the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, these strategic delegates also have the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
After that, many ambassadors shared the pictures in the community and wrote a lot of pride and pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will be remembered on 31st October.
On that day, the melting man of India is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Sardar Patel was surprisingly capable of uniting the people, and was fighting with ethically disciplined people.
Sardar Patel had deeply seen and learned everything small.
He was a personality of analysis in the true sense.
In addition to this, the institutional capabilities were also excellent.
He had the privilege of making plans and enhancing the strategies.
When Sardar Saheb reads and listens about his functioning style, he understands how deep his preparation was.
In 1921, thousands of people from all over the country came to attend the Congress General Assembly in Ahmedabad.
Patel ji had the responsibility to make all the arrangements related to the Mahasammelan.
He added this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
Nobody's gonna have a problem with water.
He told the farmers to make Khadi bags.
The farmers made the bag and sold it to the delegates.
Representatives don't want to get rid of shoes because they keep shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, there was a lot of increase in Khadi sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constituent Assembly.
He said that the importance of ensuring basic rights is that there is no possibility of any difference between caste and motherland.
Friends, We know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Bhagirathi tried to unite the nations and made the right to reduce history.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to keep an eye on everyone.
As soon as the partition of India took place in 1947, the eyes of our neighbours fell on the Lakshadweep and they shipped it with the flag of that country.
As soon as Sardar Patel was careful about this, he started a drastic action.
He urged the brothers of Arkot Ramswamy, Arkot, Laxmanswamy and others from Triple Tagore to reach Lakshadweep and to flag the Triple Tagore first.
Immediately, the tricolor was hoisted there, and the neighbour's dream of handing over the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel urged brothers to ensure that all the help required for the development of Lakshadweep is available.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will also visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
Ladies and gentlemen, on October 31, 2018, I dedicated to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the highest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America has doubled.
The world's highest statue is proud of all Indians.
The heads of all Indians rise proudly.
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists coming to the Statue of Unity within a year.
I am confident that the people there have started farming of dragon fruits, which will change the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
We are witness to how a place has emerged as a world-renowned tourist destination within a year.
People from all over the country and abroad come there.
Several arrangements are developing automatically after one another, including travel facilities, accommodation, guides, environment friendly arrangements.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, The last day Time Magazine will be an Indian who is not proud of the fact that the Statue of Unity has given a great place in the world's 100 greatest tourist destinations.
I hope you're going to see the Statue of Unity from your precious time.
However, every Indian who finds time for travel has to go to at least 15 tourist destinations and my request is to stay at night wherever he goes.
Friends, As you know, we celebrate the National Integration Day every year from 2014 to 31st October.
On this day, we advise us to save our country's unity, integration and security at all costs.
On 31st October, the Run For Unity will be organised every time.
It will be attended by people from all sections of the society and from all walks of life.
It is a symbol of this country being a run-for unity, going to the same direction and achieving the same goal.
Similarly, there is a special interest and excitement in the matter of mortality among the people.
Run phone unit is also a beautiful opportunity for it.
Running is beneficial for mind and mind and body.
Therefore, not only the body, but also the unity of the mind and cultural India, and to bring India to new heights...
So, you can find out where you live in any city, where you're going to run for unity.
I hope you will also run your fitness on 31st October for the unity of India.
Ladies and gentlemen, Sardar Patel embraced the river of unity in the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around, we can see many examples of our constant efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
But many times the problems of the society, its contributions and the rapid disappearance of memory are regular.
How many people in different ways went to the ground.
What kind of opportunists were playing games to gain from the environment in their own way.
What kind of language have you spoken to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to spread irritation in different voices.
We recall what some speakers and some vacancies said to make themselves important and what they said about negative things.
Honoured the honour of the court, the atmosphere of warming up the society and stress was not allowed to be formed anywhere.
These things have to be remembered and it gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of action.
This is an example of the sound of unity that gives the country the greatest strength.
It was a major blow to the country.
I pay homage to that gentleman today.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you hear a far-reaching story of every village, it is about cleanliness if you hear a story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, every corner of India.
It inspires every person, every family, every village to have a comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort for cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
Its consequences are only 125 crore Indians.
But it's a comfortable and attractive experience.
I'm listening to you.
The world's largest battlefield, at least 50-60 degree mine.
There's only one place for oxygen in the air.
In an opposite environment, living in the midst of such challenges is a great adventurous thing.
In the opposite atmosphere, our brave soldiers are not only looking at our borders, but also performing a Swachh Siachen.
We know these Siachen icefields are the source of rivers and water.
Therefore, the Swachhta Abhiyan here means ensuring clean water for those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
Ladies and gentlemen, Festival is an opportunity to wake up our consciousness.
If Deepawali, especially buy something new and bring something from the market is going on at least in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get ourselves in our village, we don't have to go to Taluk.
I don't need to go to the district if you're in the tall.
As we try to buy local goods, Gandhi himself will become a great opportunity for 150.
We have to buy something that our friends have dressed with the hands of our neighbours.
I urge you to buy local goods with the best wishes of Deepawali.
Look, how much we can play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes because of carelessness, it's burning.
There may be blisters.
I urge you to control yourself and celebrate the festival with zeal.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
No Indian will be proud of our armed forces.
Each Indian is always excited to express his joy and support to our soldiers, whether in any region or in any caste or community or in any language.
Yesterday, 125 crore people of India celebrated the day of our Army's bravery with pride.
We recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who showed arrogance of war on the edge of terrorism to our nation.
Our Armed Forces Exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country, with the idea that more and more citizens of the country, especially youngsters, are our strengths.
How we are capable and how our soldiers save the people by paying their lives.
On the day of Parakram Parv, the youngsters recall the proud traditions of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integration of the country.
I also attended a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of the heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who are trying to create an atmosphere of peace in our country.
India always stands with commitment and dedication for peace.
In the twentieth century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed great sacrifices for peace in the two world wars.
We have to remember that there was no connection with that war.
It was in the tradition that our soldiers showed for peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest deploying forces in several peacekeeping forces of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have been playing a vital role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmet for decades.
My dear people, the sky is different.
On October 8, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force personnel and their families who have served for the country.
When the invaders from Pakistan started a sudden attack in 1947, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and war instruments reach the battlefield at the right time to save Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
Nobody knows about the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1971.
The role of the Air Force in liberating Cargil from the grip of those who crossed Cargil in 1999 is sustainable.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force bombed the enemies at the camps.
I am grateful to the Air Force for their commendable work done by our Air Force personnel, whether it is a rescue mission to prevent accidents or accidents.
India can be proud to say that not only in the armed forces, but also in women's strength.
How can Tommy be saved
You know Ablash Tommy is a very brave hero.
He is the first Indian to be worldwide with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
For the last 80 days, he continued his journey on the ocean to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible ocean catastrophe caused him alarm.
But this hero of the Indian Navy has been fighting in the ocean for several days.
He's in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
I'm not ready to persuade you to fail.
I spoke on telephone when I saved Abhilash from the ocean, a marvellous manifestation of courage, determination and superstition.
His courage, valour, determination, the power to fight and succeed will certainly inspire the youth of our country.
Dear people, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
There is a greater significance on 2nd October this year.
From now on, for two years, we are going to organise a variety of programmes across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the whole world.
In 1945, when he empowered the freedom struggle, he reiterated the ideas and prepared a new essay.
His thoughts are in front of the people regarding the rights of revered Bapu farmers, villages and workers, and many issues such as sanitation, education, etc.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
The revered father was a mass organiser.
Dad's specificity of collaborating and collaborating with the people was his nature.
This is an experience for everyone as the most important feature of his personality.
He explained to every person that he was the most important and always needed person in the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a massive nation.
The people of all sections of the society were dedicated to themselves in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle.
Gandhiji said, I am giving you a mantra.
And you'll feel that you're undoubtedly, that's without ego.
My dear people, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, there is a need to think about the growing middle class in the country, on the basis of their growing economic strength and increasing purchase capability.
Can we remember the revered father for a while when we're going to buy something
Can you remember the mantra of the priest's father
Can you imagine which citizen of the country gets benefit from what I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who will be directly or indirectly beneficial if you buy it
I am more happy if the poorest of the poor gets the benefit.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji, and I am confident that a small step in the life of the poorest and weakest person will make a big change.
My dear people, if Gandhiji had said that if the campus was cleaned then he would not have known how it was.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, we can see how our country is playing a bigger role in empowering our country to fight against poverty in economic empowerment.
But if I believe it can be done then it will be the real patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur had also kept Khadi's old and rotten clothes because somebody's hiding in it.
He used to say that these khadi cloths are very modern and every shoe should be used.
This feeling of tea for the country and love for the people of the country was filled with a small, lengthy magnificent piece.
In two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists along with Puja Baba.
As soon as scientific name comes, the Indians will be brilliantly respected.
His glorious personality is always proud of the people.
Besides, he looked very desperate, but he had a stable personality like a mountain.
His magnificence, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, demonstrates his unique personality.
He gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the height of success during the narrow regime of nearly one and a half years as a reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation.
People from all walks of life all over the country are associated with this 15th anniversary.
If you don't have a phone connection with this issue, even those people who have been associated with cleanliness don't have to pay attention to this kind of heart attack.
I would like to thank you for your phone.
The end of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the launch of the centenary celebrations of Bapus birth anniversary.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a text in Sanskrit - 'This is because of the self-reliance.'
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
In his vision, the National Human Rights Commission, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1993.
The Commission is completing its 25 years over a few days.
The Human Rights Commission has not only protected human rights but also increased human self-respect.
Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of our country, clearly said that democracy is not our own idea.
During the 25-year journey, this institute has created an ideal and trusted environment among the people.
I think this is a very happy event for the healthy society and the best democratic values.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 States along with National Human Rights Activities.
As a society, we need to understand and work towards human rights, which is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, if the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan is coming in October, they cannot remember that the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraja Sindhi begins.
These great personalities are inspiring all of us, bowing to them.
On 31st October, Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary is being held in Mann Ki Baat in detail, but for a few years on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, a competition is being organized in all small and big cities of India, villages and streets in the name of 'Run for Unity'.
This year, our villages, streets, cities and cities have to be organised by Reformer Units.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the entire country.
On 31st October, through the run for unity programme, we must focus on our efforts to cover all sections of society and all sections of the country in the midst of unity.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August, 2018
Today, the country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the people on this Punya Diwas.
Raksha Bandhan is considered a symbol of mutual love and trust of brothers and sisters.
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories that have embraced the people of two different countries and religions in the footsteps of faith.
In a few days, the celebration of Janmashtami has come.
My heartfelt congratulations to all people on Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Sanskrit Day is celebrated on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and Shravana Purnima.
I compliment all those who are engaged in raising this great heritage and bringing it to the common man.
Though Tamil is the oldest language in the world, we are proud to have played a very big role in the promotion of Sanskrit languages and wisdom since the Vedic times.
You will be happy to know that the people of Mattur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in a cultural language.
That's why any microscopic discourse or issue can be explained properly.
At the same time, it is easier to understand that it is related to our soil and our tradition.
For example, to explain the significance of the Guru in life - Ekampi writer, Guru, Shishisham, Prabodhyati, Nasti Tad-Drava, Yad-Datwahiani Bhavet.
Sarveya recalls Radhakrishna.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as a teacher day all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the eve of the Teachers Day.
At the same time, I compliment your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear people, our hard-working farmers have come with new hopes for years.
Rainfall relieves plants, trees and dry reservoirs in extreme summer.
But sometimes the rains and the destructive floods come along.
Nature is coming to a state where rains are more than rains.
We have already seen that the terrible floods in Kerala have severely affected the lives of the people.
Today, the entire country is with Kerala in this calamity.
We have sympathy with those who lost their own.
Though the loss of lives cannot be solved, it is sure to ensure that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural disaster will recover as soon as possible.
I am convinced that Kerala will swept away due to the enthusiasm and bravery of the people.
The destruction of accidents is unfortunate.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity are in danger.
Wherever there is an accident, everybody is doing something in their own way from Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, to revive the lives of the people in Kerala or in the district or region of India.
All ages and all the works are playing their role.
Everybody is contributing to slackening the sufferings of the people of Kerala and sharing their grief.
We know that the soldiers of the armed forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save people from the flood.
My dear people, this time Mann Ki Baat's suggestions were checked.
The topic written by more people from all over the country was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, our beloved.
Kirti from Gaziabad, Swati from Sonipam, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Dream Banaraji from West Bengal, Ashish Pande from Katihar in Bihar, etc.
On August 16, the country and the world were sorry to hear the death of Atal ji.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister was the leader of the country.
In a way, for the last 10 years, we have been away from active politics.
There was no hurdle in the news, it wasn't evident in public life.
The 10-year interval is very big, but after 16th August the country and the world have seen that the period of ten years has not been made even a minute interval in the minds of the common people of India.
Whatever love and respect Atal ji had, the sorrow that spread all over the country shows his vast personality.
India will be entitled to Atal ji in the name of the 99th Constitution Amendment in 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
In the first place, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit set as per the Prevention of uantity Act has been transformed into two thirds.
At the same time, clear guidelines have been set for disqualification of party changers.
For years, the political culture that has been set up in India has been established by a sizeable cabinet, which has been set up by big cabinets, has not only divided the departments but also enjoyed political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
His footsteps waited for money and resources.
And enhanced efficiency.
The vision of a person like Atal ji is through this change and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atal ji was a patriot.
During his tenure, the budget was changed.
Earlier, following the traditions of the Englishmen, the budget was presented at 5:00 in the evening because it was the time of the start of the Parliament in England.
In 2001, it turned to 5:00 in the evening and turned to 11:00 in the morning.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was created during Atal ji's regime and given its authority in 2002.
The National Flag can be hoisted in public places, in which the departments have joined.
It's a good thing, it's good for democracy.
It will be a great honour for Atal ji to have healthy democracy, to develop good habits of democracy, to strengthen democracy and to take discussions with open mind.
Reiterating his vision of a developing and prosperous India, I pay homage to Atal ji for all.
A few days ago, the Annual Session of Parliament ended.
You will be happy to know that the productivity and productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the 74 of the Rajya Sabha is 74.
Besides the interests of the party, all members have passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills of Rajya Sabha as a result of their efforts to make the annual session more effective.
This year's session of Parliament will be remembered as a commemorative session of social justice and youth.
During the conference, important bills used for the youth and the backward communities were passed.
For centuries, the need for creation of OBC commissions like the Scheduled Tribes Commission was increasing.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has succeeded in making the OBC Commission this time and has given constitutional authority to it.
This step will be a step towards the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill has also been passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will protect the betterment of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
At the same time, it will prevent the injustice of the culprits, and it will fill confidence in the millions of communities.
Any kind of injustice and culture cannot be tolerated against women's strength in the country.
The country isn't ready to tolerate the culprits who are blaming.
Therefore, the Parliament Passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and the Department of Strong Penalty was ensured.
You must have read in the newspaper a few days ago, the court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, in a two-month-long trial of the adult adult adult.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan also decided such a quick decision.
The Act will play an important role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
However, in this session of the Rajya Sabha, it could not be passed and I assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands with their strength to justify them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
Ladies and gentlemen, now the attention of millions of people in Jakarta is being laid in the Asian Games.
Every day in the morning, in the first newspaper, in the television, in the middle of the news and in the social media, which Indian players have won the medal.
The Asian Games are still running.
My best wishes to all the medal winners for the country.
Our girls have a lot of medals for the country, this is a very positive sign.
The medal winners also have 15-16-year-old youth.
It is a good indication that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages and they have achieved this success through hard work.
I once again congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and hope that the rest of the players will have a good performance.
I extend my best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskar Bhavnaji, I respect the idea of the child.
We all have seen building houses and buildings with stones and rocks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that an excellent, excellent and magnificent temple of a single rock was built.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the only place where this unbelievable harmony of architecture and engineering can be seen.
It will surprise anyone who is known as Rani Ki Waw, built in the 11th century at Pan in Gujarat.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is the Indian Prime Minister, Dr.
M.
He is supreme in that part of the country, and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and self-confidence.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, the engineers of our country have shown their own personality all over the world.
Now when we celebrate the Engineer's Day, we need to think about the future.
There's a workshop.
Today, the Disaster Management has become a big thing.
The world is facing natural calamities.
What kind of structural engineering should be in this situation
How can we determine the priorities to build without waste
We have to think of several such things while celebrating the Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Sometimes due to India's geography and diversity, rains are also liked.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
The football player in Thailand took the team of 12 children to the cave while their coach was roaming.
It's gonna take a few hours to go inside the cave.
Because they didn't find any other way, they took refuge on a small rock inside the cave - it's not one or two days, but eighteen days.
If the children don't see death in front of them, you can imagine how it will happen every minute when they have to live straight.
On one hand, they were straightening the accident, on the other hand, together with human values in the world.
People all over the world prayed to keep these children safe.
But finally, when good news came, peacefully all over the world, pleasure.
But I think I can see this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it is a matter of learning and understanding the behaviour of everyone.
A jawan of the Thailand Navy had to sacrifice his lives in this venture.
The world is astonished that in such a difficult environment, they have not hoped with so daring and forgiveness in a dark cave full of water.
It shows miracles happen when humanity joins together.
It was the specialty of the poems of Suraj ji that hope, faith, determination and self-confidence were sounding.
It will be very powerful and inspiring to all that we have said to the Indians.
It's dark.
Veerj ji pays homage to him.
"Our Prime Minister, my name is true.
I have received administration as a first year student in Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the stress and education of the exam, and what's your message to students like me
"July and August are important for the farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called college's picnic season.
This is the time when millions of youngsters, like truth, get out of school and go to college.
If the examination papers and answers go on in February and March, it is time to play April-May vacations and wait for results, to decide on the future directions in life and to choose cuisine.
The kids come from the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professionals.
I am confident that my young friends will be very excited and happy from the beginning of their life.
For the first time, he went out of the house and went out of the village and went out of a safe environment and had to be supposed to be sufficient.
So many youngsters leave their homes for the first time and come out to give a new direction to life.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join.
Be quiet, enjoy life, know the pleasure of the soul in life.
There's no way out of books, learn, but there must be a habit of finding new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
Your childhood friends are unlimited, but it is a matter of utmost consciousness in their own way to find and create new friends.
Learn something new, get new skills, learn new languages.
While talking about the season, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh was watching how he succeeded in surviving the challenges of life.
There are so many students who have been inspired by the dedication and dedication of ourselves, from such a poor family and from the challenges.
The father is a DDC driver, Prince Kumar of Delhi, and Abhay Gupta, who was studying under the Street Light in Kolkata, and the daughter of Afreen Sheikh, the autorickshaw driver of Ahmedabad, and the daughters of Nagpur, the school bus driver, and Kartik of Haryana, the father's career, and the father's favourites in Jharkhand.
If we look around, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires my mind.
I was once interacting with Indian youth in Sanjos city, known as the Technology Hub in America.
I would like to imagine how they can use their capabilities for India.
I called upon the brain drain to change the brain gene.
Two IIT professionals from Raibareli, Yogesh Saheb ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, took this challenge and made a different effort.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together with their professional skills made a start-up.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world but also informs them about any information on their own.
The Prime Minister, the District Magistrate, and the CDO, inspired people to use this app in the village of Taudhakpur in Rai Barreli.
This app is a way of bringing about a digital revolution in the village, recording, tracking and monitoring all the developments in the village is easier.
The App contains all the phone directories, News sections, Entress List, Health Centre and Information Centres in the village.
This app is very beneficial for the farmers and the farmers of the app as a market for their products in a way.
If you take care of this incident, the young man will see that he lives in America, in the midst of his lifestyle and thoughts, India will be left several years ago, but he knows from all over his village, understands the challenges and intellectual relations with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes due to a distance, sometimes a thin layer of thought is covered on it because of the environment, but if a small winter touches it then all things emerge again and then it takes it to the past.
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course Parpur Wari is a wonderful pilgrimage .
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is celebrated this time on July 23.
Parpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15-20 days before Asha Ekadashi i. e.
Millions of travellers participate in this journey called Wari.
Travellers of pilgrimage reach there for the darshan of Lord Vithal and Vithoba, called Vithoba and Panduranga.
God blesses the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
Going to the Valdoba Temple in Pumpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have a different experience.
If I get the opportunity to tell the listeners of Mann Ki Baat then you must join Parpur Wari once.
Even today in Maharashtra, innumerable purifications like Janeshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are being done.
The tradition of this monk continues to inspire every corner of India to fight blind respect.
All the ideals relating to which there is a message of harmony, love and brotherhood.
There is a mandate to fight society with respect to blind respect.
The man of the world was a brave and self-confidence.
He had the power and intelligence to show the British rulers their fault.
The British were scared of him three times in twenty years to treason.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present a joyous thing related to the world-wide Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
When he reached Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him about a hundred years ago and during this journey, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel got the opportunity to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very impressed by the worldwide Tilak.
Naturally, the British were unequivocal, and the collector continued to permit it.
However, Sardar Saheb Sardar Saheb was a stakeholder and he had to leave the post but he was determined to set up a statue of a world-wide man.
The statue was finally constructed and was inaugurated on 28th February, 1929 by Mahatma Gandhi.
The Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the worldwide.
The festival of Ganesh became a strong medium of enhancing social awakening, social awareness, dedication and equality among the people as well as celebrated with traditional respect and festivals.
It was a time to fight the British in the country.
It is evident from this that our ancient heritage and our heroes of history are still interested in our younger generation.
Today you will see Ganesh pillars in many cities and all the streets.
This is an excellent opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership, organizational awareness and develop their capabilities.
This time, from the statue of Ganesh ji, all the decorations should be environment friendly and all the cities should have an environment friendly Ganesha festival.
I'm gonna get these things to the people.
The world is self-confidence among the people and becomes a lizard, self-esteem is our birth rights, and will achieve it.
It is a time to say that Swaraj is our birth rights.
All Indians should have good results for good governance and development.
This is the creation of a New India.
After 50 years of Tilak's birth, that is, on 23rd July, another son of Bharat Baba was born.
He sacrificed his life as he thought we could breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrasekhar Azad.
There will be a young man who cannot be inspired by these versions, inspired by many youths like Sarfroshi Ki Tamana Ab Hamre Dil Me Hidekhana High Jor Kitana, Baju-e-Katna, Ashfaq Wallah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his enthusiasm for freedom are inspiring to many youngsters.
Azad has lost his life, but he never bowed his head during the foreign rule.
A few days ago, India's brave lady and farmer Hima Das won a gold medal at the 400-meter run at the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championship in Finland.
I was e-mailing the preparations for the Asian Games from Indonesia in response to my request to fear the solidarity of our second daughter.
Integration in e-mail, I am proud that the most important moment in the life of any athlete is the flag hoisting of the Tricolor and I have achieved it.
Ekta, we all are proud of it.
The name of the solitary country was bright.
In Tunisia, Ekta Gold and Bronze Medals were received at World Para Athletic Grand Pre-2018.
I bow down to the fear of solidarity and the fear of Yoga and Sundar Singh in the name of your braveness.
In this month of August, I extend my best wishes to all of you for being healthy and patriotic.
I'll once again get together in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You know, I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
Both teams performed well in this game.
Bowler Rasheed Khan from Afghan side also showcased exhibitions in IPL this year.
I remember, the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rishid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform to showcase their capabilities to our players.
Rasheed Khan represents a big player in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done a model for the whole world.
While buying Indian team trophy, the Afghan team participated in the first international competition and took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will join the sportspersons with each other in the same way.
My dear countrymen, the 4th Yoga Day on 21st June was a different sight.
To see the whole world becomes one.
In Ladakh's high snowy summit, the soldiers of India and China jointly performed yoga.
Yoga is doing the work of breaking all the borders and bringing people together.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from over 100 countries have made this occasion a big festival without any change in caste, religion, region, color, women and men.
While people from all over the world have participated in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm, it is natural to double it in India.
It is a matter of great pride for the country that 125 crore people have done yoga in our country's security forces and water-cars.
Some brave soldiers performed yoga in the interception and some performed yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our air warriors in the midst of the sky, at a height of sixteen thousand feet above the earth, made yoga sustainable.
They did swimming in the sky, but seem to be not on the plane.
Yoga has been performed in schools, colleges, offices, gardens, high buildings and toys.
Yoga has crossed the tribes, religions and regions, and we have been relying on Vasudhaiva Kumbh for centuries.
Our sages, sages and other architects have shown that Yoga is indeed focusing on any matter.
Most people will make it a part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, I have written on the MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell you about Dr.
It's right.
Remember the doctor only when we have a problem.
However, this is a day that marks the achievements of our doctors and it is a great opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society.
The role of the doctor is not confined to cure the disease.
He said that today the doctor has the privilege of treating not only, but also heals. He has a great experience of how it affects our lives on common lifestyle.
With their capabilities and skills, Indian doctors have depicted their personality all over the world.
The heads of the medical sector are also aware of the difficulty and redressal of disease related problems.
Through Mann Ki Baa, I extend my greetings to our doctors friends on the occasion of Dr.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a prosperous history without a month or day without any history.
'Thank you very much for your phone call.
It's true I'm coming to Maghar on 20th.
Do you know why he went to Magaher
There was a belief that those who died in Magahar would not be heavenly.
On the other hand, those who die in Kashi will have heaven.
Magaher was considered indecent, but Saint Kabir didn't believe it.
They are so inspiring in today's era.
That is, the real archaeological saint knows and understands the pain of others.
He who doesn't know the pain of others is silent.
At that time, there was a chauvinism and conflict in the world, and he gave a message of peace and harmony.
Together with the world minds, he worked to remove the interactions.
His words are true even after centuries.
Likewise, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev is a guru.
He has shown ways to millions of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate the variety of differences in the society and to transform mankind into one.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'Serving the poor and the needy is God's service.
Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated in 2019 on the occasion of the 5th Bright Celebrations.
I want all of us to be participants with enthusiasm and zeal.
I urge you all to think about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and new ideas about how to celebrate the fifteenth birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in the society, and make preparations, and very importantly celebrate the light festival as an inspiration.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific event that took place in Jallianwalabagh has snatched the entire humanity into a hundred years in 2019.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, Shriman Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written on the mobile app on 6th July, 2019.
Shyam Prasad is the birthplace of Mukherjee.
In this programme, I want to tell people about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
Thank you very much for the first time.
Dr.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convention of Calcutta University in Bengali, in 1937, taking the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
When English ruled, somebody in Calcutta University was the first to speak in Bengali language in the Convocation.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and made a strong platform.
In Indias first industrial policy announced in 1948, his ideas and visions have been marked.
He had a dream that India should be professionally self-sufficient and prosperous in all spheres.
He wanted SMEs to pay attention to handlooms, textiles and sericulture.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi-Village Industries Board were set up between 1948 and 1950 to facilitate their financial assistance and organizational mechanisms for sustainable development of Small Industries.
Indias defence manufacturing and defence manufacturing is also needed by Dr.
The most important thing for Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the integration of India, for which he had to sacrificed his lives at the age of fifty.
Come on.
People spoke of their imaginations, their griefs and their achievements.
In far-flung villages, girls provide services from pension to passport to the elderly of the village through Public Service Centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing ice cream industry with cereals.
Like unknowing light in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are providing medicine centres and medicines at affordable prices in nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was looking for jobs two-three years ago, today a business itself is successful.
It's not only that, it's working for 10-50 people.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management in the Tinkering Labs of the school at their younger age.
There are some people in the community who don't speak of despairing things, without talking about failures, without trying to make confidence, without finding ways to break together.
In such an environment, it is not the best of the government when the common man comes with ideas and new enthusiasm and the events that have happened in his life.
Even a small child in a small village can be inspired by 125 crore people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring and inspired to do something.
A new joy and a new zeal to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I'm very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people were associated with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can feel the smell of good.
Last day, one thing came to me, it's a different experience.
Farmers are associated with the schemes and worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers.
In a way, from crop production to marketing, the farmers have a big role in the entire range and they are trying to ensure double profits by contributing to the contribution of the farmers and they need good seeds to improve the crop.
The seed bank has been made for that.
The women are looking at this seedbank and the women are linked to it.
I knew something, some might have known, some might have been unaware, but millions of people continue to do some good things, many good wishes to everyone.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be a year in the middle of GST.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, today it has really changed.
People from different political ideas, people from different states and people from different states, but all the decisions taken in the GST Council are unanimously taken.
Before GST, there were many types of taxes in the country and there was only one type of tax in the country.
GST is a victory of honesty, this is a festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint of Inspector Raj related to tax was raised in the country.
In GST, IT and Information Technology have replaced the Inspector.
From Return to Refund, everything is going on online through information technology.
GST was perhaps the worlds largest tax reform programme.
This is because the people of the country have adopted such a huge tax reform in India and the success of GST can be ensured through manpower.
It was generally thought that such a big reform would take 5-7 years to achieve the full success of such a large population in such a big country.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar.
Yes, I want to say something about them.
These six women of India, their team, returned to India on May 21, after roaming around the world on the INSV surface in the ocean for more than twenty-two days.
The entire country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to see these daughters, listen to their travels.
Once again, I compliment the world for telling them that India is not very bad to enhance the dignity of the Navy, especially the women of India.
Nobody's brave.
If we pay attention to the development journey of humanity, it is seen that there has been progress from the pregnancy of any adventure.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On May 16, five tribal children from one ASHAM School, Chandrapur, Manisha Dhru, Pramesh Ale, Umanata Madavi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam climbed the highest height of the world.
These children from ASHAM school were trained on August 2017 and were trained in Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were elected under Mashin Shaurya.
They won Everest as per the name and they were proud of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those associated with Chandrapur School and to these small kids.
Shivangi Pathak, 16, was the youngest Indian girl from Nepal to take Everest.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those brave men, especially to women.
It's tagging each other and challenging them.
This fit India campaign is being organized by everyone.
In the film field, sports, the common people of the country, the soldiers of the army and the school teachers participated in it and listened to its sounds all around.
If we fit, India too fit...
Captain Virad Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team is also challenging me, I have taken his challenge and this is a good thing.
Such challenges will fit us and encourage others to be fit.
My dear people, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard something about players and players.
Last time the dogs of Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme, sir.
"Thank you very much for calling on the phone.
It's true that the games that were playing on every street were part of all the children's lives are decreasing today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes, sometimes, in the night, after dinner, the kids were playing for hours with smoothness.
Outdoor and Indoor.
The solidarity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these games.
The same game is known in different names at different places.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It plays with a size of 8:8 size squareboards, or a pigeon, or a pigeon.
This game was often played in all kingdoms.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara, in Madhya Pradesh, and in Kerala, palms in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, in Tamil Nadu, and in Changapo in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people from all over the country don't know the language, yeah.
It'll be said we're not playing this game.
Who don't play kids and columns in childhood
Children and colonies are playing in villages and cities.
It was called different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Billa.
It's called Gulibadi in Odisha and is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
Like the season to fly the city.
When everybody runs the city, everybody plays and shows the different qualities in us without any laziness.
The elders look serious, but when they play, the kids hiding in them come out.
Traditional games encourage our technological thinking, concentration, awareness and prosperity along with physical ability.
We also know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware of the society and the environment.
Calling people, we can build a large historic collection of our traditional games.
This time theme is to defeat plastic waste - Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to understand the importance of this theme and don't use polythene, low quality plastic, we can try to reduce the impact of plastic waste on nature, on wildlife and on our health.
See, know and see a lot of suggestions made by the World Environment Day website wed-India 2018 in a very attractive manner, and try to implement it in everyday life.
When there's a severe heat, when the rain doesn't end, when there's unbearable cold, everyone starts saying like a specialist like global vomiting, climate change.
But can you just talk about it
All this is basically climate change, the result.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live with nature and live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi argued for it in life and in all walks.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a key role in the POP-21 Paris Agreement, and we have united the world through International Solar Alliance.
How can we go on this
What can you do with a new one
It's rainy season.
It is reported that preparations are being made to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21 all over the world.
Yoga for Unity has been re-recognised for the past few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to see us like a father.
If all these qualities are friends, the Yogi is successful in all kinds of fears.
I once again urge all the people to create a healthy, prosperous and well-being nation to promote our heritage of Yoga.
My dear countrymen, today is 27 May and the first Prime Minister of India is the memorial of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Congratulations to Panditji.
This month's memories are linked to another person, heroes.
In May 1957, Indians showed their strength to the English.
Veerasavarkar wrote that in 1857, it was not a jealousy, but the first fight for freedom.
Savarkar's life was full of specialties.
But he was a great poet and a social reformer, and he always emphasized the importance of harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji has given a very excellent description of Power.
Savarkar walked together with poetry and revolution.
He was a sensitive poet and also a brave revolutionary.
If there is a desire to do something, it is determined to achieve success in all the commitments.
It's not just a matter of Seeker, you can see it in every corner of India.
If you look around, you can see how people fail the commitments.
If we still go to a tea chamber, we must have taken care of some of the nearby discussions and dialogues while enjoying tea.
These discussions may be related to politics, socialism, films, sports, sportspersons, problems of the country, these are the solutions.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than seventy children.
He opened a school called Asha-Ashwasan for children living on the streets and streets, for which the poor tea farmers spend 50 of their income.
He arranges for education, health and food to all children coming to school.
I'm D.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has congratulated the teachings and dedication of Prakash Rao and the new direction for the lives of poor children.
He has left the darkness of his life.
There'll be many things like this to you.
There will be innumerable incidents.
Come on, let's encourage good.
I'll wait for the moon a few days.
Everyone hopes to celebrate this Eid with great enthusiasm, especially children will get good gifts on this occasion.
Id hopes to strengthen harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Maybe next month in Mankibat.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
71 countries including India participated in the event.
When such a big event takes place, imagine what will be the atmosphere there when thousands of players from all over the world participate.
Who can avoid this in an atmosphere consisting of excitement, enthusiasm, ideas and hopes and achieving achieving all.
The performance of India in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton has been shown.
India won 66 medals including 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This success will be proud of all Indians.
Everything's buried in the same spirit.
The words will be straightforward to make it clear.
But I want to hear you from those players.
It was my dream that India and Manipur were not a sportsperson.
Do you know that this time all the restaurants from India have won medals
They won all the medals they participated in the Manika Batra.
She is the first Indian woman to win the Gold Medal for India at Personal Table Tennis.
India got the highest medal shooting.
Fifteen years old shooter Anish Bhawanwala is the youngest player to win gold for India at Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Choudhary is the only Para Power Lifter in Commonwealth Games Medal for India.
It is a special feature that this time more than the medal winners are women.
Whether it's a squash or a boxing or a white lifting, the women have wondered.
The last fight in Badminton is India's two players, Saina Nehwal and P.
Sindhu was in the midst.
Everyone was keen to get both the medals for India even though they were contesting.
The sportspersons participating in the games have gone from different parts of the country and from small towns.
They have the role of their friends who have empowered them all around.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I called upon people, especially youngsters, to become fit India.
Let us cooperate with fit India and guide fit India.
I am glad that people are very excited to join it.
Shearing his own pictures in the swimming pond of Shashikant Bhos, My Weapon Is My Body, My Almond Is Water, My World Is Swimming...
Dhaul Prajapati shared his pictures of trekking and wrote that fit India is a journey and trekking for me.
It is heartening to see the well-known people inspire our youth to fit India in a very attractive manner.
Cinema Kalakaran has shown a video on Akshay Kumar.
You must see that he's exercising with Wooden Beed.
He says this exercise is very good for the outer and stomach muscles .
Another video is in the process.
He's playing volleyball with people in it.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences in fit India initiatives.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for us and all over the country.
One more thing is to say that Yoga is the name of the Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the fit India programme and you must have started preparing.
The importance of International Yoga Day on 21st June has now been accepted all over the world.
You'll be ready now.
Not alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your school, everywhere, everybody, every age, every man or woman should try to connect with yoga.
There is no need to say in India or anywhere in the world that how Yoga is beneficial for the entire development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You must have seen my animated video is very popular.
They're very minute to show a teacher through animation.
You'll get the benefit.
I want to tell you something by inviting you for a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time learning something new.
Otherwise, the intensity offers a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to escape from the oceans, pen and computers and to experience life in a new way.
My young friends, I am inviting you to a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, Sports, Human Resource Development Ministry and Ministry of Drinking Water have jointly launched a Swachh Bharat Samar Internship 2018.
If students of college, NCC youth, NSS and Nehru Yuva Kendra Ventures want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and for the country, if they want to join it for the change of society then they can join it and this is the opportunity for those who want to do something efficient in the society with a nutritious energy.
It will give support and strength to sanitation and it will be happy that when the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi was celebrated on 2nd October, something could be done before.
The best members participating in this event will be awarded to all those who have done good work in the colleges and those who have done good work in the university at the national level.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit letters to those who have completed very well.
I once again invite students, students and youth to internship and benefit from it.
In MyGOV, Swachh Bharat Summer Internship can be registered.
I hope that our youth will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I want to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, know about the events, send a picture, send a video.
Use this holiday for a new experience.
I urge the people to see that how many people are doing good things in every corner of our country and how good things are going on.
I have seen the story of the youth who have gathered selflessly for the education of the poor children.
In comparison to these youngsters, a big programme has been started for education of the street children and children living in the halls.
The condition of children who are begging on the roads or doing small jobs has grabbed them so that they get off for this activity.
Youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have been engaged in this Bhagirathi effort to change socially from their busy life to two hours.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly region of Uttarakhand are inspiring the farmers across the country.
They changed their fate not only in their own way, but in the region.
Ragi, Chaulai (Maranth), rice or barley are mainly cultivated in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
As a hilly area, the farmers did not get the cost offering them.
This biscuit of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers formed a cooperative body in Munnar village and started a biscuit factory.
The daring of the farmers is linked to the National Livelihood Mission.
This bus is now available to 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani, not only in Bageshwar district but also in Bageshwar district.
The annual distribution of the team has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but more than 900 households have also been employed as a result of reduction in employment generation from the district.
Do we think water conservation is a social responsibility
How do we preserve every rainbow
We know that water conservation is not a new issue in the minds of Indians.
There's no topic in the book, no language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They preferred the importance of every drop of water.
They looked for new ways to keep every drop of water.
There are large rock paintings in Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovalpatti and New Kotai and many ponds are still like tourist centres.
However, don't forget that these big conservations for water conservation are a living example of our ancient efforts.
The ponds called Rani Ki Bawadi of Adalaj and Patna in Gujarat are UNESCO World Heritage Centres, which are worth seeing.
These reservoirs are in a way water temples.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbavadi in Jodhpur.
The most important thing is that this is India's largest and beautiful bawadi (Kulam) which is in a water-strong area.
April, May, June and July are the best time to accumulate rain water and we will also get the benefits of the preparations we are preparing.
In the last three years, everybody has done some things in their own way in water conservation and water management.
In terms of 2017-18, Rs. 64,000 crore has spent 55 of the total amount of Rs.
In the last three years, this kind of water conservation and water conservation has benefitted more than 150 lakh hectares of land.
Sasur, who was dried up with the help of about 40-45 villages, revived the rivers of Khaderi.
Whether the animals or the birds or the farmers or the agriculture or the village, how blessed is this success for all of them.
We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but nobody knows how to live peacefully and inclusively.
Please discuss this issue in the Mann Ki Baat programme to know about this.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multifaceted manifestation.
I had a habit of listening to it, but I didn't know the language, but I got up in the morning and listened to Rabindra Sangeet in the radio... turned into my habit... enjoyment.
You too could have been influenced by Ravindra Sangeeth and his poems.
I salute Rabindranath Tagore on this occasion.
The month of Ramadan is celebrated all over the world with respect and respect.
When man is hungry on the social side of fasting, he knows the hungry of others.
The others feel thirsty when they are thirsty.
Once a man asked the speaker, what is the best thing in Islam.
The prophet replied, "Any poor or hungry person gives food and behave with compassion or with all you know.
People pay homage to those who pay homage to this month.
According to the prophet Mohammed, a person is not rich, but money and wealth.
India must be proud of the power of compassion, service and sacrifice that is the land of Lord Buddha, who has guided millions of people all over the world.
Recalling this Buddha Purnima, the Prime Minister recalled our commitment to walk through the path shown by him, to determine and live thereafter.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the most necessary human value around the world today.
Buddhas inspiration is immense in the social vision of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb said that my social vision was established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my vision are in religion, not in political science.
I have swassed them from my Guru Buddha.
Babasaheb has empowered millions of people who are oppressed and deprived, who are deprived of being oppressed, despite being oppressed.
There's no greater example of compassion.
This painful cause of people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
The advice of Lord Buddha is traditionally available anywhere in Asia.
I am happy to note that the Government of India is participating in revival of several Buddhist temples, including the centuries old grand Anand Temple of Myanmar.
Today, there are scenes of conflict and human suffering all over the world, and the advice of Lord Buddha guides us to be compassionate.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the world who believe in the principles of compassion, respected by Lord Buddha.
For the entire world, I pray for the blessings of Lord Buddha to fulfil my responsibility for the creation of a peaceful, compassionate world based on his advice.
The people of India, spread all over the world, had a new confidence.
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On May 11, 1998, westwards of India were tested in Pokhran, Rajasthan.
It's been twenty years since Lord Buddha's blessings on the day of Buddha Purnima.
Indias experiments were successful and India was capable of scientific and technological.
The day is depicted as an exhibition of military power in Indias history.
Lord Buddha demonstrated to the world that the power of the soul is essential for peace.
Likewise, when you get strength as a nation, you will be able to comfort with all of you.
It is important not only for the country to examine it in May 1998, but also for how it has been done.
The land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India will always undermine new goals and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave a mantra, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan...

We've told you about the water for birds and animals in the summer.
There are letters of farmers brothers and sisters about the things that are going on from Kisan Melas and farming across the country.
Some people who are aware of water conservation have suggested.
On the occasion of Festival, there will be letters about our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
Why don't you change in these things, in these experiences, such inspiration, energy, self-confidence and zeal of doing something for the country are filled.

When I am aware that a researcher from Karinganch, Assam, Ahmad Ali, has made 9 schools for the poor children with the strength of his will, I can see the immense will power of this country directly.
When Dr. Ajit Mohan Choudhary of Kanpur heard the story of going to the footpath and examining the poor and giving them free medicines, there was a chance to understand the people of this country.

This confidence, this positivity will help in realizing our vision of a New India, and will be fulfilled.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come up with agriculture.

I went to the Farming Festival held in Delhi last day.
I had a very comfortable experience in my discussions with farmers brothers and scientists, knowing about many experiences related to agriculture, understanding and introducing new innovations related to agriculture.
But Meghalaya was the most influential to me and the farmers there.
This state, which is very slightly large, has shown great work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya produced records in 2015-16 over the previous five years.
In a detailed statement, when I consider the MSP, the cost of the length and breadth of other workers, the cost of their four-four cattle, the cost of the machine or the cost of the machine, the cost of the seed, the cost of all kinds of fertilizers, the cost of liquidation, the cost of the state commodity, the interest on the working capital, the rent on the songs and the cost of the songs, and not only this, the subordination of his family, who is working in the field of agriculture.

Today, all the departments and Ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness or the Ministry of AYUSH or the Ministry of Women and Child Development, are working together for a healthy India, and are focusing on affordable healthcare along with defence measures.
Resistance of disease is the cheapest and easiest healthcare.
The more we are aware of the immune system, the benefits of the individual, the family and the society will be achieved.
If life is to be healthy, it's clean for the first time.

In the new attractive ways of doing yoga, inspire children, youth and elderly people.
Various programmes related to Yoga are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can awakening about Yoga as a movement from now onwards to Yoga Day

My dear countrymen, April 14, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
For him, the industry was a good medium of providing employment to the poor and the poor.
Today, we are successfully conducting the Make in India Movement in the country.
With his vision, the Smart Cities Mission has been launched in the country today, and all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns in the country, be it good roads or water facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance in self-reliance.
He wanted no person to be in poverty every day.
At the same time, he believed that their poverty could not be removed only by paying wages for the poor.
Today, the beginnings like Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are giving birth to our youngsters.
The Prime Minister emphasized the use of water for the development of the country, and various River Wali Authoritys, various water related commissions, all are born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce the history of waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the need to work together between the Centre and the States for the growth of the country in federalism and federal system.
He showed us that it is not necessary to live in a big or rich family to reach higher heights, but to fulfil the dreams of people living in a poor family in India, and to make efforts to realize those dreams.
Baba Saheb has played Ambedkar's game.
There will be special programmes on rural development, poverty welfare and social justice in India.
I urge you all to participate in these events with enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are coming in the coming days, the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, Hanuman Jayanti, Ester and Vaishali.
On the occasion of Lord Mahavir's birth anniversary, it is time to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire us all.
My best wishes to all people on Mahavir Jayanti.
He recalls the inspirational advice of Jesus Christ, who gave the message of peace, harmony, justice and mercy to the human beings.
In April, Vaishali will be celebrated in Punjab and West India.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and some are writing.
We see the colour of the sea blue, but we understand from our experience that the water doesn't color.
Did we ever think why the water of the river or the sea looks colorful
The same question came to the notice of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist gave birth to modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, we are the first to be Bharat Ratna C.
One of his findings is known as Raman Ifct.
Because this is the day he found the truth of light scattering, and he got the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
India is proud of Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Scientists from Hargovind Khurana, like Satyendranath Bose.
Satyendranath Bose has been named as Boson Particulars.
In the recent past, I got the opportunity to attend a programme in Mumbai and was inaugurated by the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very happy to know about the miracles in scientific sector.
The Artificial Intelligence helps manufacturing of robots, botts and other specific measurements.
Now the machines are summing up their minds through self-learning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
I asked the scientific community how artificial intelligence can be helpful in the programme on Artificial Intelligence to facilitate the ease of living of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Can we know more and more about natural evils through artificial intelligence
Can the farmers help in agricultural production
Is Artificial Intelligence accessible to healthcare services more easier and helpful in treating diseases in modern ways
Last day, I got the opportunity to participate in the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat along with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There a young man told me about developing a digital instrument.
I think many such things can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies can be called Value Neutral.
Any machine we want will do.
But it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Elva Edison, who found the bulb, failed many times in his experiment.
Once asked about this, he replied, "I have sought ten thousand ways to find a bulb.
That is, Eddison made his failures even stronger.
True, fortunately, I am in Aravalli, the land of Maharshi Aravind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British administration, fought against them and raised questions to British India.
The idea of repeated questions to know the truth is very important.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific research.
Why, don't sit quietly until you get answers to questions about how.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to scientists and all others associated with science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages about all issues such as security, atrocities, and people write something related to it.
Shri Rabindra Singh from Pune and Shri Narendra Modi on mobile app are on security of jobs.
He has written that there are no security norms where there are factories and construction works in our country.
The Prime Minister said that on 4th March, Indias National Security Day, hence, he urged people to talk about security in the Mann Ki Baat programme to be aware of security.
When we talk about public security, two things are very important, and the advances and advances.
One need at the time of accident - safety during discipline - second is important in daily life - safety in aerid life .
If we are not aware of security in everyday life, if we don't get awake, it's difficult to be in danger.
We must have written on the boards showing us sometimes that if we don't wake up, the accident will certainly be a wrong loss, loss of joy and laugh, without leaving the world so quickly, ensure safety.
I would like to tell you that the Fire Brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to school once a week or once a month and conduct a demonstration in front of the children.
That's why there are two advantages that Fire Brigade will have a habit of sitting carefully, and the new generation can know many about it.
In terms of dangers, India is a diverse nation with geographical and climate.
This country has straightened many disasters such as natural calamities, chemicals and business accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is in the forefront of facing accidents in the country.
The NDMA will swiftly reach out to rescue operations in various accidents such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones and landslides.
Twenty-three years ago, because of the heat-heat wav, thousands of people lost their lives.
The number of deaths due to heat in 2017 has decreased significantly to about 220.
It shows that if we give preference to security, we can secure security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, there are social organisations, awakening citizens - I congratulate all those who reach the path of rescue within minutes whenever there is a danger.
The number of such unrecognised heroes is no less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, the Armed Forces, the Paramilitary Forces, etc. have reached the territory and helps people without paying their lives.
We have to be a society that is aware of the danger.
In our culture, we look at values and talk about security values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
In our normal life, we travel on a plane once and we see the air hostess initially warns about security.
We must have heard it hundred times, but if someone takes us to the plane and tells us where every thing is, how do you use life jacket
That's why our ears on the plane have a habit of listening, but we don't even think these warnings are with me.
That's what happens in all the fields of life.
We shouldn't think that security is for anyone else.
If we all are aware of our security, the spirit of the security of the society will also be inclusive.
My dear countrymen, this time, with the objective of Swachh Bharat in the budget, the villages were focused on the theme West to Wealth and West to Energy from Bayogyas.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana aims at cleaning the villages, enhancing the livestock cultivation and transforming the ruins of agriculture and composta and biogyasa to generate funds and energy.
The number of cattle in India is the highest in the world, where about 300 million cattle and their cattle production is about 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, this is also going on.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in cleaning the village.
I invite you to be a part of this birth anniversary of Clean Energy and Green Job and move forward to make the waste of my village rich and to change the money.
My dear countrymen, so far we have heard about how many festivals like Film Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
However, as a strange initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first festival was celebrated.
The Festival, organised by Raipur, was aimed at creating awareness about cleanliness and creating awareness about the strange methods of utilizing the city's waste effectively and recycling the wind.
Several programmes were organised during the Festival, in which the elderly people participated.
Inspired by the programme of Raipur, different festivals were organized in other districts.
Everyone in their own way shared new ideas about cleanliness and discussed and poetry.
I congratulate the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of the state and all of them for this festival.
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
A lot of programmes are being organized in our country and the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is honoured by those who have done following work in different fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women's development beyond women's development.
I recall the words of Swami Vivekananda on this occasion.
He said that the idea of complete women is a complete freedom and this idea that Swamiji's advanced idea of women's strength in Indian culture reflects 25 years ago.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal partnership of women in all fields of social and economic life and it is our responsibility.
We are part of the tradition that men recognize in the name of women, and the kids were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kausalya-Nandan and Gandhari- sons.
Today, our women's strength reflects self-reliance and self-confidence through their work.
They moved themselves and carried the country and the society forward and carried it to a new goal.
Our vision of New India is a woman-powered, empowered and equitable partner in the overall development of the country.
What can be done by women's strength, many examples can be put forward and if you look around, you can see such stories that are inspiring for life.
I know something from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand should remember that this number is not very low - 15 lakh women have organized a Swachhta Abhiyan for a month.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that the Swachhta Abhiyan can be transformed into a common man's nature.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, in the three villages of Elephanta Island, 70 years after independence, there was news that the people there were so happy.
You know that Elephanta Island is 10 km away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive centre for tourism.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves there will see the light of electricity.
This is not only electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May light in the lives of the people, pleasure in life... when will there be more joy and excitement than this
My dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivaratri last day.
The month of March is the time to call abundant farming and pomegranate grapes and golden crops with salt, which is the specialty of this month.
Besides, this month, Holi is also celebrated as a favourite month.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with Harsholas.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in the celebrations.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of Kalpana Chawla, who had travelled to space.
They were inspired by millions of young people across the world, but the Calpan had rooted us in the danger of the Columbia Space port.
We lose Kalpana Chaula at such a young age. It's a sad thing for all of us.
I am glad to see that these women in India are gathering at a rapid pace and enhancing the pride of the country.
In ancient times, the pride of women in our country, their place in the society and their contributions are surprising all over the world.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Now, let's talk about Bei Bachao, Bei Padhao.
But in the ancient times Rachikupe, tells in the Skandapurana - Dasaputra, Samayya, Dashputra Yojana, this is the meaning of availability.
I mean, a daughter is the same as ten sons, you'll get the purity from ten sons in a woman.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This lady's strength lays down the entire country, the entire society and the family in the midst of unity.
Whether it is Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitrei Ei's punditism, the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meirabai, the ruler of Ahlayabai Holkar, or the courage of Rani Laxmibai, inspire us.
Increase the dignity of the country, Mr.
The Prime Minister said that the light is following a series of examples.
He writes that our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is an inspirational flight to Sukhoi 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, she has written about the world tour in INSV Tarini, the women members of the Indian Navy.
He pointed out that three brave women, Bhavnakanth, Mohana Singh, he would be the pilots of the Chaturvedi Air Warfare and training at Sukhoi 30.
Skilled women led by Vajpayee are proud to fly to San Francisco, USA in Delhi and to Air India's Boeing Jet.
Everybody should remember me...
These women who have been awarded the first woman Marchant Navy captain, first female train driver, first female firefighter, first female bus driver, first woman in Antarctica, first woman in Everest, first woman in Everest, and first woman in all such areas, have brought out abnormal vision of the stability of our womens strengths.
They waited for all the obstacles and all the commitments to the strength of Eiva, to pursue a new path.
Not only their contemporaries, but also the generations of inspiration.
They have a new enthusiasm and inspiration.
You will be able to make a book on these women that we have brought, so that all the people of the country should know about this women's strength and inspire you and their work in their lives.
This is available for e-Building in the website of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.
Women's strength has an important role in the active changes in this country and society.
When we talk about women's empowerment, I want to tell you about a railway station.
You will think of the relationship between railway stations and women's empowerment.
Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India to have all workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is an area affected by Maoism.
Himsa, invasions, bombs, guns, pistols, all this is a terrible atmosphere that the Maoists built there.
In such a horrific area, tribal women are getting themselves sufficient by running e-offices.
In a very short span of time, a lot of women have been associated with this.
This will also strengthen the environmental protection.
Congratulations to the District Heavy Corridor here, the District Government has played a vital role in the success of these women from granting Grands and circulations.
For centuries, individual and socially in our society, efforts have been made for social illiteracy and illiteracy.
A few days ago, in Bihar, he started such a thing.
In order to eradicate social inequalities in the state, the world's largest mankind has been completed at a height of 10,000 km.
Through this campaign, the society awakened witness against the misdeeds such as child marriage and women's system.
The state has decided together to fight crimes such as women and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers, sisters and sisters, who are encouraging and enthusiastic, were all participants in this fight.
The human ecosystem, including the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna, is unlimited to the border of the state.
To achieve the vision of development in the right way, the society must be free of indecency.
Come, let us together pledge to free the society from the evils and create a New India, a strong and capable India.
He was not aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
When I came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Yojana, when you started buying trees, the cost of death decreased by 75 percent.
For the past few days, a lot of people have been writing to me about this.
The objective of this scheme is to facilitate healthcare and enhance livelihood.
The trees available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 of the trees sold here in Brandday.
That's why good trees are available at a low cost.
More than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras are being set up across the country.
There's not only a small price of trees but also a new job opportunities for those who want to find individual jobs.
Affordable trees are available in Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Amrit Stores in hospitals.
The only objective of this is to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the country and to create a healthy India.
My dear countrymen, Mr Mangesh has shared a fography on the Narendra Modi App in Maharashtra.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola have organised the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to clean the Morna river.
Morna River flows for twelve months before, but only in the rainy season.
The river is full of cattle and cattle. It's painful.
A lot of waste is dragged on the river and its shore.
On January 13, a day before the Makar Sankranti, the two sides of the river Morna will be cleaned at fourteen places in the fourteen-kilometer area on the first step of Mission Clean Morna.
More than four thousand people from Akola, governmental organisations, school students, kids, elders, mothers and sisters, etc. participated in the Mission Clean Morna scheme.
On January 20, 2018, however, the Swachh Bharat Mission will continue every Saturday morning until the Morna river is completely clean.

The masses can bring big changes.
I would like to congratulate all the participants for making the people of Akola and the district administration there, and the people of Aurobindo, and the people of Aurobindo, and their efforts will inspire other people of the country.
Dear countrymen, you must have heard about the Padma Awards these days.

It's a citizen who can name anyone.
It has a transparent View because all the operations have been carried out online.
In a way, the election process for these awards has changed completely.
Generally, in cities, in newspapers, on TV, those who are not seen in the conferences will be given Padma Awards.
Aravind Gupta's award is Ke.
You will be happy to be a student of IIT Kapur and to make these Aravindan kuis a toy.
He has been creating sports with things that are left out to increase scientific priorities in the pockets for four decades.
He tries to inspire scientific experiments with unused leaves.
For this, cinema made in 18 languages in three and a half schools across the country will inspire Kai Khu.
Let me surprisingly make life, let me surprising.
One such story is from Sitawa Jodhi in Karnataka.
The goddess of women's empowerment doesn't just say.
For the last three decades, they have contributed significantly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in Balgaon.
They dedicated themselves to Goddess when they were seventy-seven, and they would be dedicated to the welfare of Goddesses.
Not only this, it has done unprecedented work for the betterment of millions of women.
Because of this interest, this is not just India but the world is respected.
The exhibition will be held in Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
He recognised the talent of Keerteku Maju Shyam for India overseas.
The story of tribal women Laxmiku in Kerala will surprise you.
Laxmiku ki Kalar lives at a place where he lives and lives in a humid hall in the tribal area of Dhukka.

Laxmi ji continues to serve the society through his knowledge about greenery.
The country has given Padma Shri to recognize this personality and contribute to the society.
During the age of 23, his husband died without treatment and was inspired to build a hospital for the poor.
Thousands of poor people are provided free treatment in the hospital to be built through their hard work.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, invite them to listen to their experiences.
Some of the efforts of the society must be made more than the awards.
Dear people, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On January 9, Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in South Africa.
On this day, we celebrate an unwavering relationship with Indians living in India and the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we have organized a programme and invite rooted parliamentarians and mayors in India all over the world.
The event was attended by Members of Parliament from many countries including Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Canada, Brian, Suriname, South Africa and America.

Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This is the last event of Mann Ki Baat this year and today is the last day of 2017.
I shared with you a lot of things this year.
The year will change after a few hours, but the sharing of these ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, Jesus Christ recalls the greatest lessons that we gave to Jesus Christ.
We see the summary of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahansar used to say that he should live with a sense of inequality.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji's courage and sacrifice is inspiring for us.
In this endeavour, he had to lose a lot personally.
It was a fortunate occasion for me that at the beginning of this year, Guru Gobind Singh was able to attend the light festival held in Patna Saheb on the occasion of the 3rd and 5th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
We can decide with our hearts to learn lessons from the great lessons and inspirational life that Guru Gobind Singh taught.
1 January, 2018, i.e. tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But I'm telling you that it's really specific.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
The entire India is enthusiastic to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
You will be proud to be a voter of the 21st century.

You're not just entitled to vote.
You can be the creation of the 21st century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century and what your dream of India should be in the 21st century.
Youngsters of New India are the synonym of enthusiasm, zeal and energy.
The dream of New India is fulfilled through our strong, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about a free India from caste, caste, terrorism and poison of corruption.
India free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunities, everybody's aspirations are fulfilling New India.
New India is the powers that lead us to peace, unity and harmony.
My youngsters should come forward and imagine how a New India will be formed.
How can we realize our ideas before 2022
How can India build us as our freedom fighters dreamt
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom struggle into a massive nation.
My young friends, we have to organize a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
The birthplace of development, the birthplace of progress and the birthplace of a capable and powerful India.
Today, many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
Our youth have come forward and succeeded in innovations and industrial entrepreneurship since skill development.
I would like to think about how the youngsters of this New India can get information about such opportunities, and at the age of 18, they will get natural information about the world and these projects so that a system can be made available.
Nothing is impossible for a person filled with positive thinking and enthusiasm.
There's a text in English, Pessimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The responsibilities and responsibilities that came were really inspiring.
It was a very pleasant experience.
Some people shared positively and positively affected events in their minds.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name's fishing.
I live in Mayor Vihar, Pocket 1, Case 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm talking from a place called Bodel.
According to my husband's instructions, one rupee of insurance was paid per month.
He died in an accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is happy jadhav.
The National Highway has been going through our different villages since 2017.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a shortage of water in our area and for the last 40 years we have been dependent on the pipelines of the soldiers.
Now put a pipeline...
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many such things in their own minds that have a positive change in the lives of people.
This is the New India that we are building together.
Recently, I was going to know about the inspirational story of Anjum and Bashir Khan Khatak, the leading Administrative Service in Kashmir.
He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination to get rid of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the terrorists had burnt his heritage.
Her family had to go out of her heritage, so much that there was terrorism and violence.
He chose a different way to serve people.
He saved himself from the opposite ecosystem and created the story of victory.
Today, he is inspiring not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also in the entire country.
Anju has proved that however bad the environment is, through positive steps, it cannot be despaired.
Last week, I had the opportunity to see some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
It was excitement, excitement, energy, dreams, vision.
I was inspired by the time I spent with those kids.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youths, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to say about the Sabarimala Temple of Kerala while discussing not only my country but also the world's famous religious places.
In this world famous temple thousands of devotees reach every year to get the blessings of Lord Ayyappaswamy .
How many devotees come, how big can it be to look at such an important place without waste
If there are mountains and forests, do you specially say
A police officer, Vijayan, started a programme called Punya Pungavan and started a awareness campaign on waste management.
There is a habit that if a devotee comes, the journey cannot be completed without any physical effort in the matter of cleanliness.
There's no bigger in this movement, no smaller.
All devotees are considered to be part of the worship of God for some time, work for cleanliness, work for elimination of waste.
It's very surprising that every morning the sight of the waste is surprising, all the pilgrims participate in it.
No matter how big a celebrity, no matter how big accommodation, everybody participates in the programme like a common devotee, and goes on purification.
There are many such examples before us.
The sacred garden of the sacred place in Sabarimala is a part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees.
There's a deep wound, and it's certainly going together to need cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we have taken a pledge to complete the incomplete mission of Babaji, a sacrificial Bapu, a Swachh Bharat and a Swachh Bharat.
Bapu tried his whole life for this one thing.
In rural and urban areas, there has been a widespread change in the cooperation of people.
The worlds largest survey Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted between 4th and 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements made in the quality of cleanliness in urban areas.
The Survey will be organised in more than four thousand cities for about forty crore people.
Talking to the citizens, he knows their response.
He will also review the use of Swachhata App and innovation of various services centres.
It will be examined whether all the arrangements have been made in the city to transform the cleanliness of the city into the nature of the people.
Don't let the government do the purification.
All citizens and citizen organisations have great responsibility.
I urge all the people to participate in the Swachhata Survekshan in the coming days with enthusiasm.
Try not to retreat your city, and your streets and villages.
On the basis of this survey, the ringing of cities will be done - if your city is more than one lakh people, if there are a few lakhs of people in the country's rankings then it should be your dream that you have the highest place in the local rankings and you should try it.
Come, let us once again recall Bapu's vision of Swachh Bharat and use the best initiatives for this.
My dear countrymen, some things may look very small, but as a society, there is a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I would like to share something like this with you on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat.
For centuries Muslim women were oppressing, but nobody discussed this.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have directed the Ministry of Minority Affairs to ensure that all the women applying to go alone are allowed to go to Haj.
I urge the women who are requesting to go alone to leave this hazard, to give them a chance to look after them in a special way.
India's development journey has moved on the basis of their talent in the strength of our women's strength.
I firmly say that our women and men should get equal rights, I want to get equal opportunities, and our constant efforts should be made to move together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us.
However, this will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from 10 ASEAN countries will come to India as Chief Guests on Republic Day.
This time it's not one day, it's ten chief guests.
It has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years and has completed 25 years of Indias collaboration with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that these great leaders from 10 countries of the world join together on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is the country of festivals.
I don't want to be a day that doesn't belong to the festival.
We have just celebrated Christmas now, the new year is about to come here.
May the New Year bring you happiness and prosperity.
Let us move forward with new freshness, new enthusiasm, joy and new vision.
The sun goes to Uttaranchal in January and celebrates Makar Sankranti this month.
This is a celebration of nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankrant, Magha-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu and all the festivals are special in its own way and they have their own importance.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th January and 17th January.
All the names of these festivals are different, but the basic elements are the same.
Many congratulations to the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
They're greater than us at the age, they're witnesses to every step in the country and every time.
I got the privilege of talking to Didi before going abroad.
It was a lovely conversation as the brother speaks to his sister with a lot of love.
I don't usually tell you about personal interactions like this.
Modi ji-Lattadidi, salute.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Modi ji, many greetings and best wishes.
May the health of the goddess be well-known and pray that the blessings of the goddess be up to us.
Before going to America, she was calling for a prayer.
I am glad to hear that Lataji-Modiji's phone will come.
Will you go back to me
Everybody at home...
Lataji, I think that with the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the audience.
You don't know what you are.
I know that India's pictures are changing when you come.
Modi ji-yeah.
My mother is happy to be in this love of Modi ji.
I am extremely grateful to Modi ji and Modi ji for remembering me.
Once again I pay my birthdays.
Modi ji was good to see when he came to Mumbai this time.
Modi ji, but I'll be late.
Modi ji had to come home and eat some Gujarati food from the hands of Didi.
Lota ji, of course.
I'll be fortunate.
Modi ji-Prayam Deepi
Lata ji.
My best wishes to Modi ji and Modi ji- Namaste.
Modi ji-Namste.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the times of festivals have come with new enthusiasm, new energy, new zeal and new determinations.
Now for weeks, the glimpse of festivals will be filled throughout the country.
Everybody in the family will join the festivals.
That's what you call the dark underneath analysis.
Perhaps there are only words in this word, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
On the one hand, when some houses are illuminated, on the other hand, think that darkness is covered in some nearby lights.
The real pleasure of these festivals is that when this darkness does not exist, it is less lighting.
They're looking for people's homes, sweets, food, and sending them to them.
This time, can you try to blind down the bottom of the salt with awakening and determination in this season of festivals
The laughing of the faces of many poor families will double your joy in the festivals, your face will be brighter, your lamp will brighter, your lamp will brighter.
Can we welcome Lakshmi in a new way this time
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi, because women bring good fortune and prosperity.
With his teachings and dedication, with intellect, many daughters who shine the name of the family and society and the nation will be among us.
Can you organise a programme to honour these Lakshmis of India on this occasion of Deepawali
There will be many women and daughters who do extraordinary things to us.
Our society should recognize such women, respect them, honour them in their name.
Together, we all have a massive gathering called 'Selfie with Daughter', as we have spread all over the world.
Likewise, this time the birth anniversary of Bharat Ki Laxmi will be organized.
Encouraging Laxmi of India is to strengthen the path of prosperity of the people of the country and the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have already said that through Mann Ki Baat programme, I have the opportunity to direct and indirectly interact with many people who don't know and know.
A student from Arunachal, Alina Thang sent me a very funny letter last day.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
When my exam results came this time, people asked me if I read a book named Exam Warriors.
After that my experience was very good.
If I read the book before the exam, I thought it was very good.
And this little friend has given me a job.
But I'm asking you to help me.
I'm sure it's all right.
I'm gonna think about it and I'm sure I'm gonna try to write it in my words and in my own way.
Once again I thank the younger friend of Arunachal, the student, Alina Thaiang.
Look.
This time, as we discussed the victory in the Open, the speech of Runner App Daniel Medalways was discussed and there was a good propaganda in social sciences.
I also spoke and showed me the game.
Madwedev's sympathy at Dan, 23, and his talent attracted everyone.
Of course, it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he failed 19 times with Grand Slam Jetta and Rafael Nadal, a Historian of Tennis.
If there were others on this occasion, they would have turned into sadness and despair.
His words were welcomed by the audience.
He lauded Nadal, the captain of Dan, and said how Nadal inspired millions of youth to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and victory of a man who failed in one game was worth seeing.
If you don't listen to the words of Madwede in Dan, you must see that video, especially to the youth.
There's a lot of learning from all sections, from all ages, and it's a great moment for the kingdoms.
The kingdoms are not big.
Life is a success.
It has been very beautiful in our country's sciences.
The thinking of our ancestors is surely greetings.
In the scriptures, it has been said that the world is composed of talent and dignity of a person who cannot win the mind if it is accompanied by the synergy of the supremacist Haratina Kasya Manujasyamani Kanchan.
This young sportsperson actually captured the minds of people all over the world.
My dear people, especially young friends, I'm going to tell you now directly for your good.
There will be debates, but there will be opposite parties, but some things will be bigger if you can stop it before it grows up.
When it grows very big, it's very difficult to stop some things.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully, we can save many.
It's because of nicotine that doesn't smoke.
Eating this in childhood affects the growth of the brain .
But today I want to tell you about a new issue.
You must have been aware that in India, these days e-cigarettes have been prohibited.
The e-cigarette is a variety of e-cigarettes from normal cigarettes.
A kind of chemical smoke forms when nicotine substances are hot in e-cigarettes.
Like other cigarettes , smelling chemicals are mixed in it to prevent smelling from smelling .
Even if the father smokers at home, he's trying to prevent others from smoking... he wants children not to smoke cigarettes and beedi.
He doesn't want to smoke cigarettes at home.
He knows that smoking and smoking have a great loss to the body.
But the e-cigarette is totally different.
People don't know about e-cigarettes.
It's totally unaware of the accident, so sometimes e-cigarettes get into the house as if they were just funny.
You know, if someone smokes with us, we can know it with smell.
Even though cigarette packets in his pockets can be known with smell.
But this is not the case of e-cigarettes, so many children and youngsters don't know, or fashion, in the middle of their books, in offices, in pockets, are sometimes roaming in their hands, and they become victims of this.
Youth is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited by e-cigarettes in the country to avoid destruction of our youth, not finishing the dreams of families, not ruining the lives of children, and not roots in the society.
I urge everyone to leave the habit of smoking and not misunderstanding about e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, right
It is not meant that fit India is going to gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
Fit India has to stay away from it.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a magnificent country.
Many human beings are surviving on this planet.
India was the birthplace of abnormal people like that.
They are dedicated to others, not for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in the city on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for all Indians and Pope French will declare Mary Treasure as sacred on October 13.
The works done by Sister Maryam Treasure for the betterment of humanity in his narrow life of 50 years are examples of all over the world.
My dear countrymen, India is proud of the fact that when we celebrate Gandhi 150, as well as 130 crore people have taken a pledge to get rid of the single use plastic.
India is in the forefront of the world in terms of environmental protection, so the entire world looks at India now.
I am confident that you will also be part of the mass movement to avoid single use plastic on 2nd October.
In every place, people play their role in their own way.
But a young man in our country has done a different movement.
When I turned my attention towards his activity, I called him and tried to know and understand his new way.
He said that the country and people can be beneficial.
Mr.
When I heard the word Plugging for the first time, it was a new word.
Perhaps this word can be used a little overseas.
However, in India, Republican Dalvi gave it a big propaganda.
Come on, let's talk to him.
Our India will move 130 crore steps in terms of liberation from the Integrated Plastics only once the 130 crore people have taken one step in this regard.
Ripudaman ji, thank you once again.
Congratulations to you, your team and this new idea.
I want to remember something later.
However, it is time for some to start training and to plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, you will remember that by 2022, you should travel to 15 places of India.
Make a plan to stay at least one night or two nights in at least 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of various festivals of India with diversity.
Yeah.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should be kept in mind that people do not have any accident or fire brigade.
We need to take precaution.
Together with enthusiasm, we can celebrate festivals with new dreams and new visions.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Salute to my dear countrymen.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to directly interact with the kids from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of India at a function organized by the Times Group's successful Karnataka Day celebrations on Children's Day.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions in the country.
Congratulating Kirti Hegde from Uttarakhand, Digital India and Smart City programmes, the child says that we have to change our education system, and nowadays children don't like classroom reading, and they like to know about nature.
If we give children information about nature, perhaps it will be beneficial in future to protect the environment.
Rida Nadaf, a child from a place named Laxmaneshwar, says she is proud of being the daughter of a soldier.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers.
And it's very natural to take pride if the army's daughter is too much.
Irfan Bagum from Calburgi writes that school is 5 km away from home, so it's late to go out of the house and return home.
That's why I don't want to spend time with friends.
But I liked the newspaper that I didn't want to get the letters to me, so I could read the letters.
I have a good experience.
Ladies and gentlemen, today is 2611.
26 November is our Constitution Day.
In 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India was adopted on the same day.
The Constitution came into force on 26 January, 1950, so we celebrate that day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember members of the Constituent Assembly.
They have been working for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
It is a matter of pride for those who read about this discussion that what was the thought of those dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they have worked to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery of slavery, they have shown how much discriminatory and long-term.
It's not an area of uncomfortable life, and there's no subject in nature.
Equality and sympathy for everyone is the sympathy of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in a true sense.
Whether it is citizens or rulers, we have to move forward with the spirit of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should be damaged.
Seventeen different committees have been constituted based on important issues in the Constituent Assembly.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He had a great role to play.
On December 6, on his birth anniversary, we remind him and bow down regularly.
Baba Saheb's contribution to enriching and strengthening the country is unforgettable.
15th December is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's holy day.
Sardar Patel has become a fertilizer man from a farmer's son and has made a very extraordinary act of encouraging the country in a trading.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
The advisory committees were headed for the welfare of fundamental rights, fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
He recalls and bows to brave citizens, police and security personnel and all those who lost their lives that day.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is taking a terrible form in every part of the world as a day-to-day event.
We have been suffering from terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is a challenge to humanism.
This is the land that Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi gave the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism make strong efforts to weaken our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be more aware of the human powers.
My dear countrymen, we all celebrate the Naval Day, the Naval Force Day in December.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the river.
This country has an incomparable relationship with our land and the ocean.
If we look at history, we were considered to be the strongest navigator of the Chala Naval Force during the period 800-900 years ago.
In the development of the Cholasam Empire, their vessels played a major role in making them the then economic empowerment.
Several examples of the movements and exploration journeys of the Chola Navy can be seen in partnership.
Some people might know that most of the naval forces in the world have given women in warships for a long time.
However, in the Chola Navy, it was also 800-900 years ago, many women had played a very important role.
Women also participated in the war.
The Chola rulers were well aware of the construction of the ship.
When we talk about the Navy, who can forget the capabilities shown by him in making the Navy by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
Konkan beach was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Golden Fort attached to Shivaji Maharaj were on the sea or surrounded by the sea.
The Marathi Navy was waiting for the security of these forts.
There were big ships and small boats in the Marathi Navy.
They were capable of attacking any enemies and protecting the country from enemies.
How don't we remember Kanhoji Angrey when we remember the Maratha Navy
He brought the Marathi Navy to a new height and set up camps of the Marathi Navy at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed its patronage on various occasions, on the eviction of Goa, or on the India-Pakistan war of 1971.
When we talk about the Navy, the war is visible, but the Indian Navy has come forward in humanitarian matters.
Sumitra, a ship immediately helped rescue the people and delivered many people who were involved in fishing safe from the ocean to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year, three vessels of our Navy arrived and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a business ship was carried out in West Galf, INS reached Trikund for help.
Whether it is to deliver healthcare to Fuji, or to take immediate rescue operations, our naval forces have been doing a proud job to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country, and we are always proud and proud of our security forces.
Every Indian bows to our soldiers in the name of bravery, bravery, valour, bravery and sacrifice.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for 125 crore people.
Flag Day is celebrated every year on 7th December.
This is a day to honour and honour the soldiers of the country.
I am glad that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to organise a programme from 1st to 7th December, to inform people about the soldiers of the country and to make people aware.
Every week, children and adults must wear the flag.
There must be an endeavour to respect the army in the country.
You can call the soldiers in schools and colleges and get information about the army.
Let our new generation change this as a good opportunity to get information about the army.
This opportunity is to provide funds for the betterment of all the soldiers of our armed forces.
This money is used to rehabilitate the families of the soldiers who were gained in the war as a military welfare board for the help of the injured soldiers.
We can also contribute to their well-being.
I want to say something to our farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
What we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is completely connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there's no yellow earth in this world.
I'm scared of thinking.
We have already thought of this in our culture, so we have been aware of the importance of the earth since ancient times.
On the one hand, there is a natural effort to contribute to the land of agriculture, devotion and gratitude on the other hand, on the other hand, scientific projects were part of life to keep the soil nutritious.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to the earth and to protect the soil in scientific manner.
We are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are interested in modern sciences and are trying to take appropriate decisions.
I have heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorond Block of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The production capacity of soil was slowly decreasing.
Some of the farmers in the village recognized the seriousness of this situation and advised them to provide soil tests at the right time and how many other chemicals, micro-neutrients and bio-vegetarians.
You will be surprised to hear what was the result of the advice given by the information received from the soil health checks.
The quality of soil has also increased.
If we want to think about the crops, we should first think about the mother of the earth and if we are ready to protect the mother, then the farmers will feel that the mother of the earth will be watching us.
Our farmers have made more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to harvest it.
We believe in the mother-in-law, but do you think how harmful the mother's health is by chemicals like urea
In all scientific ways, the use of more than required urea has proved to be a serious loss to the mother.
Can our farmers take a decision to make our soil children a decision that the half of the urea used in agriculture today should be used during the 75th year of independence by 2022
We're all feeling global temperature and climate change.
There was a time before Deepawali.
Now the beginning of December, the winter is slowly moving down.
The 8-year-old unskilled child made Visil his weapon.
At five o'clock in the morning, he climbed the houses of the village and awakened the people by waking up and giving lessons to the people not to defecate in the open space.
Kumhari village is free of open defecation because of this child who has gone to 30-40 households every day and taught about cleanliness.
To encourage cleanliness, that little boy Tushar did an inspirational thing.
Our divine brothers and sisters are determined, capable, brave.
We get to learn something every year.
Today they work well in all fields.
Whether in sports, in any competition or in any social step, our divine people are not behind anybody.
You all remember that our divine players had won 4 medals in the Rio Olympics and the TV-20 crickets of the blind were champions in the world.
Different types of competitions are being held across the country.
Last day, seventeenth National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and showcased their skills.
One of them is Gigger Tucker from Gujarat and 80 of his body does not have muscles.
He was elected to the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 Para swimmers trained in the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salute to Jigar Tucker... and I convey my best wishes to him.
Today, Divyangjans can reach any area and are particularly aware of the opportunities.
It is our endeavour to be capable of all of the country and to form a society that is inclusive.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
This day the prophet was born by Hazarat Mohammad Saheb.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I think it's a matter of collaboration and change.
The elders in our village will always say.
Forget sorrows, don't forget the joy.
Can you surely contribute to this
Come on, let us share good news on the Narendra Modi App, on the MiGOV or on social media in Positive India (Hastag Positive India).
Remember the events inspired by others.
Remembering good things, there will be a feeling of doing good.
I'm gonna be able to do good things.
We can unite the strength and consequences of this unity.
There's a chance to tell you a lot.
PM on October 29, 2017
The sun and water are important in the Chhath Puja, but the utensils and cattle made of bamboo and earth are essential to worship it.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will honour and worship the creators.
But it gives us the message of worshipping those who are sure that Chhath Puja ends.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
The entire house is cleaned before Chhath and people share with great enthusiasm in the banks of rivers, lakes and ponds, pilgrimage places, i. e.
The celebrations of Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja, Environment Protection, Disease Reduction and Acquisition are celebrated.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
You might be happy to hear that there was so much business in a store in Khadi and Handloom.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Cooperation has increased by about 680.
The total sale of Khadi and handicrafts has increased by about 90 percent this year compared to last year.
Today, it shows that young people, women, people of all ages like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how much benefits have been given to the families of the poor and the families working in the handloom.
He says we also remember our brave security forces.
I think we'll get home sweets to the soldiers.
Once again, I got the privilege of celebrating Deepawali with the brave security personnel on the border.
This time, I had an unforgettable experience of celebrating Deepawali with the security personnel in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are looking at the country, honouring all the soldiers of our security forces for the war, dedication, sacrifice and sacrifice, for all the countrymen, by straightening the difficult and difficult situation in the border.
If we get the opportunity, we have to listen to their proud stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces are not only in our borders but also playing a vital role in establishing peace all over the world.
They are enhancing the interest of Hindustan all over the world as a Peacekeeper of the United Nations.
UN Day was celebrated all over the world on 24th October last day.
Everyone recalls the efforts of the UNCC to establish peace in the world and their active role.
We consider the Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
With this belief, India has been actively participating in various important initiatives of the United Nations since the beginning.
India has always given importance to women's equality and the Human Rights Declaration of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was decided at the outset that all men were born free and equal and as a result of the efforts of India's representative Hamsa Meta, the pledge was recognised that every man was born free and equal.
Looks like this doesn't seem very uncomfortable, but there's a healthy thinking in it.
The peace missions of the United Nations are the largest contribution of India to the United Nations.
India has always participated in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Some of you know this for the first time.
More than 16000 Indian security personnel have served in UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand Indian soldiers are connected to the peaceful peace of the United Nations, in which India is the third place in the world.
By 27th August, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 missions in 71 peacekeeping camps across the world.
These missions were carried out in various parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Lavos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labour and Sudan.
In Kongo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 Indian Army hospitals were treated and rescued innumerable people.
The security forces of India not only saved the people there in different countries, but also their minds through mass defence measures.
Indian women have also played an important role in establishing peace.
Many people do not know that India is the first country to send women police teams to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This initiative of India is inspiring to the nations all over the world.
After that all the countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to hear that India's contribution is not only in peacefulness, but also training the Peacekeeping Group in about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gaudh Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace missions are not simple.
Our security forces have to work on crossing the remote areas.
You'll have to live among different people.
We need to know and understand different environments and different cultures.
You must change yourself according to the local requirements and environment.
Who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria while remembering our brave United Nations peacekeepers today
Every Indian will be proud to remember him.
At the age of seventeen in 1989, he became the Operation Force Commander of Namibia and served the freedom struggle of that country.
General Timeya, the leader of the Indian Army, guided the United Nations Peace Day in Cyprus, hoisted his best for peace.
India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony all over the world as peaceful.
It is our belief that everyone should live with peace and harmony and move forward to create a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage was blessed by the great people who served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedit, whom we called Bhagini Divided, was one of those extraordinary people.
Although Margaret Elizabeth lived in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda gave her the name of a humiliation.
The word 'Nivedita' was completely dedicated.
Afterwards, they dedicated themselves to the name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to dedicate their lives to the service of the poor, with the influence of Swami Vivekananda.
Sister Nivedita's heart was saddened by the attacks in the British rule.
Not only did the British slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They have been constantly trying to create untouchability in our country by showing our culture.
Bhagwan reiterated the pride of Indian culture.
The renowned nationalist and Tamil poet, Subrahmanya Bharati's daughter-in-law, is famous as a revolutionary woman empowerment.
It is said that Bhagwani is inspired.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, a great scientist who was disciplined by Bhagwan, worked in collaboration.
They helped the research of Bose through articles and conferences.
Indias unique beauty is that spirituality and science are mutually fulfilment in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandra Bose are the strongest examples of this.
Hundreds of people died in 1899 when a horrific plague spread in Kolkata.
The SISTER envisaged the work of purification in the runs and roads without taking care of their health.
Sister was a woman who came out to serve the poor, even though he could live a comfortable life.
With their inspiration from this sacrifice, people came forward to cooperate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First, on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, I extend my best wishes to all children.
Children are the greatest heroes in the creation of New India, the dogs.
Your complications are correct that the disease that had already happened to the elderly and the disease that has happened in the evening of life has started to appear in children.
It's surprising to hear that children are infected with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are a lifestyle disorder .
The main reason for the occurrence of such diseases is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle and changes in food habits .
Community and family have to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you don't have to do anything special.
Small things in the right way, make them habitual and make it their own nature.
Instead of climbing up and down the lips, the kids have a stairs and swimming habit.
After dinner, try to take all the kids and walk a little.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
I'm saying it's easier for a person of any age.
It's easier to learn the unemployment, and it's easier to do anywhere.
It doesn't need special equipment or fields.
Several studies are being conducted on how much Yoga is doing in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives without seeing it as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have received good news from the games in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have won the country in different games.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey Crown in a good game.
Our sportspersons played a good game and that is why India could become Asia Cup Champions ten years later.
Earlier, India had won Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team and my countrymen for the support staff that helped them.
After Hockey, India also listened to good news in Batminton.
The Batminton Star Kidambi Shrikanth won the Open Crown for Denmark and honoured the Indians.
After the Indonesia operation and the Australian operation, Super-Series won the crown.
I extend my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and the pride of India.
Friends, this month, FIFA under 17 World Cup competitions were held.
The teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their talent in the football field.
I also had the opportunity to go to see a game.
The sportspersons and audience were very excited.
World Cup competitions were successfully conducted and all teams showed their best games.
Even though India cannot win the crown, the young players of India have embraced the hearts of all.
Festival of sports, including India, has enjoyed the whole world and the tournament was attractive and charming for football lovers.
The future of the football is bright.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, those who worked with them and all the enthusiastics.
Some are sending photographs of missions on the topic of small kids, some will be the story of youngsters' collective efforts.
There, a team of government organisation called Ecological Protocol Organisation (Ecosystem Protection Organisation) came out to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
During the two hundred days of this work, people continued to clean up the fort as a gathering without any tiredness.
I am surprised to see the picture that those who were disappointed to see that the surrounding dirt will be fulfilled and the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled. I would like to say that you will see the youth of the Ecological Protocol Organisation, their sweat, their enthusiasm and their vision in those active pictures.
Your disappointment, your belief.
This Bhagirathi effort for cleanliness is a miraculous example of beauty, collaboration and energy.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
By eating together, people's minds were motivated by unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the true life - to celebrate the name of God, to teach and to help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev was asked to tell him.
In the coming year, we are going to celebrate the 550th Uday Year of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come, let us move through the path of his message and his teaching lessons.
My dear countrymen, after two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
We all know that he has underground the modern Akhand Bharat.
If we travel through the extraordinary life of that great son of India, we can learn a lot.
His talent is in the process of guiding thoughts.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was slaughtered by the task of laying India in a drive.
He assured millions of Indians to be brought under the guise of a nation, a constitution.
He has the ability to take his firm decisions to overcome all the obstacles.
He determined a goal, surely moved to that goal.
He could have done this thing to make the country one.
Everyone was an equal nation in his vision.
I want to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has said that we are always inspiring.
These words of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring and inspiring to our vision of New India.
That's why his birthday is celebrated as National Integration Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of mutual emotion, Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, with a new imagination, with a new determination, you all will repeat the daily life.
My best wishes to the people of the country for fulfilling their dreams.
Three years have been completed after the launch of Mann Ki Baat programme, which you know through the sky.
Today's thirty sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can only tell those who send their minds from all corners of the country, but I get full treasure.
Most of them are inspiring to me.
Some of the things are about amending the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attracts attention to social problems.
When Mann Ki Baat, I recall what Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
Today, after three years, I am sure that social scientists, universities, researchers and media specialists will observe this and will bring light to light all the topics.
This discussion will be more useful in the future than Mann Ki Baat, and I am sure it will get a new brightness and new energy.
Mann Ki Baat said we should take as much as we want to eat and don't lose yourself.
However, the letters came from all corners of the country, from social organizations and youth that they were doing this before.
After that, how many people came forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
As a result, the Self-Fit with Dr. has become a big movement not only in India but also in the world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
All parents started taking selfies for their daughters.
All the girls started feeling that there is importance and importance.
Last day I was interacting with the Central Tourism Department...
I told those who came out of tourism wherever I went, I had to connect with India and send photographs.
Millions of photographs and pictures from all corners of weight have been a big source for those who work in the tourism sector in a way.
I was aware of how big things are being created in Mann Ki Baat.
The events of the last three years have emerged in psychological terms.
The country is progressing on the right path.
It's a big capital for any country, it's a big power.
I bow down to the people with my heart.
Once I was talking about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi was not a cloth, but an ideal.
Young people seem to have enhanced interest in tail khadi at home.
Khadi's sales have increased, so the poor's house is directly connected to work.
Khadi rebates are being given from 2nd October, which is very low.
This will strengthen the poor in our country and we will do it.
This kind of interest in Khadi has increased the enthusiasm to think about Khadi in a new way for those working in Khadi sector and those associated with Khadi in the government.
How can we bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how can we bring solar-catery
The ancient heritage has been for 20, 25, 30 years... to think about how to revive it.
We have collected several kinds of activities.
Many people have created job opportunities.
The Khadi Village Industries Division in Pampore, Kashmir revived its training department which has been locked up and has a lot to contribute to the region.
The resumption of this training centre will help the new generation to create new products and grow innovative ways.
Ordinary people and others have started offering Khadi products as gifts.
We can directly realise how a thing is naturally encouraged.
My dear countrymen, we all decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the Swachhta Festival 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhi.
It is said that through cleanliness, people will be connected to people.
Our Honble President started it and the country joined it.
Today, the elderly people, men and women, cities and villages, have become part of the Swachhta Diwas.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all sections of the country have considered this as their business and everyone is associated with it.
Whether the sportspersons are in the field of sports, the people of the cinema, the education sector, the schools, the colleges, the universities, the workers, the workers, the government workers, the police, the soldiers and the soldiers are associated with this.
There has been a change in public places to prevent others from polluting public places, where some of the workers have started feeling stressed.
It is a matter of great pleasure that during the first four days of the campaign of Swachhta Hi Seva, more than 75 lakh people have joined me with more than 4000 initiatives.
This time, we're cleaning somewhere, others' attention to not being dirty...
But if hygiene is a habit, then it must be an emotional way.
This time, there were fishes as well as Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachhta related articles.
Thousands of children have come to colorful pictures.
I don't forget to thank the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They pursued this birth very sacred.
They joined them in their own way and contributed immensely to creating a healthy environment.
A few days ago, somebody had focused on the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
Their Brand Ambassador has made Shri Nagar Nadda Bilal Dar on sanitation, while talking about Brand Ambassador, you will think that he will be a hero in the field of sports.
On seeing plastic, polythene, useful bottles and other turtles, Bilal removes it and makes some income.
Bilal's Copper Ration gave a vehicle and gave the uniform, he went to other areas and told people the lessons of sanitation, inspired them and remained behind them until they see the results.
He's inspired by all those who are interested in cleanliness, even though Bilal Dar is a little child from age.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of todays history and when I talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
This is the month of October to remember many great men.
In the month of October this year, people from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who have suffered a lot for the country, have been leading us, guided us to the path of the 21st century.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the center of all these great men
There was a common thing - live for the country, do something for the country...
Not only did Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji and Deendayal ji live a long time away from the territories of power, but sensitivity lived with life and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyaya and Mahatma Gandhi used to speak of the man who stood at the end of the society.
Sardar Sab united the country.
We have to move forward to unity.
You know the diversity of this India, touch it, smell it.
You will see that these varieties of our country will work as a big school for the development of your personality.
It's holidays, the days of Deepawali... we have a habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
The tourist journey is natural.
But we don't see our country, we don't know the varieties of the country, don't understand, but it is a matter of imagination that we have started going abroad with the effect of diversity.
The people of western India don't know what is in the previous India.
Our country is full of varieties.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilakan, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalamji visited India, they had a new inspiration to see, understand and die for India.
All these great men walked in weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to self-reliance India.
As a student, can we try to integrate our different states, communities, communities, their traditions, their traditions, their dresses and their food habits to learn their understandings
Tourism does not seem to be valuable, but we are trying to understand it as a student and become part of it.
In my own experience, I have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of the country.
I've got a chance to stay in more than 450 districts...
The experiences of those journeys are very beneficial to me when I am responsible in this India today.
I'm comfortable to understand things.
I urge you not only to realize the unity of this vast Indian diversity as an instrument, but also to feel the treasure of our immense strength.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of foods are there
You'll never have to repeat it every day.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism sector.
Not only do you want to go out of the house during this holiday, you don't want to get off for a change, go to know and understand something.
Includes India and incorporates the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous by these experiences.
The limits of your thinking will be widespread.
Who's greater than experience
Normally, from October to March is the time for travel.
People are traveling.
I believe that if you go this time, you will take my invitation forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share pictures.
Please send a picture on the subject of Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you can intervene with the people at the place where you're going, send your pictures.
Not only buildings, but also pictures of natural beauty, but also people's lives.
Write good reports about the journey.
Send to Mai Gavi, send to the Narendra Modi App.
I am sure that the seven best tourist destinations in your state are being discovered and all Indians know about those seven places or seven things will be very good to encourage tourism in India.
If you can, go to those seven places.
Can you get some information about it
Make films about such good places, make video and encourage them to be motivated - the government will recognize the varieties you find.
You can also be inspired to encourage tourism from October to March.
I invite you to it.
I'm deeply impressed.
I'm a man like you.
One thing that happened last day will be kept in mind and people have seen a divine example of women's strength and patriotism.
Its extraordinary significance is that the husbands and sisters of the Freedom and Fund served Bharat Mata and sacrificed.
Can we imagine what would be emotional if we didn't live at this young age
But Balidani Colonel Anand Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik made this difficult situation straight in mind and joined the Indian Army.
He trained for 11 months and changed his life to realize his dream.
His wife's fund took a firm decision and joined the army.
It is natural for all people to be proud of these virgins.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They are inspiring and consciousness to millions of people of the country.
My best wishes to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our youth during the Navratri Festival and Diwali.
FIFA under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure the football will be all around.
The interests of all generations will increase to the football.
My dear countrymen, it's a new night.
It's time to worship Durgama Bai.
The atmosphere is full of pure and sacred smell.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
It is considered a festival of Shaktisadhana.
On the 75th anniversary of Indias independence in 2022, let us move forward by making a framework for five years to realise the dreams of freedom fighters, the determination, size, efforts and determination of 125 crore people.
Thank you a lot.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 27th August, 2017 at 11 o'clock in the morning
I salute my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, when the country drowns in the festivals, on the other hand, it is natural for the country to be vulnerable by listening to the news of violence from any part of India.
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who has lived for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and mutual respect, which is part of our minds.
We have been saying that Ahimsa is Paramodharma since childhood.
In the name of faith, I had said from the Red Fort that it would not allow violence, be it religious beliefs, political beliefs or traditions.
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, there are provisions for justice for all persons.
Anyone who follows the path of violence, whether it is a person or a society, will never allow this country, and no government will allow it.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and this diversity is not just in food, lifestyle and innovators.
We can see varieties in all the heads of life.
Our festivals are also diverse.
Even if we look at the cultural heritage of our centuries old, we can see that there will be no observation of historical events in 365 days, even if we see our cultural heritage.
If we look at all our festivals, we can also see a festival that does not connect with the time boundness of nature.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to farmers and are directly associated with fisheries.
Today, when I talk about the festivals, I would like to tell you 'Mitchamy Dukdam' for the first time.
Yesterday, the celebration of 'Sanvasari' took place in the Jain community.
The festival of 'Tourism' is held in the Jain community in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival of 'Tourist' is the anniversary.
It's really a wonderful tradition.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and maternity.
This is called the 'Khamavani' festival and this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other by saying 'Michami Dukadam'.
In our scientific scientific sciences, the pardon of forgiveness has been described as a humility.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specificity of a strong man.
Referring to the significance of forgiveness in the play he wrote, "Mercy Is Tives Blast, It Blast, Hym Date Gives Him Date Tax", which means that he is forgiving and forgiving is the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations last ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganesh Festival.
Now there is a time for Honour in Kerala.
One of India's centenary celebrations, Honor is the main festival of Kerala.
It is important with social and cultural importance.
The Honour showcases the rich cultural glory of Kerala.
This festival brings a message of love and harmony in the society and brings new enthusiasm, new ambitions and new faith to the people.
Now this festival is becoming a part of encouraging tourism.
New night festivals in Gujarat and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become one of the attractive tours in a way.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners like this.
We need to think about what we can do in this matter.
Edul Suha will also be celebrated after a few days.
Festivals are a symbol of devotion and faith and we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the deliberations of modernization are changing.
Different types of experiments are being carried out in every family.
Look how big it is, how happy it is.
As I said, the country is full of intellectual awakening.
It's very happy to know about somebody's new discovery.
Someone has said that an engineer has collected some kind of soil and added it so that it is training to make a Ganesh idol.
When a little skin burns that smell in water, it melts quickly in the water.
He didn't stop with this.
Three years ago, Swachhta Abhiyan will be launched on 2nd October.
Its consequences are visible.
The toilets were 39 percent and now it is 67 percent.
More than two lakh 30 thousand villages have been declared to be freed from open defecation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water came, the waste was spread all over.
We can create a clean environment all over the country.
After construction of toilets, you can add your name to the portal and the family that helped you.
You can write articles in different languages, there's no age.
You can make short films on your mobile.
You can make a two-three-minute long film that inspires cleanliness.
In any language, it can be a silent picture.
Please act as participants.
You will see how bright it will be on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
After 15 days of sewerage, after the Swachhta Hi Seva programme, on 2nd October, we will be able to enjoy the honour of paying homage to the honourable Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I want to explain a special duty to you.
I am waiting for your message as much as you want to wait for Mann Ki Baa.
I'm waiting with curiosity because I have a chance to learn everything you're saying.
There's a chance to change the things I do.
I'm gonna use your little things to think with a new vision.
"Prime Minister, I'm speaking impatient from Pune.
I once went to Mall for shopping with her.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari, spending 450 rupees for a piece.
However, he asked the driver of the auto captured to go to Mall about five rupees.
On the way back, the vegetable was purchased and the price was supplied by Rs 4-5.
I feel very bad.
We are once in big places without asking questions about the price, but we urge the brothers and sisters who are dependent on us for a few rupees.
They are unbelievable.
You must talk about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Ma'am, I'm grateful to you for sending a great message through this heartfelt phone call.
I am sure my people will surely give up this habit to the poor.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the sports day will be celebrated across the country.
This is the birth anniversary of Major Dhyanchand, a great Hockey player, who showed Indrajalam in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey were sustainable.
This is because of the desire to connect our country with younger sports.
Sports must be part of our lives.
If we consider ourselves the youngest country in the world, we must see our children in the games.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness and personality.
What more do you want
Sports are in a way an important medicine for the unity of minds.
Friends, The Ministry of Sports has prepared a Sports Talent Research Portal to explore and empower them.
Any child from all over the country who has made some benefits in the field of sports can apply video and video if you want to have a biodetta in it.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports will be trained by selecting sportspersons.
Let us tell the youth that there are 17 World Cups in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home.
We are all inspired by the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls working in the Navy.
These six girls went out of the sea on a small boat called INS Tarini.
It's called the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months around the world.
These six kids will dare walk in the midst of the waves in the ocean and this is the first such journey in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we also celebrate the Teachers Day.
He was the President.
But he said he was a teacher himself.
He was a scholar, a guide, a President of India, but he was an exciting teacher in all senses.
I bow to him.
The great scientist, Albert Einstein, said that this is the highest art of the teacher to wake up in creative expression and knowledge, that is, the greatest quality of a teacher's creativity and knowledge among his students.
Why don't we take a decree when we celebrate the Teacher's Day
Can you organise a campaign as a mission
Teach to Transform, ducate to mpower, teach to emerge changes, learn to empower and guide.
Can you take this mission forward with this determination
Anybody should take a resolution for five years and guide them to achieving it and pleasure in winning it within five years.
Besides, an atmosphere should be created by our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk of transformation in our country, the teacher will be remembered in the society as we talk about mother in the family.
Teachers have an important role in making changes.
One thing that can change the lives of somebody through a comfortable effort must be done in the lives of all teachers.
If we work together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Let's move with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Your Majesty.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in the economic inclusion programme and related social projects.
I would like to ask you to say that after three years of this Jan Dhan Yojana launched in 2014, India is more economically safe and more robust and empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers and villages
This move was launched on 28th August, 2014 as a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be held on 28th August tomorrow.
The bank accounts were opened by connecting 30 crore new families.
It's more than the population in many countries of the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested about Rs.
The Pradhan Mantri Jeevanjyoti Bima Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are giving birth to a new faith in the lives of those poor people today with a discipline of one rupee or three rupees.
When the poor was in danger, some families got Rs. 2 lakh in a few days due to insurance.
They will be inspired by it and hundreds of examples have come to me about the changes in the lives of a person, how new energy is filling, how new faith is filled.
They can inspire such people and inspire a new generation.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes.
Thank you a lot.
The specialty of the human mind is that the rainy season attracts the mind.
As a result of changing climate and climate, a very negative situation arises.
Over the past few days, people have suffered in some parts of India, especially in Assam, northeastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with the spirit of service are making efforts to help people in this situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, all the soldiers, Air Force, NDRF and Armed Forces are working with livestock in helping the victims of floods.
People's life becomes very fragile due to floods.
The NDRF team was supplied.
Climate cautions are almost sufficient due to the development of technology and the progress made in the environment.
As per the climate signs, if the timelines of our activities are gradually transformed into a habit then we can prevent great losses.
When I am ready for Mann Ki Baa, I see that the people of the country are preparing it more than me.
I heard your speech on the Chartered Accountants Day, which affected me a lot.
Similarly, last month, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was launched.
I am glad to hear that there is a dearth of goods in the north-eastern regions, in the remote hilly areas, in the forests, a person who lives in the forests, I am afraid, and now I have started to understand things.
The time to come from one place to another is less and the number of highways is less.
The speed of tracks has reduced pollution.
The goods are quickly targeting.
The simplicity of this transformation has been transformed and the simplicity of this transformation has been transformed from one way to the other and new registrations have taken place which has led to a new faith in the entire country.
However, I am confident that once again, economic experts, management experts and technologists will look at Indias implementation of GST as a model in the world and make a research.
There will be a case study for all the universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has brought us to the height of success that it has been successfully implemented in such a big country with the participation of millions of people.
The world must learn about this.
All the States have shared in implementing this GST and are responsible for all the States.
All decisions were taken by the States and the Central Government together.
The great dream of 'One Nation-One Tax' was successful.
I can see how the officers from the village to the centre worked with dedication, how much harmonious atmosphere was created between the government and the traders and the consumers and how much contribution was made in increasing their confidence.
I convey my heartfelt appreciation to all the Ministries, all the departments and all the officers of the Central and State Governments in this regard.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias social power.
It's a history.
In a way, it is a movement of social reform.
I once again salute the millions of people of the country for achieving such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
The country was free on 15th August, 1947.
In the month of August, many events are related to the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered together with the freedom movement, tried and suffered.
The sheep of history inspire us to build a grand India.
India's people's minds were united against the British rule.
Millions of Indians were dedicated to fighting life with the mantra of working or die as per Mahatma Gandhi's aspiration.
Millions of youngsters of the country have studied and have studied books.
They came down after hearing the joy of freedom.
On 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi had called for India Chhodo, but all the big leaders were embraced by the British Government and at that time the second generation led by Dr.
The great men like Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan were the tribes.
There was a population behind all this victory, people's capability, people's vision, people's fighting.
The endeavour from 1857 to 1942 brought the Sammelan to its valour in 1942.
Within 5 years, in 1947, the British had to leave India.
I want to connect you with this math.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
For about 70 years.
The governments have come.
The success took place.
Hopes are awake.
As in 1942 to 1947, there were decisive years to achieve the vision.
From 2017 to 2022, we have come forward for five years to achieve the visionary goal and we can celebrate 15th August, 2017 as a moment of vision.
Let's make millions of determinations.
Try to fulfil millions of determinations.
We have to take a pledge.
2017 must be our dream year.
This must be part of the vision of August.
Today, it is not necessary to work or die but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and body to achieve success, to live with this dream and to work.
Any decision that can be made in the next five years.
Scientific discussions can be organised for youth organisations, student organisations, government organisations etc.
Let's take forward new ideas.
Where do we go as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
Through technology, come forward with video, post, blogs, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a people.
The uit India uit India uits for the youth in the Narendra Modi App.
This issue is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce the freedom fighters.
You must give a broad publicity and bring it to the people.
This time, I invite you to know your suggestions on MyGov App or Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell you about it in time as long as I get it on August 15.
I guess it's 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I want to say one more thing today.
There is a social economic science in India's economic system.
We'll never pay it.
Our festivals and festivals are not just an opportunity to enjoy.
Our festivals and celebrations are the efforts of social reform.
The person and society are connected to each other.
Thousands of jobs are associated with this festival, including those who make Rakhis, sell Rakhis and sell sweets.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn the lamps for Deepawali - it is not only a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration or adornment of houses.
It is directly connected to the poor families that build soil streams.
But today, when I talk about the festivals and the economic conditions of the poor related to them, I want to talk about the environment.
I think some people of this country are aware and more active.
Over the last one month, people who are aware of the environment have written letters to me.
They have requested that on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, people should predict the environment friendly Ganesh. People should now have the opportunity to set up a plan to prefer Ganesh with soil.
I'm grateful to those awakening citizens.
This time I'm saying this before.
I'm sure you'll be with me in this.
This will help the artisans and poor artists, and they will get jobs by creating idols.
The belly of the poor will be filled.
Come, let us connect our celebrations with the poor, connect the poor with the economic fate of the poor and make the joy of our celebrations the economic celebrations of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country on various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching the girls of our country be it the education sector of the country or the economic sector or the sports sector.
We, the people of this country are proud of our girls.
Last day, our girls performed well in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, the conflict appeared.
I observed things in another way in that conversation.
I said, Look, there is a lot of hope in this period of media.
If you win or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore people.
Youngsters in the country, especially our girls, are actually working towards enhancing the size of our country.
I once again congratulate the youngsters of the country, especially our girls, and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I recall the August Revolution, I recall 9th August, and I recall 15th August.
2022 recalls the 75th anniversary of independence.
Ensuring all the citizens of the country to make plans for five years for dreams.
We have to take the country to new heights.
Come on, let's go together. Let's do something.
Let's move forward with the belief that the future of the country will be bright.
The climate is changing.
The climate is comfortable due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
Cold winds after rain relieved from heat in the last days.
Whatever the busyness in life, however stressful in your life or in your normal life, the rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated in many parts of the country with great respect and joy.
Now in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath has started celebrating the Rath festival.
Those who learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar would have been aware that he praised the temple of Lord Jagannath and his traditions because they include social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the God of the poor.
Some people might have known a word Jagarnet in English, which means nobody can stop.
If you look at the meaning of this Jagarnat, it seems that this word is turned back from Lord Jagannath's chariot.
We know from this that how Jagannathji's chariot journey has been honoured in his own way.
Everybody celebrated the holy month of Ramasan with sermons.
Now I'm here.
I extend my best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Rumsan is the month of a sacred gift, a month of joy sharing.
In this holy month of Ramadan, I remembered the inspirational thing that happened in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters coming around 3500 live in that small village and in a way, the sisters and sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Ramasan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
Expend 17 lakh rupees for the rest of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this sacred occasion of Ramsan an opportunity for the betterment of the society.
Every act of theirs is very inspiring.
The most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur open defecation free.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced.
I express my gratitude to these five States, the Governance, the authorities and the common people.
Then the habit of body and mind will change.
It's the same thing as cleanliness.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
It's a good thing in my mind last day, and I want to tell you.
The event is a part of Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What was the goal
Building 10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
All my dear countrymen will be happy to know that the work of 100,000 toilets has been successfully completed in 100 hours in collaboration with the common man and the government.
71 villages have become open defecation free.
In, through the knife and the sky.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today recalled the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of three years.
This warmth of light with democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not only a system but also a culture.
Attorneys Is the Prince of Liberty - Regular awareness is the value of freedom.
Continuous awareness about democracy is essential, therefore, the things that have hurt democracy have to be remembered.
And must move towards the direction of good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was a night of unforgettable democracies.
In a way, the government was making the country captive.
Tortured the voices of the opponent.
Shri Jaiprakash Narayan and other dignitaries of the country were in jail.
You're not able to escape the terrible shadow of the weather.
The newspapers have been unemployed.
Today, students from the press sector and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people towards democracy by recalling that period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem a year after announcing the supremacy and he described it in that poem.
My dear countrymen, all Indians are proud to be at the top of the world today.
On June 21, 2017, Yoga became the world.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the sun rays of the morning.
It's a Hindustani who doesn't feel proud of it.
It is not that Yoga was not before, but when Yoga was embraced by the drive of Yoga, Yoga became an eye to cover the world.
Most of the world's countries made Yoga Day an occasion.
On the top of the wildlife in China, people have done yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level at Machu Pipuil, a world heritage in Peru.
People did yoga in the shadow of the Effect Tower in France.
The event took place at 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a one-week long event was organized.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and U.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised at the United Nations Secretariat.
It was attended by UN officials and all the strategists from all over the world.
This time Yoga has once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, about 50,000 people have worked together and made a new world recade.
I also had the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our armed forces, including BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, have made Yoga a part of the work with their duty.
Some TV channels also preached it.
The Honble Prime Minister said that in recent times, he has said in Kerala, instead of giving bucks as gifts, good books should be given as a gift to memories.
It started in Gujarat during your regime, but in recent times it has been seen to be more useful.
Can you do anything
Can't the country do anything to enforce books instead of bucks
It's Khadi's handles to get incentives.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this programme continued, but after leaving there I left the habit.
But in this programme of Kerala, I was repeated again.
Now it's starting to put an instrument down.
We can gradually make it a habit.
Buck's age is very low.
You're gonna leave after buying it in your hand.
Welcome to Khadi's clause, however, the poor families will be benefitted.
Expenditure will also be low and that's why it will be used properly.
How many years have been, but Elizabeth's queen has kept the handles given by Mahatma Gandhi.
Several kinds of letters are available, many people are burning.
I want to tell you about it last day when I read a letter.
In the southern coast of Tamil Nadu, a family from Madurai sent me a fire.
I don't want to know what it was.
Considering the study of children, he thought of some economic activity and thought that the family would have some financial assistance.
For this, I took loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started selling some goods from the market.
That is, the government departments will look after the registered e-jam.
They're very interesting to write to me.
They said, "I got the money under the Mudra scheme, started doing business and added the list to me in e-jam and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office and from the PMO.
'I was also a new news.
They suggested what they bought in the PMO - two thermos and got 1600 rupees.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity to promote industrial innovation.
It is transparent, empowered, and introducing industrial innovation.
Government e-Market Place-jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also honour our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on the atmosphere.
Two days ago, ISRO-CartoSat-2 launched 30 or four satellites along with Series.
These satellites were from India and from 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This NANO Satellite of India will help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We remember that a few days ago, ISRO GISAT was successfully launched.
This was the weightest satellite in India's satellite so far.
The newspapers in our country comparison to the weight of the elephant.
It can only imagine what our scientists have done in the environment.
A thousand days of Mangalyaan Mission were completed on 19th June.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, this mission was aimed for a total of six months.
Today, India's Badminton player Kidambi Shrikanth won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the pride of the country.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics was given an opportunity to interact with the inauguration of the synthetic track.
Sportsman speed also increases as much as we are connected to sports.
Sports plays a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is immense in the overall personality development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If our family and children are interested in sports, they should be encouraged.
We have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and continuous excitement, all together this time is a new experience.
Once again, you're supposed to be supposed to have some other words in Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 28th May, 2017 at 11 o'clock in the morning
Today, when I'm talking to you, the holy month of Rumsan started.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, on the arrival of the Holy Month of Ramadan.
There is a lot of importance for prayer, spirituality and donation in the ropeway.
It is our country that believes in God, who denies God, who worships idols, who resists idols.
The art of living together in all ideologies and traditions of all kinds of devotions.
Religions, races, traditions and messages given to us are of peace, unity and harmony.
The sacred month of this Ramasan will help us move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
I am very happy to know that a lot of people have experienced me.
I was very excited to tell you yourself.
I couldn't read everything, I couldn't hear everyone's messages.
But I looked together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new words, some tried to learn new things from the YouTube, some tried to learn new languages.
I'm glad to hear you a phone call.
I'm talking to Diksha Katyal.
I had a reading habit.
But in this holiday I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, we came to know how many years of freedom fighters were in jail, how many sacrifices had to be made to achieve independence.
I am inspiring from Bhagat Singh, who had suffered a lot of sacrifices at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to convey to the new generation about this matter.
It is heartening to note that the new generation, our freedom fighters, and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
The last great men in prisons during the freedom struggle have done a lot of literary work.
Their threshold strengthened the freedom struggle of India.
Years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar once.
He went to see the Cellular Jail.
This is the birth anniversary of Veera Savarkar.
The Veer Sarkar wrote a book 'Masi Janmathe' in prison.
The poems were written in the prison wall.
He was locked in a small cell.
A Light and Soundo Show is very inspiring.
The people from all the states of India and all the languages used to sacrifice their lives by feeling Kalapani in this cellular jail in Andaman.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
What do you mean to connect with nature
To be connected to nature is to protect the best land.
It's better than Mahatma Gandhi's words...
Mahatma Gandhi often said, "We need to take care of the unknowing world" (One Most Care Ebowd E World One Winnot C) that is, we need to think of the unprecedented world where we cannot see.
Nature has a power.
You might have experienced, when you get tired, if you boil a glass of water on your face, how smooth it is.
If we open the windows of the house when we get tired, we'll feel a new feeling of breathing in the windows passing through the doors.
When we are attached to these five pupils built by the body, we have a new consciousness in our body, a new energy emerges.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care, we don't carry it into a stream.
When you come in contact with nature, you must remember whether there is a new consciousness inside you.
Therefore, the global campaign to connect with nature on June 5 must be a movement of each of us.
We have the quality of preserving our predecessor environment.
If we look at the environment, it will be beneficial.
It is the most important guidance of the environment that must be recalled that thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is said to be Prithvia.
It is said in the Vedas that the brilliance of ours is the cause of our land.
The earth is our mother, we're children.
Several festivals and ceremonies are connected to the environment in our country.
The spirit of nature is part of social life, whether educational or non-city, urban or tribal.
We're gonna make it a new word, and we're gonna have to explain new justice.
There are some remarkable reports from the States.
In most of the states, there is a big movement in the field of tree movement as soon as the rains begin.
Millions of trees are planted.
School girls, social organizations, government organisations and governments have moved ahead.
This time also we have to encourage tree movement and give our contribution to it, my dear countrymen.
June 21 is coming, June 21 is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
Within a very short time, the famous June 21 Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world and connects people with each other.
On one hand, many divisive powers are distorted in the world, while India contributes to the world.
Yoga has made the world rooted in a rod.
Today, as the body connects minds, minds and spirits, Yoga is connecting the world with each other.
Two days ago, I wrote letters to all the governments and all the leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and some awards have been announced.
He's gradually taking some steps.
I got some suggestions about this and I congratulate those who sent these suggestions.
It's very interesting.
Together, all three generations, together with grandma, grandmother, grandmother, mother, boys and girls, apload their pictures.
This meeting will be an opportunity to give a new dimension to Yoga today and tomorrow.
This picture will be tomorrow, tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant tomorrow's promise.
I invite you too.
There are more than three weeks left to become World Yoga Day.
This is a way of healthcare.
I invite everyone to be part of this.
When you assumed the responsibility of the Chief Servant, I got the opportunity to speak at the Red Fort in Delhi on 15th August and I spoke about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been going to different parts of India.
What are some people doing, where are Modi going
I'm grateful to him for seeing this thing.
You can understand this phone call.
Please, Modiji, I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I regularly see that people take special care of cleanliness on TV and community.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have taken Swachhta as a mission in a combined manner according to your request.
Not only the elderly, but also the children are also aware of cleanliness.
Children who blame on the streets are ruined somewhere.
The media also gives a lot of importance and a few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
It's more happy than that, even my journey is related to cleanliness.
There will be a habit of making the rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now it will be a big deal.
It's joyful to all those who want to be clean, inspiring.
When Modi ji decides on his journey, he must ask the invitees, where will cleanliness be at the place where he invites me
How many tons of turtles will dedicate you to me, I'll decide whether to come or not.
"The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, it is said to be an entrepreneur to create so many leopards.
How many people can be saved from diseases.
How big a humanitarian thing
Look at these leopards as wealthy, and see them as a wealth.
I don't see it just dirty.
If we start looking at these leopards in affordable manner, new methods of dirt transmission will be brought before us.
Youngsters associated with Startups will also come with new schemes and will come with new instruments.
In collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to initiate a big initiative on the issue of waste-made energy with the help of people representatives of the cities.
On June 5, the World Environment Day is going to provide suitable storages for collection of fertilizer and liquid in nearly four thousand cities of the country.
There are two types of leopards, one green and the other blue.
The kitchen wastes, green skins, food items, eggs and leaves are fluid-like, they should be put in green nests.
All these are beneficial in the field of agriculture and what do you remember in the greenery .
The second round is to put unnecessary bottles, iron components, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken dubbies, rubber commodities and all these things are in a way dry.
The entire responsibility was taken by Versova residents volunteers.
Brothers and sisters, Today, I am happy to tell you that the Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become an open defecation free area related to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
I congratulate all the people of Reasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, the number of current governments is going on everywhere in the newspaper or TV channels or social media for a month.
Three years ago, you took me as the chief servant.
A lot of servings, there were very many opinion polls.
I see this as a healthy thing.
This three-year programme has been transformed in all ways.
People from all walks of the society observed this.
This is a very good way of democracy.
The governments must be responsible in democracy, and the government has to calculate their functioning.
I thank those who know differently, greatly.
Efficient criticism strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for the nation awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, I have a good and bad impact on any common citizen.
As I said, as an ordinary citizen, I have an impact on it, that's important.
Two days ago, a study book on Mann Ki Baat was released by the Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker, and as a person, as a common citizen.
I am grateful to the Vice President and the Vice President for exploring Mann Ki Baat, and they have been in such a high position.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat was given a new head.
Some friends also discussed the work of the book on Mankiu Baat.
He said that he wants to make a schedule on the topics in Mann Ki Baat and gave a artistic form to Akbar Saheb Mann Ki Baat to showcase his love without paying a rupee reflection.
I'm grateful to Akbar Shahab.
My dear countrymen, the next time Mann Ki Baat says, the rains will come all over the country, the climate will change, the results of the examinations will come, the new study will start life... a new awakening and aroma will spread when rain comes.
In this environment, we can move ahead with nature's love.
My best wishes to you all.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 30th April, 2017 at 11.
Salute to my dear countrymen.
The curiosity of the children, the ambitions of the youth, the experiences of the adults...
Normally, it's people's nature to advise others.
On the train, when someone goes to the bus, if someone gets coughed, you'll do it immediately.
Advise me, say it's our nature.
First of all, when Mann Ki Baat's suggestions were received, he heard the voice of the advice and got something to learn, when the team felt that it would be a habit for a lot of people and that's why he was sending it.
But when we tried to observe it minutely, we really got filled with mind.
They're actually doing something more than those who say these words and those who try to reach me.
They are trying to do a better thing, according to their intellect, power and capabilities and the environment.
When I came to know about this, these suggestions are extraordinary.
I am sorry to waste food in Mann Ki Baat last time.
This is an example of how things happen in collaboration with the society.
Today's the end of April, the last day.
May 1 is the foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature has changed all the rules of play.
This time the heat of May-June in our country had to be felt in March.
When Mann Ki Baat has taken the initiatives from the people, some people have sent suggestions about what to do during this summer.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it will be very beneficial to repeat it at the right time.
Many friends starting from Karti are worried about birds.
They told me to put water in the utensils in the balcony and terrace.
Small children in the family are very excited about this.
Once they're careful about how to keep water, they'll go ten times a day, if they keep the utensils.
I'll take care of whether the birds come.
We think it's a game, but it's really a good experience to wake up in the minds of children.
He lived till the age of 103.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, Bohra Samaj Burhani Foundation launched a big campaign to save the breeds.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed approximately fifty thousand fireworks to the world.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes the newspaper giver, the milkmen, the vegetables and the postman, when we come to the door, forget to ask if we are summer or water, so busy.
Young friends, I want to tell you some things.
People from our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable situation.
Parents also raise them very safely.
But I want to tell you how to be a friend of your holidays.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities...
Sometimes see something on TV, or read in the book, or listen to the acquaintance... and feel that...
Please examine, let's get out of the cool winter.
If we are from the middle-class family, we're from a happy family.
You can never see the joy of playing in your life.
You have been wondering how much change will happen in their lives when the children leading such a life in the society get an opportunity to play with you.
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Go to the jungle.
Sometimes summer crowds will be organised, personality development chains will take place...
Several development works will be carried out.
Everyone will be busy in the world with the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
The other thing I said is about skills, you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competition.
It'll be hard to buy the highest roads and go to some coaching class on vacations, and the next exam will be in danger.
But keep in mind whether there is no humanity within and whether it is away from human qualities.
Can we take a little more care of skill development
Don't spend some time with him from the technology.
Learn some musical instrument, learn 5-50 words of a new language, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
Try to learn something you don't know, you must have some benefits.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a curiosity, understand, talk to the people, ask them... all this gives a different pleasure to see there.
Try and determine yourself.
Don't lose time for travel.
Go to one place and spend three to four days.
Then go to another place and stay there for three to four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Show me pictures where you're going.
Show your experiences through Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
The new generation has almost been freed from formats.
They don't need money.
They have started relying on digital transactions.
Did you think you could do this for wealth
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
You must have downloaded the BHIM App.
Your account will be invested ten rupees from the government.
If you can add twenty people a day, you can spend 200 rupees in the evening.
This will enable traders and students to earn.
The project is up to 14th October.
You have played a role in building a Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays and opportunities for money.
Introduce the digital.
Normally, there is an atmosphere of hatred with VIP culture in our country.
However, I have come to know that the government has decided that no matter how big a person in the country can roam around the car with a red light.
It was in a way a symbol of VIP culture.
The feeling is that the red light was on a vehicle, but it would reach the mind of the people and that the VIP culture was intellectually formed.
Now the red light has gone, so nobody has the right to go to the red light on the head.
I got a very interesting phone call.
People are worried about the red light.
The government wants to talk about the prohibition of the Red Bikan Light.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian has a level of VIP.
I was very proud of it.
Thank you for that.
It means that instead of VIP, EPI is important for everyone.
We'll work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It will give us energy, inspire.
This year we are celebrating the thousands of years of Ramanujacharya, 125 crore Indians.
We're supposed to be reminded of all these things for centuries.
Hundreds of other countries in the world may have been very important.
He turned away those who didn't touch the community through behavior.
Thousands of years ago, he tried to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are fortunate to be born in our society to eradicate the evils of our society in all ages.
When Ramanujacharya's thousandth birth anniversary, we are inspiring to wake up the idea that he is capable of organizing social unity.
The Union Government is launching a stamp tomorrow to remind Swami Ramanujacharya.
Swami Ramanujacharya is honoured and honoured.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance tomorrow on May 1.
The very few people know that we are buried with Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect that the workers have received today.
Baba Sahebs contributions to the welfare of the workers are unforgettable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, the great Karnataka saint and social researcher of the 12th century reminds Jagat Guru Basaveswar.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to illuminate his words.
In the twelveth century, he is deeply contemplating his teachings and his teachings in Kannada language.
In Kannada, he said, Kay Kave Kailas.
This means that you can reach Lord Shiva's blissful calass through teaching.
I mean, to get heaven through doing...
I'm often telling you that I'm trying to win.
I recall that Dattopant Tangdi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie Group, had reminded me of the importance of work.
Today, it is natural to remember Dattopant Tengadi when we talk about workers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People from all over the world relating to Lord Buddha will celebrate it.
The life of Ashoka in India is an excellent example of the journey of Buddha from war to war.
I am fortunate to see that this festival of Buddha Purnima celebrates the United Nations Wesak Day.
This time it's going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
His memories will be renewed.
My dear countrymen, efforts have been made to move ahead with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas (Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas) in India.
In terms of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, it is not only in India but also in the global arena.
Especially in our neighbouring countries.
India-South Asia Satellite Satellite will be launched on May 5.
The potential and relevant facilities of the satellite will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will help in creating a framework of natural resources, whether in the field of tele-medicine or in the field of education or in connectivity of deeper technologies, or in people-to-people contacts.
This is an important step in India to enhance cooperation with all South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
26th March is Bangladesh's Independence Day.
A historic struggle against injustice, a wonderful success to the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore's memories are traditional for us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also created the national anthem of Bangladesh.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive Nobel Prize in 1913, but also gave him the status of Nighthood by the English.
However, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who were killed in 1919 when the British killed in Jallianwala Bagh.
That was what had a child's mind at the age of 12.
The boy who laughed at fields and sports in his childhood made a new inspiration in the life of a cruel massacre in Jallianwala Bagh.
The child, who was 12 years old in 1919, is Shaheed Bhagat Singh, the inspiration of all of us and our dear ones.
On March 23, the English had to beat Bhagat Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, it was happy to serve Bharat Baba on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, and it was not dead.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three brothers and sisters inspire us today.
We cannot describe the legend of sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru by words.
Well, the British Empire was scared of these ears.
The jewellery was shut down, the whisperer was sure, but the British thought of what about them.
That's why he killed those who were determined to slaughter on March 24.
They did it unusually.
Afterwards, their body was brought to Punjab today and the British burnt it without any knowledge.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there, I felt like a specific tremor on that land.
I would like to tell the youth of the country that if you get the opportunity then you must go to the samadhis of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dat.
Freedom, its rapidity, its propaganda was an increasing era.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth in the battle revolution.
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhiji's thoughts and his style were clearly visible in Champaran.
Gandhiji returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the nation.
Today, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on the basis of what form of Mahatma Gandhi is in our minds.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... just two years...
It was just a beginning.
We can see how hard he has to suffer at that time, how much he's trying.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to identify Mahatma Gandhi's organizational capability and the capability to understand the common man in the country.
Through his behavior, Mahatma Gandhi was organised in front of the English Empire for fighting, inspiring the poor and illiterate people... to fight...
This is a wonderful strength that the Champaran Satyagraha shows us through which we recognize the grandeur of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a big study for any person who starts a common life.
This is the sure foundation of a New India.
New India is not a government concept, it is not an exhibition of any democratic party.
New India is an advocacy of 125 crore people.
This is the idea of how to build a magnificent India by composing 1. 5 billion people.
There is an idea, an excitement, a imagination, an aspiration.
They're doing it as if they were penetrating as silent servants.
There are many who go to hospitals every day and help patients.
You know, there's a lot that runs for blood donation.
If someone's hungry, there are many who think of giving them food.
We can say that our country is a magnificent man.
People's service is God's vision in our nerves.
If we look at it with socio-consciousness, it will be so powerful if we gather together.
When we talk about New India, we have to think about it, observe it and look through a different perspective.
If 125 crore people decide, if they decide the path with determination then the dream of a New India will be fulfilled in our dreams.
All this is not required by the budget, by the government through the schemes.
If we decide to follow the transport laws, if all citizens decide that my obligations will be obliged to be obliged, then all citizens will ensure that they don't use petrol or diesel one day a week...
You will be able to realize the dream of a New India in this country of 125 crore people.
This means that all citizens follow their civilizations and follow their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people have been participating in the Digital Payments Digital Revolution.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and people are slowly moving towards transactions without currency.
Several methods of digital payments have been made after the notice discontinuation programme.
The BHIM App has started for two and a half months, but about one and a half crore people have made it download.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
125 crore people, if they wish, don't wait for one year.
It's only six months.
We can do this in everyday life.
This will make the country a great service that you cannot imagine, and you will be brave in fighting against corruption and corruption.
Several Digital Melas have been organized to teach people this and to make people aware.
100 programmes are scheduled to be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There were also presentations.
About 125 million people have received gifts for the beneficiary.
Seventy thousand people received gifts for businessmen.
Everyone has decided to move forward with this method.
14th April.
The Digidhan Mela is going to be concluded on the occasion of Dr. Babasaheb's birth anniversary on April 14, as decided earlier.
A big event is being organised when a hundred days are completed.
There's an arrangement for mega hatred.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, we will spread the BHIM App.
Please play our role in reducing the purchases of payable payments.
My dear countrymen, every time when Mann Ki Baat comes from people, I am happy to get various suggestions, but every time there is a need for cleanliness.
This message was delivered by the eleventh grade learning girl from Dehradun, Gayatri, Honble Prime Minister, for the first time in winning this election with a large number of greetings.
I want to tell you my Mann Ki Baat.
I want to say that people need to understand how important cleanliness is.
I'm passing through a river every day, in which people drive a lot of leopards, destroy the river.
Ladies and gentlemen, see how painful a child studying in class II is in the destruction of the river.
The kid gets angry when he sees the leopards on the river.
I see this as a good sign.
Since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan, there has been a new awareness in the country.
The hatred of dirt is increasing.
Woke up, be active partnership, be born... it's important.
I want to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in my Mann Ki Baat today that the message of Gayatri is to be a message to all of us.
Everything that sees is filled in the plate, it can't eat all.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
When mothers call the children in our houses, they say, ma'am or ma'am, take it all the time.
Secondly, it is economically beneficial for the family to get a little benefit from this.
It's good to think for the society, but it's beneficial for the family.
I don't have to do this, but I urge you to be more awake.
I know the youth who are doing great things in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
Whenever you know it's a mixture, people call it, and they use it properly.
This teaching is the youth of our country.
We will see people like this somewhere in all the states of India.
We can be inspired to avoid eating their lives.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way for change.
Those who are cautious of health will always say - keep your stomach and your feet , keep your plate a little foot .
On April 7, when we talk about health, the world is healthy.
Universal Health coverage has been set by the United Nations by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but if the word means, some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
When a psychological atmosphere is formed, it begins to get rid of it.
The first mantra is to say it openly rather than stopping depression.
Tell friends, parents, brothers and teachers what your mind is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children in the hostel, will have more trouble.
It is the best of our country that we have lived in a family, a large family and a mutually beneficial family, which reduces the chances of depression.
Otherwise, if everyone doesn't go out together, I don't want to come, keep in mind whether to stay alone.
Let those who can openly speak to him have a chance to stay with him.
Smile and inspire him to speak, bring him out if he's in trouble.
It's a good way.
Disease of depression is the cause of physical and mental diseases .
Like diabetes, all types of diseases, depression is unsuccessful in fighting, daring and deciding.
If you don't open your mind in front of yourself, then take help from someone who has a neighbourhood service.
Help with your mind, share your sorrows.
If you try to understand the grief of others, you will have a new self-confidence within you.
You can reduce the weight of your mind by being connected to others, by helping someone without selflessness.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga helps a lot in liberating from stress, prevention of mental stress, attempt to enjoyment.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Last day, the central government had taken a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and welcoming them to increase their share.
The responsibility of the family is to take part in the economic responsibilities of the household and this is the reason for the injustice to the newborn.
Therefore, the central government took a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April, Ramnavami is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 9th April.
May the lives of these great men inspire us and become the strength to commit a new India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Representation, Representation of the Year and New Year, you all have many Mangalas in this New Year.
This is the time when the farmers will get the results of their teachings.
This new year is celebrated in many ways in different parts of our country.
The New Year is being celebrated in the form of a New Year in Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Chati-Chand for the Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Yashtra Puja in Awadh region, Jude-Seetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all in this new year.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has written on the App: Many people do not know the achievements of ISRO.
They say that 104 satellites have to be disseminated and information about interceptor missiles.
I express my gratitude to all of you for remembering India's proud achievement.
The role of technology and science has been marked in fighting poverty, preventing diseases, connecting with the world, gaining knowledge.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have made the opportunity to raise India's supremacy before the world.
We all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the last year.
ISRO has established a World Record at ShunyaKasham last day after the success of the Mars in reaching Mangalya in Mars.
Through ISRO Megadoutya, 104 satellites from different countries like America, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerlands, Egypt and India have been successfully transmitted to the atmosphere.
India is the first country in the world to create history by bringing together 104 satellites into the atmosphere.
It is a matter of great pleasure that PSLV is successfully launched for 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the history of India.
The cost-effective and capable environment Mission of ISRO is surprising all over the world.
The world has complimented the success of Indian scientists with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is the most important.
Some of our satellites have been pictured as soon as they arrived.
It's starting its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that our young scientists and our female scientists have led the entire mission.
This is an important part of the success of the ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
For the common man, they have always set their goal of bringing environmental science to the nation's service, and everyday, new weights are putting in their crowns.
India has successfully tested the Ballistic Interceptor Missile in the security sector.
You will be glad to know that the world's hard work has been achieved by four or five countries.
Scientists from India have shown this.
Even though the Mission aimed at India from a distance of 2,000 km, it has been achieved that the missile itself destroys it in the space.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific sciences.
In the development journey of man, curiosity has played a big role.
Efforts are being made to know the creations of the Brahman and the human minds.
New science, new technologies are born from it.
All the technologies and all the new forms of science are born to a new era.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hardship of scientists and scientists and many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation has to increase the aspirations of science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Scientists today become a cause for a new change in the lives of the future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "No science has fallen from the sky in a fragmented manner.
All sciences are developed and tied up on experiences.
The Prime Minister said, "I pray to all my hearts with the enthusiasm, teaching and dedication that led them in the search of modern scientists after the truth.
Science seeks to use the principles of the common man, how the media should be and what technology should be, because it is considered as the most important contribution to the common man.
Identifying such inventions, exhibitions, introducing information to the people, how such inventions can be beneficial to the common man, how to produce more and how its commercial use can be done.
Sometimes the problems show the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are being followed by technology.
In a way, technology becomes an integral part of our lives.
Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important in the past.
In particular, youngsters have become a habit of doing digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good luck.
In the last few days, our country has received a lot of support for the Lakhi Grahak Yojana and the Digi Dhan Business Yojana.
Approximately two months, sixteen thousand people get a prize of Rs.
Through these two projects, the beginning of the transformation of digital payments into a people-to-people in India was accepted throughout the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh beneficiaries have received a gift of Rs.
More than four thousand traders have received the awards of Rs. 50,000.

He was happy to write on the Narendra Modi App in Mysore and received a thousand rupees under the 'Lucky Grahak Yojana'.
Then I thought they were offering a thousand rupees I got, and I gave them the thousand rupees.
I am very happy and I am happy that your name and your work are all happy.
You've done an inspirational job for everyone.

On April 14, a big prize of Rs.
Now it's only forty-four days.
You don't have to do this in memory of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has already happened.
Remembering him, you must teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Teach us how money is being sold, especially the neighbours.
This time, on Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary, give special importance to Bhima App.
Go home and take everyone to 125 crore households to the BHIM App.
In the last two-three months, this campaign has been successful in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
Farmers in our country have produced foodgrains this year as a result of their hard work.
All the suggestions are that our farmers have improved all the previous records.
It appears that Pongal and Vaishakhi are being celebrated by seeing the crops in the fields of agriculture.
This year more than 2,700 lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor and about 290 lakh hectares of cultivation of different peases.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, a programme of senior officers from 23 States under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India was organised in Telugu.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's a proven thing.
If a six-sided family has a standard double toilet, it will be filled in about six years.
And then we can send the dirt back to the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste of the knot is completely smooth.
It's very safe to handle such a solid waste, and it's a very important curving NPK as a curve.
The farmers are well aware of the NPK curve.
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are very nutritive substances which are considered to be very good in the agriculture sector.
Like the government has taken these steps, others must have taken such measures.
Several departments are regularly organising Swachhta Day.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development will join the Ministry of Tribal Development and strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in the first dawn of March.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation is collaborating with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation on the second voyage of March.
We all know, whatever the citizens of our country do, the country will realize that the country has reached a new dimension and the confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I have always thought that the divine brothers and sisters are capable and determined, brave and imaginative.
We get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or climate science, women in our country are not behind anyone.
The country's name is being brightened by achieving the achievements and moving forward together.
Our women won silver in the Asian Ragbi Service Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to those players.
The world is celebrating Women's Day on 8th March.
Today, it's not just a government programme.
The thinking of the people has changed to the ancient practices that have been going on for years.
I'm glad to hear the news that the girl was born to be celebrated.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls has become a cause for social acceptance.
It has been learned that child marriages have been prevented through a special population in Gudallur district of Tamil Nadu.
So far, about 175 child marriages have been stopped.
Under the Shukunya Samridhi Yojana, bank accounts have been opened to more than 50,000 and more than sixty thousand girls.
Under the Convention Model in Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections have been included in the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' programme, along with organising village councils, the district government is making a lot of efforts to empower orphan girls and to ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organised for the education of girls in every village and every household in the household of Harghar Dastak.
Rajasthan, our child and our school, Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, launched a programme to re-establish and inspire the girls who have studied in the midst of education.
Overall, the Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao scheme has been taking various forms.
I see this as a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys the rainy season, on the other hand, there are festivals and fairs in every corner of India.
This will happen till Deepawali.
Perhaps our ancestors have been demonstrating the creation of cycle and economic and social life in a way that there is no tension in the society at all times.
In the past, we celebrated many festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to today's problems from Shri Krishna's life.
Despite all these significances, take the work of Sarathi in the battlefield.
Sometimes pick up the mountain, sometimes feed the leaves eaten.
I mean, Krishna feels a new thing.
So, while talking to you today, I pay my attention to two hymns.
One of the visionary cycles is Mohanan and the other is Mohanan.
The vision cycle-driven Mohan left the Yamuna coast and dwelled on the seashore of Gujarat in Dwarka city and Mohan, born on the seashore, reached Delhi on the banks of Yamuna in the last mile.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna by laughing in the midst of all the heights of life.
My dear countrymen, I'm talking about the 100th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
New paths of humanity and new Kirti pillars were set up.
Services, service moods and work towards service were always part of Mahatma Gandhi's life.
In his own lives, the examples of service have been forwarded.
It was the best person, society, humanity for Mahatma Gandhi.
He emphasized the importance of social collaboration everywhere in the Financial Family of Africa, whether in the Tolstoy Family or in the Sabarmati Ashram or in old age.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to bow down in many important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi had given importance to organisational consciousness with the spirit of service.
We have to bring the feelings of social service, social development and social organisations in our lives.
This is the true meaning of Mahatma Gandhi's consciousness.
There will be many such opportunities, and we will gather together.
But what is Gandhi 150
What can you think of sharing these efforts as a person
Imagine what values can be yourself.
There's Ladies Club.
Let's continue the work at the Ladies Club in modern times, but all the members of the Ladies Club don't work together.
You can do a lot of things.
Specify old books, distribute to the poor, give information.
130 crore people will have 130 crore concepts and 130 crore initiatives will be started.
My dear people, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
The salt satyagraha in Dandi during the freedom struggle was a great path.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to travel to any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
Wherever it can be - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Ardha Ashram, in Delhi, on the left hand of Mahatma Gandhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures on social media and others will be inspired by it.
This time, in the Indian pavilion of Venice Binale, there were exhibitions of great interest related to Gandhiji's memories.
Haripura Panels were particularly attractive.
You will remember that there was a congress conference in Haripura in Gujarat and that where Subhash Chandra Bose was elected President was depicted in history.
This art exhibition has a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Convention of the Congress, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan in 1937-38.
He wanted Gandhiji to showcase the art of the people of India through the art of life.
Nandlal Bose, along with his artistic constitution, was surprising.
Nandlal Bose visited villages near Haripura and finally brought some pictures showcasing the lives of rural India.
These valuable artists were a big discussion in Venice.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I urge all Indians to take some vision.
For the country, for the society, for somebody else.
This is the best, real and real thing that can be done by Bapu.
Our dear brothers and sisters of India, for the last few years, we have been organizing a programme that covers nearly two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on 11th September.
This time plastic must be given special importance.
On 15th August, I reminded you of how enthusiastic and enthusiastic that 1. 55 crore people had organised a mass movement for sewerage, and worked to get rid of open defecation.
Likewise, we have to stop the use of plastics that can be used only once together.
In this regard, there is great enthusiasm for all sections of the society.
Many of my brothers and sisters in business have put a board in front of the shop and they have written that those who come to buy the goods should bring the bag.
It can also benefit money and contribute to the safety of the environment.
This time, when we celebrate the centenary of Baba's birth anniversary on October 2, we will not only dedicate to him an Open Defecation Free India, but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass against plastic across the country.
Let's change the fuel.
What is more inspiration than Gandhiji
Ladies and gentlemen, our cultured languages are in a way knowledgeable.
We'll get what we want in our life.
I want to say a big thing through a cultured language.
It's a few centuries ago, but it's still very important.
It is a very good text - the sweet woman, the switched water, the switched switched off, the switched of the switched switched off, the water on the earth, the switch and the switch.
The fools call the stone a blood.
In our culture, Anna was very proud.
We've changed the knowledge about that.
Awareness of the need for nutrition is being transformed into a modern scientific way across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
As per this, in the days of harvesting, the services of the Anganwadis are collected from every corner of the people.
This cereal is used for making hot food for children and women.
After this, the person becomes self-dedicated to this goal and becomes a component of the people.
We must have heard about an event called Annaprasam in all parts of India.
This is the first time to give bread to children.
No liquid, no nutritious food.
Somewhere people donate food.
During the birth anniversary of the family, as a day of memories, people of the family take nutritious food, make good taste and take them to Anganwadi or to school, and pay homage to the children of the family.
Sharing their happiness and sharing others.
It's a good coordination of service and happiness.
Friends, There are many small things like this that can fight successfully against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of information about nutrition, lack of nutrition and poor and wealth are suffering.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutritious month throughout the country.
You must also be part of it, add a new programme and your participation will be in it.
If you can save someone from malnutrition then this means that we protect ourselves from malnutrition.
Everything I've gone in the last week, where people have seen 'Man vs'.
However, I have never thought that there will be an opportunity to touch the minds of the youth all over the world.
What's going on
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since I have got the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister, since then, since I have had the opportunity to sit closer to the international Yoga Day, somebody has been asking me something about Yoga within five and a half years.
There's no big leader who didn't discuss me about yoga in the world, this is my experience all over the world.
The Discussion Channels are planning to communicate in 165 countries in the language.
I am sure this episode of the Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world about environment, global temperature and climate change, India's message, India's tradition and natural sympathy in India's cultural journey.
Today people are aware of the steps taken in our India for climate conservation and cleaner environment.
Did you shoot again and again
I'm asking you very carefully.
Look, there's no secret.
I'm gonna open my secret because there's a question in many minds.
Or no secret.
It is true that technology has been used efficiently in the interaction with Bear Grills.
Whatever I say, it's always used to be in English and he used to hear through a small instrument that was in the ears of Bear Grills.
I mean, I was in Hindi but he was listening in English, so the conversation was easier, this is a wonderful exhibition of technology.
After this show, he spoke to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must go to places related to nature and wildlife.
I have said this before and again, we have to go to the north-east of India.
You have to spend some time there.
Ladies and gentlemen, the idea of conserving nature is naturally seen in India.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release the Tiger Census of the country.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, it was only half of it.
In the case of tigers, a Tiger Summit was organised at St. Petersburg in Russia in 2010.
He expressed concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
It was determined to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, and we are going to be targeting faster.
We have doubled the number of tigers by 2019.
The number of tigers in India has doubled not only the number of protected areas and community reserves.
In the Gir forest, one after another took several measures.
In 2007, it was decided to make women guards there.
Infrastructure has been enhanced to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we say about protection.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
Our scientific sciences have a very good advice on this.
Listen to our scientific sciences centuries ago, the wildlife, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation, the wildlife conservation of the wildlife, the wildlife of the wildlife, the wildlife, the wildlife of the wildlife, the
My dear people, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
This Indian Youth Sanyasi, who has captured humanity all over the world, has established India's glittering personality in the world.
Whenever the world looked at any slavery, on 11th September, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change the vision of India.
Come, let us try to live with the true strength of India that Swami Vivekananda had seen in the form of India that Swami Vivekananda had seen.
But I'm not passing through its descriptions.
Wait till 29th August.
To get rid of plastic, we're all trying to get out of the house and outside with all the power.
I am confident that this movement will be filled in social society.
Come, let's move with a new zeal, a new vision and a new energy.
Let us move on with a sense of service and joy within.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 21st January, 2017 at 11 o'clock in the morning.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all.
On January 26, our Republic Day, everyone celebrated with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the commitment of citizens, the rights of citizens and our commitment to democracy, is a kind of cultural festival that makes the future generation aware of democratic and democratic responsibilities.
However, there is no dearth of discussions about the work of citizens and the rights of citizens in our country.
Within two minutes, it shows social vision and determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural pride with the army and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honored with various brave awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Parama Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something, especially in the social media, very enthusiastically
On the one hand, when we are happy to hear the joyous and joyful celebrations on 26th January, our soldiers from the defence forces in Kashmir had come to the forefront of the country's security.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers, bow down to them.
My young friends, you are well aware that I express my mind through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The month of January, February, March and April is the time of exams in all families.
When I came to know about this matter, many teachers, parents, students asked me, asked questions, suggested, said pain, suggested pain.
I want to share with you my mind after seeing all that.
I got the telephone message of a child created.
Listen, creation says, Sir, I want to tell you that there is a very horrible atmosphere in our homes and in our society during the examination.
That's why children have a mindset instead of getting encouragement.
They're very few who are happy for the exam.
It is an occasion of stress for most people to examine.
That's what happens in us, that's what's coming out.
It feels strong on the occasion of the festival of the society.
It's the best.
During the examination, there should be an excitement between family and friends and neighborhood.
You'll see the pressure turning into a plaster, the pressure turns happy.
At the moment of excitement, the mind will become weightless.
Look, there's a change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months exams are conducted.
You must understand that the power to call memories is peaceful.
If you're in depression, all the doors are shut down, the outside doesn't come in, the inside doesn't come out.
There is a hurdle in thought process, and it turns into a weight.
I am telling from my experience, if there is mental stress, we forget, if there is peace, we will not be able to imagine, and it will be very beneficial.
You don't know the problem, it's not that you didn't learn to study.
But when there is a mental stress, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are all buried and your mental pressure is undermining all this.
It seems to be a life-threatening problem.
You'll think you're going to write an exam for a year's study.
P.
J.
If he was disappointed because of this failure, if he had failed to live, India would have received such a great scientist or would have met such a great President.
Therefore, the competition has grown and there has been an increase in mental stress among students.
Mark and Mark Sheet have a very limited use.
That's not all in life.
Life is on the basis of how much knowledge you have achieved.
If you believe in these things, Mark Walk will come after you, and you will never need to follow Mark.
Your knowledge in life is beneficial, efficiency is beneficial, self-confidence is beneficial.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
That's why Mark's weight prevents us from walking on the right path.
But if you take care of the road, you'll slowly restrict you to certain things.
This is a very psychological war.
Indeed, the competition is not useful to lead life, and it is supposed to compete with him to move forward in life.
How's the day going to come better than the last day
How's the chance to come better than what happened
Sometimes you've seen it in the games and you'll get to know about it quickly, so let's say the example here.
The specificity of their lives is that they compete themselves in most of the winners.
Didn't you sleep because of the stress of the test, now you're asleep
Second, you're worse than him.
The third, the same.
Just keep in mind how to do better than before.
The Prime Minister also spoke of the role of the beauty guardians.
He said that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
Because mothers are more aware of the future of children at home, are active, they make things easier.
If you learn to accept, more problems will end there.
So I want to tell my parents that you're sometimes doing this to the children.
Have you ever thought you'd give the child a laughter in the course of the exam
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very funny phone call came.
Because I worked like that in my childhood, and I tried to shout at a time of my childhood.
I've made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find out its ways, so I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Whenever you don't believe in your capabilities, you'll find out if I write it right.
Maybe we're right, it's wrong to write the next one.
I'm gonna suppose you're gonna fucking bury yourself in a wrong way.
I mean, there's nothing to do with copies.
It's like lying, so don't do it.
The copies make you bad, so don't copies.
"What is a Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of the examination", I am angry.
Because it is generally a belief that students are careless about learning by taking care of games .
This idea is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If you want a holistic development, there is a life outside books and it is very wide.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
It's called managing.
There are three things in my view of the examination, the right rest, the second, the sleep for the body, the third, the intellectual activity, and the body have a larger part.
Therefore, the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing trees and trees in front of them, or enjoying your mind
Long breaths lead to tension.
There's no need to stand in the room to breathe deeply.
Some people think they'll be late in the night and learn too much - that's not right.
You must sleep for the body.
So you don't lose time to learn.
A patriot who came to see me about it asked me, how many hours are you sleeping
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing the election, your shutting voice is linked to sleep.
If you sleep for yourself, you'll get your volcano code's comfortable.
He didn't think of sleeping and volcano code and my voice. He gave me a big medicine.
It doesn't mean just sleeping.
So don't do that.
If possible, don't...
Or it'll be a weight, and I'm going to join your family's parents in order to don't weigh.
Keep in mind your determinations and trust yourself in your capabilities and examine.
My best wishes.
Festivals to win all the examinations.
And there's no exam.
Please move with this magic.
Dear countrymen, Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all Coast Guard officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
Coast Guard has been ranked as the 4th largest coastal force in the world, with 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country.
By fulfiling this philosophy, Coast Guard jawans remain uncomfortable in the opposite environment to protect the seashores of the country and the coastal environment.
Last year, Coast Guard jawans have taken a big goal of cleaning the seashore of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is indeed a matter of appreciation that they have thought of coastal security as well as the sanitation of the sea.
Nearly a few people know that in our country, not only men, but also women are successfully fulfiling the responsibility on their shoulders.
Our women officers in Coast Guard are not only Pilate and Observers, but also under the control of the Hovercraft.
The maritime security is today the world's most important issue, and that is why the Indian Coast Guard celebrates hundreds of years on the 40th anniversary of Indian Coast Guard.
On 1st February is the Festival of Vasant Panchami.
The spring is considered to be the best tower.
It's known as the king of springs.
The Festival of Vasanta Panchami Saraswati Puja is in our country.
It is considered an opportunity to worship education.
Not only this, heroes also get inspiration.
Merra Rang de Basanti Chola - This is inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat is also offering new forms in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate the skyman on this thing that they started inspiring, and many greetings to the countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today is an opportunity to serve, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, 'The poor don't have our favour, we don't want our acceptance.'
Saint Luke specifically said, "Jesus has not only served the poor but has also congratulated the poor and this is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them their best.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to reduce the beginning of several development works in the Tapobhoomi of Malviya in Banaras.
I laid the Foundation Stone of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre, which is being built there, will benefit not only in Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also from Jharkhand Bihar.
Today, our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is the birth anniversary of Honourable Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we have achieved the nation in terms of immense strength.
Atal ji established a great ideal as a party leader, as a member of the Lok Sabha, as the Prime Minister.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Many memories reflect.
I have shared an old video this morning when I was addressing the gathering and seeing how I got the opportunity to celebrate Atal ji's year of love as a small worker.
Today, in the day of Christmas, the countrymen are going to get the benefits of two schemes as Christmas gifts.
In a way, the second of November was launched.
There is an atmosphere of ambition all over the country, whether it is a village or a educational person or an illiterate person, how to carry out cashless money and how to buy goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and know each other.
In order to encourage this, the Government of India is launching projects to promote beneficiaries and small businessmen to become e-payment habits to empower mobile banking.
This is not only for a day but also for 100 days from today.
Every day sixteen thousand people get a thousand rupees.
For centuries, millions of households are going to get a gift of crores of rupees and you are eligible for a gift by neglecting the use of digital payments like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI and NSD.
The Digi-Dhan Business Yojana is mainly aimed at traders.
The project is aimed at ensuring that all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower sections of the middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than 50 rupees and less than 3000 rupees will get such gifts.
Those who buy goods for more than Rs. 3000 don't get this gift.
The poor people will be able to buy goods through Feature Phones, ordinary phones, selling goods, shutting down money, and they will be the beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the presentation scheme.
If you ask them, I know they'll tell them all, you'll have children studying in your family and 10 and 12, and they'll tell them all well.
It's as simple as you send the Watts App messages through your mobile phone.
Dear people, information about how to use technology, how to make e-payments and online payments is spreading rapidly in the country.
In the last few days, cashless trade has increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage this.
The bigger the decision is to imagine the business community.
The Digital Distribution Trade Industries (DDIP) provides an incremental tax on income tax while promoting online payment system instead of notice in their business.
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone said that if GST and Licensing fees are closed digitally, the Assam Government has decided to repay 10 percent.
If the branches of rural banks conduct at least two digital transactions between January and March with 75 per cent of their transactions, they will receive a gift of Rs.
As on 31st March, 2017, 100 of the Digital Transmission Villages (DTTs) have been announced as a gift of Rs. 5 lakh under the scheme for Digital Transmission.
They also announced the Digital Farming Shiromani Scheme for the farmers, which will surely give Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers who have made digital payments to buy seeds and curves.
In this context, I congratulate the Assamese government and congratulate all the governments on such initiatives.
Several organizations have adopted successful methods to encourage digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
The Prime Minister said that GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GNFC-Gujarat), which has been mainly focused on the furnace, has set up thousands of POS machines at fertilizer marketing centres for farmers and has been given 5 lakh chocolates to three and a half thousand farmers in a few days through Digital Payments.
The most interesting thing is that GNFCs turnover has increased by 27 over the previous year.
A country like India must be the foremost in this area.
Our youth has made a lot of progress in the startups.
This digital movement is a golden occasion.
Our youth must focus on this sector with new ideas and new technologies and new projects.
So, we can participate in the campaign to evade corruption and black money in the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask people first in Mankibat every month to share your suggestions and tell you that.
According to thousands of suggestions received in MyGov and Narendra Modi App this time, 80-90 of the fight against corruption and black money was about to be backed, and when I saw everything, I felt that the habits would be of three different types.
Some detailed mention that there are many other problems and complications of the people.
Another companion wrote that the good thing for the good of the country is to find out what new ways of belief and how lies are going on in such a holy way.
I am grateful to the people for helping me write so many letters.
The feelings of Guru Mani Kewal are evident in every corner of the country.
We're all aware of this.
When people are suffering, when they are suffering, who are those people who don't have any pain in it
I'm painful as you are.
I clearly know that if 125 crore people stand together then nothing is impossible, people are the image of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I thank the people for participating in this great mission against corruption and black money.
The law is the same to all.
Whether individuals or organisations or political parties, all must adhere to the law.
Those who are unable to openly support corruption and black money are trying to find out the shortcomings of the government.
This government is for the common people.
He's constantly trying to know the opinions of the people.
What is the problem of people, what is the problem of law and what is the solution.
As a government of ever-sensitivity, how many laws have to be changed by looking at the comfort of the people, the goal is to reduce the sufferings of the people.
On the other hand, I said it was an extraordinary fight, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, how many powers have been incorporated in black money transactions full of belief and corruption
What's their strength
When they are determined to fight with such people, they are also taking new methods daily to defeat the government.
When they follow new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You mean, I'm gonna ten... because the corrupt, the liars, the liars, have decided to be free from black money.
On the other hand, all kinds of thieves are being carried out and how they find new ways and other information letters are found from many.
In this context, I congratulate my dear countrymen.
The number of information that is available in the government system is more than double the information from the general public.
It's mostly because the common people are awake.
Can anybody imagine how dangerous the aware people of my country challenge to bring these flaws to light
The third man who wrote the letter is too much, they say, Modi ji, don't be weak, don't stand, don't stand any longer... and we need to go ahead.
I specially thank those who wrote this letter because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out, made a strong 'Benami Economy Act'.
The law will start working in the coming days.
Whatever you do for the country, for the cause of birth, it's preferred.
My dear people, last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that the last year's record has been amended in the field of farming for our farmers during these difficulties.
It is a good wish for the agriculture sector.
Last day, India has been proudly dedicated to the World Economic Web Site in many fields, as a result of the continuous teaching of our people, India's rise in global rankings through different indicators.
Indias rank in World Bank's Doing Business Report is rising.
As per the Global Investment Report released in Dutch, India ranked third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.
We have moved 16 ranks in Global Innovation Index 2016, and the World Banks Logistics Performance Index 2016 has increased 19 ranks.
India is moving at a rapid pace, even though many other reports are assessed.
But I am glad to see that some good things are happening sometimes.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I tried myself to speed up this movement.
My goal was to get the right to the people with disabilities and to get respect.
Our divine brothers and sisters have empowered our efforts and beliefs when they won four medals in Paralimpics.
They not only raised the pride of the country, but also surprised the people with their capabilities.
Our divine brothers and sisters are our invaluable wealth and strength like all the citizens of the country.
I am very happy to note that after passing this law for the welfare of the people with disabilities, there will be more employment opportunities for the Divyangjans.
The Government has increased the limit of reservation in work to 4.
The Act envisages specific departments on education, other facilities and complaints of persons with disabilities.
It can be imagined that in the last two years, the government has organised 4,352 crore rupees and distributed to five lakh eighty thousand sisters and sisters with disabilities.
The government has passed the new legislation in accordance with the desire of the United Nations.
Earlier Divyangar was of seven types.
My young friends, this group includes Talsemia, Parkinson and Turtles.
Over the past few weeks, news from sports was proud of us.
It is natural for us all to be proud as an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team has won 4 reputation against England.
Some of these young players were commendable.
Test captain Virad Kohli gave good leadership along with a good batting.
The Indian Cricket Team's Offspinner Bowler R.
Junior Hockey team made the World Cup.
After 15 years, Junior Hockey is getting the World Cup.
Congratulations to young players for this achievement.
This achievement is a good wish for the Indian Hockey team.
Our ladies were also surprised last month.
India's Women Hockey Team Asian Champions Trophy received a few days ago, India's Women's Hockey Team Venkala Medal at the Under 18 Asian Cup.
Cricket and Hockey team players heartily.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we celebrated Deepawali.
Some wrote poems, some brought pictures, some came to cartoons, some made video.
That's how many houses were turned into military posts.
I am surprised to see how emotional and visionary I still see these letters.
With all your partnership, the book is prepared by giving you the ideas about the army of the country and your vision of the security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Prime Minister, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali are being celebrated on the border.
Every minute, the country's security is in the mind.
However, on the occasions of the celebrations, the house will be remembered.
But it didn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, not at home.
We also had the feeling of celebrating Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
When the nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases to 125 crore.
A few days ago, all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see.
They were people of Jammu and Kashmir's fiveth conference.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in the Kashmir Valley.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a while.
However, when the conversation progressed, the situation in the valley, the law system and the future of children were quite natural.
I am glad that all those villages that came from the Kashmir Valley have been fulfilling my words and words.
They went to the village and awakened people far away.
A few days ago, when the board exam was conducted, about 95 percent of the children from Kashmir participated in the exam.
Our children from Jammu and Kashmir are determined to take new heights of development through education and for a bright future.
Addressing the gathering at 8:00 pm on November 8, the Prime Minister said that a major move to bring about changes in the country was initiated.
The important thing that should be implemented with greater importance and I felt that there will be many problems in our normal life.
I had said that it would take 50 days to get out of the impact of this decision and it would be such a big decision that after 50 days it could be returned to the ordinary ground.
With the help of 500 and 1000, such a large country, such a large number of companies and millions of people are watching this decision carefully all over the world and all the economic experts are analyzing it.
250 crore people in India are looking forward to getting success in combating difficulties.
There may be a question mark before the world.
It is an honour to 125 crore people of India.
There is a firm belief that this decision will win and our country will change like gold.
You are the citizens of this place, you are somehow, and you are also the reason for this path of victory.
The Union Government and the State Governments, all the components of the local organisations, one lakh and thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working with dedicated dedication.
In the midst of a variety of mental conflicts, all of them have become very calm, and have been considered as a nation-serviceman, as an effort to make a great change.
Starting in the morning and working without knowing when the night is completed.
All the officers of the bank and post office are working in the midst of this problem.
If humanity comes, they seem to be in front of two sides.
An adult accident took place in Khandwa
Immediately money was required
It was very happy to know that when he was in the care of an officer of the bank, he himself went to the old man's house and paid the money for the treatment.
This kind of innumerable stories are known by television, media and newspapers and talking to many.
They are trying to save the lives of the poor, enthusiastically enthusiastically enter their accounts, or by doing something else.
But don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Madhya Pradesh, from Terali village of Taluk in Harda district.
This will encourage the people and the non-country economy is very important for nation building.
I'm with the country in this regard.
It's very happy to follow your five and a thousand.
I would like to thank you with my heart, because when you said you'd come to your day, nobody thought that such a big step would take place.
He followed the five and a thousand and taught good lessons to the black money and the corrupt.
All Indians don't have a good day.
People from all over the world have also learnt to talk about tea paws.
But I didn't know how to get married in the tea-pay church.
I knew that on 17th November, there was a marriage with the Chai Pe Church in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who came to her marriage.
He didn't travel, didn't have food programmes, because the money was a little troubled.
People are finding better ways in a difficult situation.
People are looking for their own ways.
You see this change.
The big people with relationships, who don't want to ask them, they don't pay properly, and their wages are very much left.
If all the municipalities come to 50 per cent.
But this time, on the eighth day, everybody has been shutting down all their old books.
3,500 crore in 47 cities during the last year.
You'll be surprised to hear that this week, it's 125 thousand crore.
There will be many such examples that have a direct impact.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages, our farmers have been empowered by the economy of this country.
On one hand, due to this new change in the economy, all citizens are fighting with it in the midst of difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is considerable progress in their credit.
Under the Mudra Yojana, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to such small people, because crores of people are doing these small businesses and the business of crores of rupees is getting faster.
But it was natural for them to be troubled by this decision.
But now our small businessmen are using technology, through mobile apps, through mobile banking and credit cards, and trade is going on on on the basis of faith.
I want to tell these small businessmen that you also have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download the bank's app on mobile phone.
Keep POS machines to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be done in the entire business of your village.
Don't let anybody blame you.
I know you, the youngsters of my country liked my decision.
I know you support this decision.
I know that you are very shared to take this thing forward in a profitable manner.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, are my good friends.
This is a surprising opportunity to serve Maternity. This is an opportunity to take the country to the economic prosperity.
My youth, can you help me
Your family doesn't know about Jews, parents, parents, mothers and mothers.
You know what App is, online banking, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's normal for you, you use it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing that is a non-violent society.
It's true that there's no hundreds of people without notice.
But can't we turn into a slightly careful society
Once you start creating a few-time society, it can't be far away from creation of a non-visionary society.
You know what is the opportunity for the unsighted community, digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facilities.
All the banks in India have mobile apps.
All banks have their own wallets.
Valette means e-parse.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, there are RuPay cards with millions of poor families in India.
The use of Rupee Card, which was used very shortly, has increased by 300 times after the 8th date.
Prepaid cards are available on mobile phones to spend money from the bank like prepaid cards.
Not only this, a big smart phone has become simple and unnecessary.
I have focused on simplifying these arrangements.
All the banks are trying to do it.
My young friends, there's a big generation that doesn't know all this.
I'm very well aware you're all working on this great thing.
I see the creative messages you have given on the Watts App - maps, poems, short stories, cartoons, new imaginations and toys.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this matter.
Your mobile phone will also have the technology to spend online.
Not only this, teach how to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in your accounts and how to give it to the customer.
Once you teach people how to use RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
If you teach the common people all this, they might get rid of all the troubles.
I don't think that if all the youth of India get involved in this matter then it will take more time.
Within a month, we can present a New India before the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, go to ten houses every day, connect ten houses every day.
I invite you to come, not only to support, but also to be a soldier of this change, and to relax.
We will take this war to eradicate corruption and corruption in the country.
The country did a revolution.
My dear youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCC and NSS to do this together.
Let's take this forward.
We have the opportunity to do a good service for the country.
You shouldn't lose this opportunity.
You must have seen that the most renowned artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Yojana is moving forward very heartfeltly.
Cleanliness seems to be spread over his molecule, that's why he remembered his father's birth anniversary as well.
One of the poems of Harivamsharai ji, he wrote, "Man body, joyful mind, joyful life, that's me.
The Swachhta Yojana flows like blood in the veins of Shri Amitabh Ji, his son (Muthika Man, Mastika Man, Sh.
He has written to me through the poem of Harivansh Raiji - Swachh Bharat, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat.
Harivansh Rai ji is honoured.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is celebrated with joy and joy in every corner of India.
India is a country that celebrates any festival in any corner of the country on 365 days.
We have seen the courage to finish unlimited festivals.
The changes in festivals have been naturally accepted as per the requirements of time and society.
Do it through the festivals.
Our ancestors were very scientificly linked to festivals.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
The festivals of trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds were responsible for all.
That is, even in our country, there was a tradition that was celebrated by mixing with Brahman and Science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I have said, this festival also gives us knowledge and reaches with knowledge.
This Deepawali is a message from Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya to light from darkness.
All parts of the house clean up.
We need to enhance this nature and tradition.
Deepawali is no longer in the border of India.
If there is no way in all the countries of the world, then in another way, Diwali is celebrated and celebrated.
Several governments of the world and the parliamentarians and the rulers there are participating in the Deepawali celebrations.
Whether it is eastern countries or western countries or developing countries, Africa or Ireland, the celebrations of Deepawali will be celebrated all over the world.
The Prime Minister of Canada, Shri Narendra Modi, has shown the illumination of Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Shri Narendra Modi, organized a gathering and participated in the Deepawali celebrations in London, connecting all communities.
What is that picture...
The Prime Minister of Australia has conveyed his best wishes to the Indian community and urged people from different cities of Australia to participate in the Deepawali celebrations.
Last day, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said that he has to return to attend the Deepawali celebrations.
This festival of Deepawali shows that this festival of light is becoming a festival of inspiration to bring the world community from darkness to light.
Parents, ask the parents to stay close to the elderly when they bury their kids, they don't care about the obstacles, and don't worry.
The festival of Deepawali is a little longer in our country.
Chhath Puja is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
Even if I talk about Deepawali, even if you talk about Chhath Puja, this is really an opportunity for all of you to fulfil the magnificence.
However, this is also an opportunity to thank the people of the country.
Our soldiers have served their lives for our peace and peace due to the incidents that have occurred over the past few months.
When we celebrate Deepawali, how are our soldiers suffering, some in the desert, some in the summit of the Himalayas, some inspire industrialists, some inspire airports.
How many responsibilities are there
Words, birds, birds, colors, innumerable imaginations...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
The truth is, because you are smiling and smiling, I tell you that you are sleeping peacefully because you are the mountains and the gardens of India that bow down to you.
My dear countrymen, a sister, Shivani, full of soldiers, gave me a message on telephone.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
- Namaskar, Prime Minister, I'm speaking Shivani.
The launch of this Deepawali programme of Message to Jawan gives a lot of boost to our soldiers.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in Army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
There are good messages that the border officers get a lot of encouragement, and everybody in the Army Circle gets encouragement.
Army officers and solicitors and their families and their wives have a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, there is a good message to the soldiers and I wish you the Deepawali.
My dear countrymen, we see soldiers standing not only in the border but in all the areas of life.
Our soldiers are working nationally in all spheres of life, if there are natural calamities, if they have to face the law and order, if they have to dare to bring back the wrongdoing youth.
First, Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be on one November.
The name of his village, Badana.
He came there and was discussing the construction of toilets.
Some households have not seen the construction of toilets due to financial difficulties.
Vikas Thakur worked as a part of the Swachhta Abhiyan by providing a thousand rupees to 57 families from their pockets.
This has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defence Free.
In the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is a dwelling place where there is no way to go, but it is a village that can reach hard all day long.
People don't go there.
Cadet and National Service Scheme's senior functionaries and engineering students decided to make their own toilets together.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
It's just what I said.
In this regard, all the citizens of these states are congratulating and appreciating them for their participation in the destruction of the destruction of darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government are very important and after the first such scheme, the first scheme has to be abandoned.
However, nobody pays attention to these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us.
You decide on this criteria.
We have to face the awakening hopes of the poor in the country, which is the need of the hour.
Now there are toilets for girls and girls in schools, and boys are also toilets.
Twenty-fiveth century is the first century and it doesn't happen to be dark in the village.
Therefore, in order to free the village from darkness, the programme of electric delivery is progressing successfully.
Efforts are being made to provide smoke-free life to 5 crore households.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers and hungry people were in the grip of the ship.
Mudra Yojana, Standup Scheme, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successful programmes for the rescue of the robbers.
Direct funds to Aadhaar Loot Bank and direct funds to the deserving people
This is an opportunity for common man to get rid of intermediaries.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October, the great men of this country made India's unity a lifetime and that is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October is the occasion of Sardar Saheb's birth anniversary, the birth anniversary of a living man of the country's unity
I think he's successful in it, and he's all together.
On that day, we can say that the fate of the country that Indira Gandhi was slaughtered and was fortunate.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lived for unity, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, the cruelty of the Sardars, gives us pain in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of others, and from the acts of others, and prevent the country from it.
Sardar Saheb's lifestyle started in the fight against farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching out to the farmers of the freedom struggle.
Now we're sometimes listening to the name of Ashul.
Even today, people from outside India are aware of all the original products, but it is a result of Sardar Saheb's divine vision of the co-operative Mill Producers' Union, which was known as Kera district at that time.
He emphasized this idea in 1942.
We are obviously in front of us as a source of comfort and prosperity for the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with respect.
On this solidarity day, on 31st October, we must remember Sardar Saheb anywhere and understand the idea of unity.
My dear countrymen, this festival of Deepawali is a glimpse of Kartika Purnima and this is a light festival.
The information and advice given by Guru Nanak Dev is not only Hindustan but also a guide to the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty and good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was accompanied by his co-operation when there were untouchables, specific and sympathetic disorders here.
We can follow the enlightenment that inspires us to leave the differences, in order to do something against the differences, if we have to go with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, who will have a better way than Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev also bows to the occasion of this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, on the occasion of Deepawali, many congratulations to all of you.
Your dreams and imaginations are successful in all senses.
Your life is comfortable and peaceful.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 21st September, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In the last few days, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack on Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector.
I salute all these heroes and pay homage to them.
The son lost this loss, the brother lost, not only those families who lost the husband.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We are proud of our army.
There is a lot of opportunity to interact with traditional and political leaders.
All parents want all the schools and colleges to start functioning openly.
They want their crops and fruits to reach markets in India.
I mean, the economic business also wants to walk right.
Over the past few days, business has started walking well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace, our progress and the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to pay new heights of tourism.
I am confident that we will find peace together for all the problems and will prove to be the right path for the future generation of Kashmir.
The security of the families of Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The Governance has to take some measures to keep the law.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of our eastern powers and laws is for peace and comfort for the common people of Kashmir, and they should be properly followed by our security forces.
Sometimes those who think differently from what we think, reflect on new ideas.
I get the opportunity to know a lot from the social media in the past.
There is an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of people from every corner of India, which encourages the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshavardhan of Class Eleven gave me a different idea.
He wrote, I was so upset after the terror attack in Uri, and I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative perspective.
But when the war took place in 1965, Lal Bahadur was a scientist who led us, and there was an excitement all over the country, fury and the rivalry of patriotism.
Everybody wanted to do something, thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Scientific joyously tried to touch this cultural level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan and inspired the people of the country to work for the country.
Lail Bahudur scientists showed that there would be other ways to show patriotism between bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi was guided to freedom, when he was strong, he used to take a staircase for the struggle, it was very effective to return that strength to creative things in the society.
Let the army and the army fulfil their responsibilities, let the rulers fulfil their duties, if we communicate with the spirit of this patriotic fervour, then the country will surely attain new heights.
Dear countrymen, Mr. T.
He wrote to me at the Carthik Narendra Modi App, the survivors who went to participate in Paralympics, and their performance was the success of human consciousness, the Human Spirit.
Not only both of you, but also our players who participated in Paralimpics in the country have received an emotional relationship.
Perhaps the achievement of Para Olympics and our sportspersons has changed the vision of humanity and the vision of the Divine Divine.
I don't forget the words of our successor sister Deepa Malik.
When I got the medal, the sister said, I failed with this medal.
These words have great power.
This time, in Para Olympics, 19 of our country's 3-women, including 3-women.
In comparison to other sports, more than the physical capabilities of the Divyangs and the skills of the sports are determined.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have achieved 4 medals so far - two gold, one silver and one bronze and two gold medals in Paul Wolt after 12 years.
He was losing his hand due to electric injury.
You think a man won gold medals at the age of thirty-third and then at the age of thirty-third, he'd be able to get the second gold medal.
Marian Tangwelu won gold medals at Haizamp.
Thanks to Thanks to the right in just five years.
Poverty doesn't hinder his vision.
He's not a man living in a big city, but a middle class family.
Whether it leads a painful life or a physical complications, he has won medals for the country through uncertainty.
If it's Light Deepawali, it's rocked a variety of winners and won it.
Varun C.
Bronze medal at Bhadi Haizam.
It is also important that in our country, in our society and in our neighbourhood, we are motivated to look at the divine brothers and sisters.
We must awaken our sympathy and change our vision of this divine person, very few people know how much performance this time in Paralimpics has been shown.
A few days ago, the Olympics competitions were held at the same place.
It's somebody's supposed to think that even the recade of the general Olympics has been corrected.
This time it happened.
In the coming days, India is trying to make a smooth system for Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week, I had a very amazing experience in New York in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people who were there, people were surprised.
That day I got the opportunity to publish a book and some of them were the success stories of the lives of some divine people.
It was very encouraging.
I believe that it is very important to establish India on the soil of New York.
In eight hours, about six hundred divine people were able to carry machines that cannot be heard.
It's got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has stepped up 1. 55 crore towards cleanliness.
It was sure how good the results are moving in the right direction and what is happening through a slight effort.
That's why all the common people, whether they are administrative or office, roads, bus stands, railways, schools, colleges, religious institutions, hospitals, children to old people, poor villages and women all play their role in cleanliness.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to protect the health of the family, especially the mothers and sisters, the winter of the open defecation should be over.
Therefore, the open defence free (ODF) has started the birth of an open defecation in the open space.
A healthy competition is going on in the villages of the States and the States and districts.
The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will succeed in getting rid of open defecation.
Come on, let's move.
In particular, I am going to present a programme in front of the youngsters, especially in recent times, using technology in a big way.
What is peace in your city about cleanliness and everyone has the right to know it, the Indian government has given a number for it - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
By calling this number of 1969, you will not only be able to understand the conditions of construction of toilets but also apply for making toilets.
You'll get the benefit from it.
Not only this, a Swachhata App has been launched to know about cleanliness related complaints and solutions to those complaints.
You use this, especially the new generation.
Indians have urged the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is related to cleanliness, as well as cleanliness is essential for a model.
The waste must be part of the wealth.
So we must look for the West to Combost with the Swachhta Mission.
Fertilizer companies have asked them to buy composts from waste.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to conduct intensive discussions about cleanliness and cleanliness.
What can you do with technology
How can we get job opportunities
All these issues will take place.
I see that new news about cleanliness is coming.
On this day, I was present in the newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and made a awareness campaign to build toilets.
The objective is to make 1000 toilets and to spread the message of Swachhta from Devprayag to Gangasagar in a team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh.
Each department of India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I would like to urge the people to join these departments in their interactions without being linked to them.
There's a cleaning surveillance.
First of all, 73 cities were served and Swachh Bharat was presented to the people.
Now there are 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh.
With this, this time we are behind, the next time we will be able to do something better in every city.
This is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Scientists on 2nd October.
It's been two years since Swachh Bharat Mission.
This will prove to be the light of Deepawali at the house of the poor and this time on October 2, Sunday.
That day, you cannot participate in the evacuation of filthy filth.
On the memorial of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we can determine to do something for the country.
The Joy of Giving Week is going to be celebrated in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
It's a way to deliver food and clothes to the needy.
This is the centenary year of Din Dayal Upadhyay.
Her contribution to the common man, the common man, and the Antyodaya philosophy.
Mahatma Gandhi was talking about the welfare of the last person who stood at the end.
How can the poor get the benefits of development
I would like to concentrate on the achievements of the development of the society, the attention of the people and the people of the society.
It is a symbol of the poor welfare year, all of us were inspirational men, and I salute the Honourable Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, who was rich with our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, I started Mann Ki Baat on the occasion of Vijaya Dashmi.
I have tried myself not to be a programme to mark Mann Ki Baat.
The Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme of political abuses and transplantation.
How is the common man in this country inspire me
That is, Mann Ki Baat is not a dialogue 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social transformation has increased.
Anybody's more happy than that.
English rendering of the text of PMs address to the people of India on 21st August, 2016 at 11.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Hockey Mantrik Dhyanchand on 29th August.
He played a vital role in winning Gold in Hockey in the Olympic Games in 1928 and 1932 and 1936.
We all like cricket, have heard Bradman's name.
He told me about Dhyanchand that Hi Scorse Gols Like Runs.
Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once during a game in Kolkata, a opponent was hit by Hockeystick on the head of Dhyanchand.
Then there were 10 minutes to finish the game.
Dhyanchand said that three goals were put in ten minutes and answered by the goals.
My dear countrymen, during the Mann Ki Baat time, there are many suggestions on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
They're full of diversity.
But this time everyone wants to say something about Rio Olympics.
I look forward to asking the Prime Minister of the country to say something about this, so closely and so awake to the Olympics.
There is so much awareness and love among the citizens of India about the games without cricket.
Our daughters have once again proved that they are not behind anyone.
It seems that women from all over India are taking a mission to reach India.
The summit in MyGov wrote that we could have done better than the Olympics.
He wrote, Honble Modisar, for the first time we have won two medals in Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
The society still considers sports as a loss of time.
It's important to change this thinking.
The spirit of society has to be enhanced.
Nobody can do this better.
We can't deny that we can't do an act like we hoped.
In some ways, our sportspersons have shown good performance in India, but they have not been able to expect the best performing here.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if we don't get the medal, we'll see a good show in many ways.
You see, Bindraji won the fourth place in the shooting, and he lost the medal in a very small difference.
That's what happened to Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana in Tennis.
We have performed well in thatletics.
The first simplified Babar Track and Field Revolution in 32 years after Usha was eligible.
It is a matter of great pleasure to know that after 36 years, the Women's Hockey team reached Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, look at the male hockey.
Our team is very strong.
Many sportspersons, such as Aditya Ashoka, Dattoo Bhoknal and Das were good.
But, dear countrymen, we have to do a lot of things.
But if you do it again, maybe we'll be disappointed again.
We'll make a framework on how we can be better.
2020, 2024 and 2028 have to be prepared with a far-reaching vision.
The state governments have to make such committees and think about what we can do in the field of sports and what we can do in every state.
States should choose one or two of their own varieties of power.
I urge sports associations that they have to be carefully consulted.
I urge every citizen of India to give me the message of whatsoever interests you want.
We'll be fully prepared.
Dear countrymen, September 5 is a teacher day.
I spent a lot of time with students on the Teacher's Day for several years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from small kids.
For me, September 5 was a teacher day and a chapter day.
But this time I have to attend the G20 Summit, so I have decided to show my feelings in Mann Kiba.
There's a teacher in his life as much as the mother has.
I have seen teachers who are worried about their own things more than their own.
They pay life for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after Rio Olympics, I hear about Punela Gopichand all around.
On the Teacher's Day, I salute Phule Gopichand, his penance and his dedication to sports and his way of joy in the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in our lives.
The President of India, Dr.
It is the birth anniversary of Sarvey Radhakrishnan ji and the country is celebrating this day as a teacher day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today, he seems to teach me in the classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me the Currency Course.
It'll be amazed to see his handwriting at the age of nineteen.
I feel very proud to see someone's good letters because my letter is very bad.
My dear countrymen, the Ganesh festival is coming closer.
Ganesh changes the contradictions... let not our country, our society, our family, everybody's lives differ.
The launch of the Jana Ganesh Festival is a world-wide folk so that he made this religious festival an opportunity to awaken the country.
Today, Ganesh Festival is going on not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
All youngsters are making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very excited.
Some people are still unable to comply with the sentiment that the world has emerged.
Discussions on public issues, archives, flowers festivals.
The issues touching the society in its views are very artistically presented.
In a way, a big initiative of public education is being carried out through Ganesh Festival.
Inspired by the inspiration of the universal Tilkan Swaraj as our birthright.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival is a new life for the lives of the individual and the society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but it has to be designed according to the time.
This time, some people have written to me particularly about the Ganesh festival and the Durga Puja.
Don't use Ganesh ji made of soil in the village pond.
The idols made of the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He's suffering a lot from others.
I would like to ask you to make statues of Ganesh and Durgadevi and return to our old tradition.
Ganesh is a disgusting man.
That's why we shouldn't make Ganesh a break-up.
I don't know how much you're going to take, but I'm not only saying this, they say.
Several such institutions are trying to make a soil smelling smell.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
There is no harm to the environment because it merges in the lake with a rock on the river.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna will proclaim Mother Teresa on 4th September.
Madar Teresa used to serve the poor of India throughout his life.
It is natural for all Indians to feel proud that the Madar Terresa, who served the poor for the entire life, is getting a sacred status.
On 4th September, the Government of India is also taking up an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore Indians.
We get to learn something from saints, sages, sages and great men.
We're getting something, learning, doing something good.
My dear countrymen, how much change happens when development is a people-to-people.
The power of man is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made successful efforts to clean the Ganga and connect people with the help of 5 State Governments.
A meeting of village chiefs on the bank of Ganga was called in Allahabad this month.
I extend my warm greetings to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this idea.
I thank the five States and the Chief Ministers for the great footprint for purification of the Ganga with the power of the people.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and those who have formed these ideas have a special respect in my mind.
On July 15, more than one-and-a-half lakh students of more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh together wrote a letter to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarhi.
They told their parents that they wanted toilets in their homes.
They asked, some people wrote that this year they didn't celebrate their birth anniversary, but they must have made a toilet.
That's what inspires us.
I don't have a sixteen-year-old girl in Kopal district of Karnataka and this child has committed a swearing-in against her family.
The family was not financially capable.
The child stands in peace.
Mohammad Shafi, the village chief, who was supposed to satisfy the Malma Defecation and made a toilet within a week.
The strength of the girl Malma and the village chief like Mohammad Shafi are also greetings.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have targeted this.
The website will provide information on this.
The Short Films will be awarded to the winners on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I would like to tell the TV channels that you have to come out to make films like this and make a competition.
Effectiveness will also strengthen the efficiency of waste, new liquids will be available, new methods will be known, new inspiration...
It will be through the sharing of people and common artists, whether there is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Many may feel that the President should inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
Our neighborhood is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural tradition.
Akashwani Mythri and Bangladesh Betar, where they will share their programmes and the people of Bengali languages from both sides will enjoy the activities of Akashwani.
Akashwani's contribution is very big in creating a personal relationship.
The President inaugurated this.
I thank Bangladesh for collaborating with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to the sky for their participation in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, you have given me as the Prime Minister, but I am a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart.
Such embarrassing events give new energy, inspire and inspire the people of India to do something.
Millions of mothers of India, who have been working hard to help and help others.
My dear countrymen, last year, we were suffering due to fatigue, but this month of August was filled with difficulties due to continuous rains.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central governments, the local independence institutions, the social institutions and citizens have made a lot of efforts to do whatever they do.
But there were some other news about the flood, which had to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity and how big changes can be made by moving together will be remembered in August this year.
The GST Act was passed by nearly 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament together in order to resist each other and to resist the strong political variation of August 2016.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be achieved if all parties walk together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties in the country together talked about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of 125 crore people.
This morning I got the opportunity to spend with some young people from Delhi.
I believe that in the coming days, all the youth of the country will be blooming in the colors of the zeal of the Olympics Games.
The whole world will drown in sports.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our players anywhere.
I will surely send messages to sportspersons on the website of Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all together try to increase the dignity and self-respect of all our people and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, I would like to hear a poem from a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash, who is interested in poetry while talking to you about Rio Olympics.
There are many other poems like this, they must have written such poems, some may have written somebody else and some may have discovered the music of poems.
I want to share with you the poems that Suraj has sent me.
Mr. Angit Karke, a young man, remembered me on the occasion of the anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Shri Abdel Kalam's dreams have been inspired to write and ask what steps your government has taken to realize.
The next century will be guided by technology.
If someone tries to capture it then it will be evident in new inventions at a distance, if we want to join technology then we must move ahead.
Therefore, we can take research and innovation as the vital elements of technology.
Innovation, management, entrepreneurship etc.
If we organise the second generation of innovation, our children will join it.
That's why the Indian government started the Atal Tinkering Abs.
The programme will provide assistance of Rs. 10 lakh to schools and Rs. 10 lakh for the next five years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
If we are able to build self-sufficient incubation centres, we can create a systematic mechanism to reach it in a systematic manner for start-ups for innovation.
Building of new Incubation Centres and innovation of Old.
We have to face many problems in everyday life.
If you get sick, you'd like to recover immediately, so you're eating any antibiotics.
You'll get relief for a while, but you have to stop taking antibiotics without consulting the doctors.
We don't eat antibiotics until the doctor writes.
We don't have to walk through such bits.
And this war will take years to move forward, make new medicines and scientific research.
Until then these diseases will continue to create new problems.
So we must always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
The doctor will tell you to eat 15 pills in 5 days.
It's all the days the doctor suggests to take the pills and complete the course.
If you take more medicines than required, it will be beneficial for the bacteria.
That's why it's a big deal to take the pills for how long the doctor suggests.
It's called antibiotic resistance in medical language.
That is why it is important to follow the rules of use of antibiotics.
Our government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance.
You might have seen a red appearance on the sides of the antibiotics sold today.
I'm asking you to take care of it.
I want to add another thing to health.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
Deficiency of blood during pregnancy and subsequent bleeding, infections related to delivery and high blood pressure should not be said to have killed their lives.
In view of this, the Government of India has been implementing a new scheme, namely, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Yojana for the last few months.
Under this scheme, all pregnant women are getting free check-ups at the Government Health Centres every month.
I primarily call upon genecologists that one day in a month i. e.
I believe you must be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the world is concerned about climate change, global temperature and environment.
Community discussions are going on in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
Lord Krishna is discussing trees in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.
There is no medicinal medicinal medicinal medicinal medicinal medicinal medicinal herbs.
Whoever donates the tree rises to the world and triangles like his rocks.
That's why their parents want to plant good trees and protect them like figs.
Whatever the Gita, the supremacy of the Mahabharata or the discipline of the Mahabharata, there are some who live themselves in these ideals in today's generation.
A few days ago, I took care of a girl from Pune, Sonal.
It touched my mind.
The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the trees are fulfilling the responsibility of the trees in the world, and Sonal is working hard to fulfil the wishes of not only his parents but also the society.
The Kejunar in Pune, Maharashtra, in the village of Narayanpur in Taluk, was inspired by the greatest inspiration of the marriage of his ancestral son.
I saw the picture in social meditation.
I am amazed that only the plants were visible.
This scene that touched the mind was in the picture.
Sonal is a graduate, and this idea is her own.
You will see how much nature has shown its love by offering money to those who have been married.
In another way, Sonal's marriage has become a sustainable story of natural love and I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatmaji for this innovative effort.
This can be transformed into a natural populace of trees.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted about 1. 5 crore trees across the state on 1st July this year and decided to plant 3 crore trees next year.
25 lakh plants in Rajasthan is not unnecessary.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan know how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its greenery by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat also has a bright tradition of forest festival.
This year, Gujarat has organised to plant millions of trees by offering several names such as mango forests, Ekta forests and martyr forests to the festival.
But for me, South African travel was a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela while remembering South Africa.
It is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when he hears the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoeni Settlement, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I got the privilege of traveling from the Peter Maritburg station on a train travelled by Mahatma Gandhi, which was the only thing to make a son-in-law Mahatma Gandhi.
I also want to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great people who have honoured their youth for equality and equal opportunities in the society.
They fought with Nelson Mandela on the shoulder for 20-22 years and lived in prisons.
I am fortunate to see the greatest friends of Nelson Mandela, Shriman Ahmad Kathara, Shriman Lalu Cheeba, Shriman George Besos and Rani Cassarils.
Even after such a great penance, they couldn't see the feelings of getting on their faces.
I have seen the symptoms of Kartiva Philosophy - that is, the symptoms of the work in Geeta.
There is no mantra of equality and equal opportunity for any community and the government.
Their thoughts are natural.
They told me about an incident, a sculpture work from Bangalore.
A lady froda blew up 11 lakhs in a chit table and then I read the news they committed suicide.
As a woman, I'm sorry about her family.
I want to know what you're talking about this kind of chit-frod meal.
I realized that in a few minutes he's all gone.
You may have been misunderstanding.
They'll be so comfortable.
But I had a very pleasant experience here.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Men and girls were very excited.
They came with a big album, and they had a joy on their face.
The artistic painting was done at the station.
Not only this, plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the midst of the chaps in the rural areas are collected and filled with soil and planted in it and they are built Vertical Gardens.
And on one side of the railway station, this Vertical Garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new feeling.
My dear countrymen, the time of festivals has come in our country over the years.
Think, don't give the sister a gift to protect her life, not only this, we'll have women cooking in our house.
There will be a woman who cleanses our house, and she will be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the right meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
Our dear countrymen, many of us are born in the post-independent times.
I am the first Prime Minister to be born after independence.
Let the entire country be inspired by the zeal of freedom fighters and let us once again celebrate the evil of freedom.
Let's all create this atmosphere.
And the Independence Day celebrations should become a programme of the people of the country without a government programme.
We must be our own celebrations like Deepawali.
I want you too to do some good things related to it by inspiring from patriotism in national love.
Its pictures must be sent to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere in the country.
You would like to present that thing in your mind from the Red Fort with so strongness.
As a representative of your mind, as your chief servant, if I want to say these things from the Red Fort, I am inviting you.
I don't want to be the Prime Minister's words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, technology platforms are easier for you to reach me.
I am grateful to the sky for presenting Mann Ki Baat at 8 o'clock in the evening in local languages.
Many of these suggestions help in the functioning of my government.
Perhaps there's a week's time to start the rainy season, so we're very excited.
Nearly in most parts of the country, there is a severe heat of summer.
Climate change increases such problems.
The widening of the forest area was reduced and trees were cut off.
In a way, man destroys nature and destroys himself.
June 5 is the World Environment Day.
Discussions are going on around the world.
In the past, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and the Himalayan valleys have become firefighters and you must have understood this.
I got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha, who have been suffering from heat waves in the last days.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, there was no such substantial discussion on how much the central government had paid, how much it was spent.
In a way, in many areas, water conservation, environment, dry smoothness, livestock conservation and dry infected persons have shown the best work for the entire country.
I asked the NITI Aayog to adopt better models and take steps to implement it in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have been fully utilized.
I want to take successful experiments of the States through NITI Aayog to other areas.
Peoples participation in such issues is a major instrument of success.
If there is a comprehensive planning, it can make significant changes if the systems are fulfilled within the time frame by using appropriate technology.
Irrigation is also important.
Their objective is to include two-three lakh hectares of land in more micro-irrigation every year.
Chattisgarh has been implemented by Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds were included in the Balram Talab Yojana, which is not a small calculation.
They were aimed at water conservation and projects for water conservation of 10 and 20 kms of small tissues have been implemented in some states.
It's a good experience.
I want to say that one drop of rains received from June, July, August and September does not lose water.
Now we have to think about how to have a place for water conservation.
God has given water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
Looking at a lot of water, we're unaware and we're not getting water in the rainy season.
In the last few days, the media has explained the difficulties of water supply.
I believe that the media can provide guidance for water conservation, expand its activities and the media can also be participants in the path of water conservation.
I invite them to it.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
Make a transparent India.
Our plans must be taken to all corners of India without any simplicity.
We have to make small changes in our old moods.
However, today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks like a cashless society.
It is possible to send and capture money from all over the world through electronic technology.
When we gather together, we'll be in the form of a moneyless group.
Perhaps you might have seen that RPA CARD has been given with Jandhan account.
The Credit Debit Card will be used in the coming days.
There's no need for money or oil from the pocket.
It is the Bank on Mobile - Newsal Payment Interface Banking Transaction-PI which will transform sustainable systems.
Your mobile phone will make it very easier for multi-transfer money.
If it's easier, the RPA CARDs don't have to carry it all the time.
Further, post offices are also active in banking services.
Unlawful transactions will last forever.
The effect of black money will be better.
So, my countrymen, I want to start this.
Once we start, we can easily move.
We might have thought about this day about thirty-fifteen years ago, so much mobile will be in our hands.
I don't want money to turn into a society.
It would have been better if it could have happened without a call.
My dear countrymen, whenever the Olympics competition comes or starts playing, we're gonna be far behind the gold medal.
If you get silver.
Everybody has to encourage our sportspersons who are participating in the Rio Olympics to enhance spirit and zeal in their way.
Over the last week, we were all worried about what will be the result of elections, especially what will be the results in Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons, encouraging our sportspersons, gives a big spirit and strength to everybody.
Without sportsman sports, India must swim in front of the world without singing everybody in the rocks of the magnificence.
The results of the students who have been tested in the 10th and 12th classes have been followed by hardworking all year.
I want to tell those who are unable to win. There's a lot to do in life.
A Mr. George in Madhya Pradesh...
George Patel, he had a great trouble before me.
33 per cent was not satisfied in the market.
Everybody told me that I lost 90 percent of the shortfall of March 4.
I don't know what I felt like weighing in my mind.
I read your letter carefully.
I think, maybe this pain is not yours.
Millions of students like you, because such an atmosphere is conserved.
By finding satisfaction in all matters, we can lead the society towards peace and satisfaction.
Your relatives, helpers and friends are 89.
I have written from Jodhpur, Anand Giri Goswami and that is almost the same.
He says people around me don't accept our results.
I don't remember the whole poem but I wrote a poet a long time ago that I had painful pictures in the canvas of life.
Some say it's good if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if this letter was there instead of putting it here.
It might have been better if one or two of them had seen the pictures of my pain.
Everybody was talking about the duties.
Thousands of students like you are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much, you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everybody shows the needs.
But stand in your pocket and try to fill a little more beautiful.
But if we are not satisfied with the achievements, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the basis of great successes.
The satisfaction that has emerged from victory is not a step in success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You might have heard of the volume of Santur.
There was a time when the Santur Vehicles were associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But Pundit Shivakumar, who was handled by him, made it the greatest volume of the world.
Shehnai- Our music was in very limited areas all over the world.
Most of the kings were at its doors in the darbars.
But when Ustad Bismala Khan was handed over to Shehana, it turned into a world-wide drive.
The cost is very low to avoid being sick, but on occurrence of disease there is a lot of money to repeat health.
If someone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
Yoga has a special respect all over the world and it has respect and faith.
Yoga provides strength to lead a balanced life to the world suffering from stress.
Every person has to spend 20-25 minutes or 30 minutes in his lifestyle.
For this, on June 21, Yoga Day, we are inspiring.
Sometimes, a social insight is a cause of changes in the lives of a person.
I hope you'll take precautions wherever you were on June 21.
In your neighboring areas, in your cities, in villages, in your school, in institutions, reiterate it even in office.
Start a month from now, and look at it, you'll be participating on June 21.
I'm going to attend the Chandigarh event this time.
My dear countrymen, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I have been continuously connecting with you.
A long time ago, I gave you a mobile number, in which you could hear Mann Ki Baat by doing mid-col.
But it's simplified.
You need only four-four days to hear Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever you miss this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat anywhere.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all again.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when I and you are waiting.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls, many stories, instructions and inspirations...
People have seen discussions on books written on science, technology, new inventions, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
People urged me to discuss many other books.
But I don't have to say I can't extend time to read a lot of books.
Let us start a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App and we can write and discuss when we read a new book.
You can suggest a name for this book corner.
I would like this book corner to become a living platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have worked hard on water conservation.
People share information on traditional methods.
For instance, the enthusiasm shown in the field of water conservation in the village of Ara Keram, a few minutes from Ranchi, Jharkhand, has become a favorable example for everyone.
The charming State of the North-Eastern India, Meghalaya, has become an independent reservoir.
I congratulate the government there.
There is very little water required in Haryana, but the farmers are focusing on non-loss farming.
I especially congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, turning them out of traditional farming and inspiring them to harvest a little water.
It's time for the festivals.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given in a very good way, exhibitions, street drains, and the message of water conservation along with the festival can be very unsuccessful.
Friends, some things in life are encouraging us.
In particular, the achievements of children and their works give us new energy.
So I want to talk about some kids.
They are from Nidhi Bypass, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Ravat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tewari, Prati Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aryanitesh Ganguly, Haritik Alamda.
Your mind, your pride and enthusiasm will be filled with pride when I tell you about them.
We all know that the word Cancer is one of the most horrible words in the world.
Don't be a champion after winning the medal.
However, it was a rare occasion that they were champions before participating in the competition.
That's also the champions of life.
The World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
That is, those who fought against cancer in their lives participated in the competitions like shooting, swimming, running and football.
All these champions in our country won the medal in the tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one variety.
Ladies and gentlemen, you must have been proud of Indias success in space beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
From Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Sanjay Haripura, Kolkata and Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched A-SAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, the country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 to the atmosphere.
The launch pictures of Chandrayaan 2 filled people with pride and enthusiasm.
Chandrayaan 2 mission is special in many ways.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But we must always remember that we have the ability to survive it.
I hope that Chandrayaan will inspire the youth of 2 countries to turn to the world of science and discovery.
Science is essentially opening the path of development.
We are awaiting the time when Lander Vikram and Rover Pragya are Landed on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baa, I would like to share with the students of the country about a very attractive competition to the youth.
The youngsters of the country want to invite youngsters to a quiz competition and the topics of space-related examinations, India's scientific missions and scientific technologies will be issues.
I call upon young friends and students to participate in this matter and make it attractive, joyous and unbearable through your partnership.
I urge the parents, enthusiastic princes and teachers to make my school successful.
Encourage all the schools to share it.
This will be a history of their lives for the successful students.
But it has to be involved in the problem, most of them have to get the mark, and be successful.
Inspire more friends.
Dear friends, you'll be careful.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhata Abhiyan has increased from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of overbridges and schools to the halls, people and people were with them, it was a big movement.
You must have seen how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a big role in this regard.
We need to develop a culture that creates wealth from waste in our society.
In a way, we have to move to the point of calling gold from the waste.
Ladies and gentlemen, last day, I read a very attractive word in MyGov.
This command belonged to Bhai Mohammad Aslami, a resident of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: It is very happy to hear Mann Ki Baat.
I have actively participated in organizing the Back-to-Village for Community Mobility programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I believe that this kind of programme is going to increase every three months.
It also requires an online monitoring programme.
This programme involves the people of Kashmir to join the mainstream of development, how encouraging they are.
For the first time in this programme, senior officers went straight to the villages and unrecognised officers came to their homes to understand the obstacles in the development of the villages and to solve the problems and the programme took place for a week.
How to increase the income of the people
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion.
Several issues such as literacy, proportion of women, health, waste free, water conservation, electricity, water, education of girls and problems of elderly citizens were discussed.
Friends, this programme was not a programme of the government as the officer returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers had eaten two days and one night in the Panchayat so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added many things to make this program more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, he played a sports game for children.
He also distributed sports kits, job cards of the National Employment Programme, categories and Scheduled Certificates.
This kind of programme and peoples participation in which our sister-in-law, brother-in-law of Kashmir, wants to govern, and it is understood that the strength of progress is more than the strength of bombs and guns.
It is obvious that those who want to spread hatred on the path of development, want to create obstacles, they cannot achieve their immense objectives.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramachandra Bandre, the Jnanpith Awardee, said in his poem the glory of the month of Shravan.
In this, he said, Hodige Madigae Agyedu, the land of the terrain is magnificent, the relationship between rains and waterfalls is different, the earth is blooming in its beauty.
The people of different cultures and languages of India celebrate the month of Shravan in their own ways.
In this season, we look at the environment and feel that the earth is covered with green grass.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, some people fast with humility and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this period, the Rakshabandhan Festival was a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
This time, more than four years of devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra while talking about Shravan.
Since 1st July, more than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days of this journey in 2015, more people participated this time in just 28 days.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu Kashmir and their teaching habits for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people coming back from the journey are transforming the spirit of enthusiasm and selfishness of the people of the state.
They're all very helpful in the future pilgrimage.
On the other hand, it is a huge rainy season in many parts of the country.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is very difficult to decide where to stop Mann Ki Baat.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Many times it seems that India is a country of economic humility through festivals.
Festivals change on the occasion of economic moisture for the poor of the society.
You know I'm using technologies properly, so I get more information.
Ganesh V.
Savesh Warker wrote to me that this season is a tourist season.
Many national and foreign tourists are becoming tourists .
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes there is a feeling of disappointment from many corners of the country.
It is the strength of the country that millions of people do some good in their own ways as well as in the same way.
There are new opportunities for education and employment.
When the world is attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Day of Yoga, we rely on Indias strength and pride.
This feeling reflects our minds in India's vast vision.
Cleanliness sounds at home today.
The participation of the people is increasing in this.
It's also a service.
I also made a small effort on my way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youngsters, on 15th August, at the Red Fort, the first discussion on Startup India and Standup India began.
This was followed by discussions in the departments of the Government.
Can India become a startup capital
We have discussed the need to start new startups and new innovations in the field of manufacturing, in the service sector and initiate agri-cleanliness in order to create a greater opportunities amongst the youth in the States.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youngsters from any corner of India have to give them the opportunity.
Startup India and Standup India should not be rotten in some cities.
It should be expanded to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to expand this.
On January 16, I'll discuss this with you clearly.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youths, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
There are millions of people like me who are inspiring from Swami Vivekananda.
Since 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti has been celebrated as National Youth Festival on 12th January.
This year from 12th to 16th January is celebrated in Raipur in Chhattisgarh.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, you can see the swing of dreams.
You can see the strength of decisions.
Can you share your suggestions on this Youth Festival
I think this is the result of your actions.
Thank you a thousand.
Are you a person working in this area
That's why you can understand, you have to face a lot of problems
Sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the different words.
Every word has its own significance.
This year, the Government of India has started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take this.
Have we started a smooth India campaign
This will facilitate ease of doing business by developing all the infrastructure.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, parking, lifts, braille scripts, innovations are needed to facilitate them.
Technologies are needed and the system is needed to sensitize.
It's been trying to get public participation.
People like it.
The files shouldn't be moved before.
In fact, all the projects are for the common man and the poor.
The Government of India has conducted an investigation in the past about how to benefit the right rights of the schemes.
In our country, gas cylinders are provided subsidy.
It wasn't checked if you keep a proper number.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
As part of the Aadhaar Card, the mission is to direct the beneficiary's bank account through Jan Dhan Account through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
I am proud to say that the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme has been successfully ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
On one hand, Aadhaar Card Campaign, on the other hand, opening of Jan Dhan Account, and coordinating the list of beneficiaries by the Central State Governments and linking them to bank accounts through Aadhaar.
Now the money is directly deposited in the accounts of the workers.
There were complaints about students' scholarship and efforts have been made to solve it.
Approximately 40 crore rupees have reached the accounts of beneficiaries through various schemes.
Approximately thirty five to forty projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
In the Parliament, two days were shifted to a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are aware of most of the obligations during the election, and it is our duty to vote through publications and walls.
Why don't we advise us about the works in everyday life like the election time
On 26th January, on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, can the country organise discussions on the basis of work in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organizations
If 125 crore people walk one after the other and fulfill their work then it will be an unprecedented history.
Let's start the discussions.
You'll get the opportunity to go anywhere.
Festivals have their own importance in social life.
The news of natural disasters is constantly coming from every corner of the world.
We've never thought or imagined these dangers.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
The Central Government is also working with them on their shoulders.
However, the need for changes has to be considered while seeing such difficulties all around.
That's a good beginning.
Today, I received the phone message of Lakhvinder Singh from Jalandhar, Punjab, saying, I am speaking from Lakhvinder Singh and Jalandhar district of Punjab.
I am glad to hear Lakhvinder Singh's question.
The main reason for my happiness is that you're doing bio-farming.
Not only this, along with bio-farming, you understand the problems of farmers.
But it's not right to think that this happens only in Punjab and Haryana.
We are the nature of all Indians and we are following a traditional way to burn the ruins of crops.
We didn't have any sense of such losses.
Everyone does, we do it too.
Secondly, he didn't train how to do this.
But your concern is right.
But they're not real.
The ruins of crops are precious.
Secondly, how the surface of the earth goes through these fires.
We can't live if the heart is strong.
Likewise, if the fossils are burnt, not only the fossils are burnt by the earth's mother's skin.
Animals can also be used to protect our land.
Not only that, put the furnace from that land there, it gives double profits.
Once, I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who have made real farming.
They shared a good experience.
They had to spend five thousand, sixteen thousand and sixteen thousand hectares to remove the ruins of Wall after taking the crop.
The ruins of that potter will remain as long as people don't want to change the tracker.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of banana up to 6-8 inches on the earth.
Last time I discussed organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
He also spoke of the helpline of 'Chhachacha' for organ donation.
Several prominent personalities, including filmmaker Ravin Tandon, participated in this.
You can save many precious lives from organ donation.
In a way organ donation offers immortality.
When the body moves from one body to another, the organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What's more important than that
On 27th November, a National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation (NLT) was launched for those who donate organs to patients waiting for transplantation.
I believe that there will be widespread waking up in every constituency and in the true sense the needy will get the best support.
Everybody has to move forward for this.
As I have already suggested, I'm conducting the International Disability Day on December 3.
Physically and mentally distinguished are owners of incomparable will and courage.
I'm sorry when they're ridiculed.
We'll start crying when there's a little trouble.
When we think about how they live, our pain is so slight.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of living, their zeal to transform conflicts into capabilities are commendable.
Today I want to tell you about Javed Ahmed.
He's 40, 42 years old.
The terrorists shot him in Kashmir in 1996.
He was a victim of the gun of the extremists, but he survived amazingly.
But one of his kidneys lost a part of the intestine.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He lost his ability to stand on his feet forever, but he didn't fail.
The injury of extremism didn't hurt him.
How can we improve the connectivity of the physically handicapped and how to provide facilities in public and government offices.
Why is Javed's life sufficient to inspire every corner of India
I specially remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Because of lack of time, I am talking about Javed but such inspirations are brightening in every corner of India.
Our country is big.
There's a lot of things that are based on the government.
More than one experience changes our vision of the government's systems throughout the life.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
How many millions of people might be working around us like this.
If you see the patients with lovers, what's more pleasure than that
Are they partners in the sorrows of society
I congratulate all the ASHA workers of India who have been working like this in the name of 'Jamuna Mani'.
In addition to further discussions on 'e' books, some youth should tell students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and what is happening here.
And you're actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome you to the nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change.
The friend who guided me to sharing this unprecedented experience sent me a snake to see and feel it.
But if they say something they did, some other educational people wouldn't have thought of it.
They have been working with solar energy to bring light to the poor people in their area.
They foiled their name against the darkness.
They built a plant of Rantal, which was lighted by solar power through a women's association.
They're paying a ransom to the local residents for a rent of just a hundred rupees per month.
We know what the world's largest people are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much for the News.
But the beginning is very good.
42,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore) has been provided to 66 lakh people in a very short span of time.
Whether it is a labourer, a journalist or a breastfeeder, anybody employed will get the real benefit.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
The other is Shailesh Bhosla from Mumbai.
8. 5 lakh (8.
I had said during our Swachh Bharat programme that new entrepreneurship is coming into effect through that scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in carrying it on the path of action.
But many don't have enough information about this project.
How should the programme be structured
How do you want to be Logo
But I'm expecting a lot of suggestions.
Several basic projects are needed.
It will also provide a multiple document for the active partners.
Moreover, many other gifts have been announced.
My dear brothers, the winter has begun.
Make a good atmosphere in the family and make a festival and join everyone in exercise.
You will be able to know how much the blessings of consciousness are made by the exercise festival.
The whole day, the body will be more active.
If there's a good weather, there's a good nature.
My dear friends, you're once more good.
Jai Hind.
For the first time on October 3 last year, I was fortunate to present Mann Ki Baat.
One year through Mann Ki Ba.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
My experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme can be said that our ancestors have great strength and truth in this thought because I have experienced it.
Several issues have been brought from the bottom to the government.
And, it is true that the information from below to up and down has to come from top to bottom to bottom.
Did anybody ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
But it happened.
And that's how to show the strength of the Mann Ki Baat community.
I told you I was a day with selfie, and the whole world was surprised.
It was a silent revolution.
Millions of pictures have been sent by people from every corner of India.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Indian government or the state government have not thought that we have so much wealth.
Mann Ki Baat is a platform and people have worked for the government without spending one rupee.
I am happy to note about Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme before October last year.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October by encouraging and encouraging Khadi products across the country.
There was a time when I said Khadi for the nation.
Now, according to the change of time, don't you make it Khadi for fashion
I wanted you to buy Khadi from the people. I wanted to do something.
I'm happy to say that Khadi's sales almost doubled.
This wasn't the government's publicity.
It's not a profit spent on millions and crores.
A feeling of manpower, a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Baat, the poor smokes in the house, the children cry.
They need cooking gas cylinders
Today, I am happy to say that 30 lakh households in our country have left the gas subsidy.
I saw a retaired school teacher on the channel standing in uiyou to don't want a widowed woman subsidy.
The middle class, the lowest of them are hard to leave the subsidy.
But those people have left the subsidy.
Isn't this silent revolution
We can't see the manpower in this.
Our governments have to incorporate the lessons that there is a massive manpower, powerful and determined society beyond this framework.
What else to enjoy
I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
There is no place in India where people don't have phone calls.
It's a pleasant feeling.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking actions about the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But I am surprised and joyful.
Maybe we're all negative.
But my experience is hidden.
These fifty thousand people spoke their way.
How many common people of the country think about creatively, how big is it for the country
Perhaps only one or two phone calls are from the background of serious complaints.
More than 90 per cent was a pleasure in providing energy to the people.
They must have heard the radio.
I have sent a message from Alwar, Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, is that please call on the people of India to use the best moonlight for Deepawali through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will benefit the environment and create opportunities for thousands of soil utensils manufacturing sisters.
I believe that this feeling of yours will reach the corner and corner of India, like the Lord Acharya.
I tell the countrymen that if we implement the things that the Lord Acharya had said in the coming festivals, the lamps would be lighted in their homes, but the light would be spreading in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our armed forces to protect the ocean-corporation.
50 years of war with Pakistan in 1965.
In the name of this, a 'Sauryanjali' exhibition was organized at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to build history, it is important to know and understand the microscopes of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If the relationship with history is lost then there is a complete reference to the possibility of building history.
Don't show a brightness like me.
I went back in two and a half hours.
The boy's right.
And what happened, and I've been able to hear the arguments.
I don't think it's a bad thing, even in the good parliament that I have seen in it, there are discussions about the cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, on the other hand, Parliament, on the other hand, a child in this country, both speak about cleanliness and what is the greatest fortune for one country
This revolution of ideas creates an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt and has become aware of cleanliness.
It will compel the governments to work.
We must take this task to realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If there is an opportunity to choose one of them, then I will first choose cleanliness and then freedom.
Gandhiji had given the importance of cleanliness more than independence.
Gulshan Arora MyGov from Delhi.
I want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear friends, the lives of great men always inspire us.
Our work is not to assess which great men were followers of thoughts.
We inspire every person who lives and dies for the country.
These days there are opportunities to remember many great men.
On September 25, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Scientists on October 11, Jaiprakash Narayan and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on October 31, I am very few.
I am particularly moving forward on 2nd October.
If it is beneficial, even if it gives equal significance to handloom with Khadi.
The neighbour's brothers are teaching a lot.
The poor widow built by Khadi will reach home.
Therefore, this Deepawali will surely give a place to everybody's houses and body.
Look, last time the sale has almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to be in one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to see me.
Her maiden had arranged everything.
I got the opportunity to spend a lot of money with the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose.
"My name is Bhargavi.
I would like to tell you that the youth should be aware of the registration of voters and that is why in the coming days, the participation of the youth will increase and the participation of the youth in the elections and governance will increase in the future.
Thank you, Bhargavi said that the issues of enrollment and voting are in the voter list.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India on this issue.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electronics Commission was only a regulator, but for the last few years it has made a big change.
It's a very good change, but it's not a matter of fact that the Election Commission has been working.
Normally, I want to say that vote before the election day and drink.
One, a seven-year-old man studys in the 7th grade of the Central School of Hindu University of Banaras, Kshitij Pandey.
I want to increase scientific and interest in our country's children.
At the age of 9.
When she asked her father, she said she's been saying all this since 5 years.
I asked you, where did you learn
So I thought I wanted to share with you.
We're doing a lot of things you see on TV and don't know through newspapers.
What's the casualty to do once a month
Friends from the sky have to wait for me for half an hour.
It's a month's expedition right now.
It was from Germany and instructed the citizens of Hindustan through radio on the freedom movement.
Azad Hind Radio was launched through the weekly newsball.
He was broadcasting in languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed a year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through the sky.
We'll meet in Mann Ki Baat next month.
Let your suggestions come.
Your suggestions are beneficial.
It starts a good change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has spoken to the people of India on 30th August 2015 at 11 o'clock in the morning.
I've got an opportunity to present things in my mind before you.
On this occasion, the whole country celebrated me the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common man.
All the dignitaries have adopted these schemes for a very short time.
I had requested our sisters to implement security measures on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I see this as a good sign.
All mothers and sisters celebrate the auspicious festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year ago, I had provided the Jan Dhan Yojana to a large number of people to talk to you.
The banking sector is the main source of the economy and the bank friendly scheme has been designed to reach out to the poor.
Today, more than one and a half lakh bank friends are working throughout the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You must be happy to hear that within a year, one lakh and a half thousand economic awareness camps have been set up to connect the banking sector with the economic system and the poor.
I've put these things in front of you, and now it's your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts are efficient.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the Sufi traditional scholars.
Their voices and their interactions, i. e. generosity and beauty in the Sufi tradition, are the keys of music.
I am glad that they invited me to Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
I'll get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars all over the world.
It will be a pleasant moment for me, my dear Krishak brothers and sisters, I want to talk about my mind again.
It's already mentioned about these issues.
You might have heard me in the Parliament, you might have heard in the General Assembly Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you don't have to be afraid.
I don't want anybody to give this opportunity.
We were in the middle of an Ordinance.
The Ordnance's term ends tomorrow on 31st August.
I've decided to finish if it's over.
My farming brothers and sisters, "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan" is not just a map for us but I want to make you a mantra of ours.
I want to tell you another thing.
Two days ago, 50 years of the 1965 war were completed.
Whenever you remember this war in 1965, Lal Bahadur is a memorable routine.
It will also recall his sympathy of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is natural to remember all the martyrs of India's Tricolor and its significance and success.
I bow to all those associated with the victory of the 65 war.
I bow down to the heroes.
Such moments of history are inspiring us.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi tradition, I got the opportunity to interact with the leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their suggestions.
India is showcasing the best practices in various fields of science and I am happy to be here.
Our scientists actually do great things.
How to get such research to the common man
How should we use these principles at a reasonable level
I have said in Mann Ki Baat that we need to lead our students to the field of science.
I thought there were many opportunities and opportunities after this discussion.
I want to say something special to my dear young friends.
There are many guests from all over the world who have visited India in the recent past.
Why don't we connect our festivals with cleanliness
This year the beginning of rain was good.
In our country, there are combinations of food grains, oilseeds and peacocks.
The poor need food for eating and oil for cooking vegetables.
However, this time the crops are very happy and this year around 50 percent of the food habits and 33 percent of the oilseeds have increased.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters because of this.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked in the history of our country as a victory day in Kargil.
The more the farmers of the country are connected to the earth, the more they are connected to the soldiers and the nation.
Each of our soldiers in the war in Carg has come to a hundred enemies.
India can speak today in front of the world as a result of all these collective sacrifices.
That's why my hundreds of greetings to our brave soldiers today on the victory day of Kargil.
Smt. Sutratrakhavachari, Chennai, has sent several suggestions.
I believe you all will send good instructions.
I want to clarify my vision of one thing.
I don't want to give any advice, but I don't find ways to liberate the State Governments or the Central Governments or the NGOs from their offices.
Two days ago, I had noticed the scene of a vehicle accident in Delhi and even after 10 minutes, the scooter travellers were on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, a lot of people write to me by extending these issues that you should make people aware about road safety issues.
Be it Hoskot residents of Bangalore, be it a renowned hub of Mundubidri in Karnataka, I don't remember the names of all.
Every accident happens every day in our country for a minute.
One death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most sad thing is that about one-third of the deaths are young people between 15 and 25, each of whom is captured by the whole family.
Another thing that I remember is a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh and they have touched my mind with their work.
'Brother No. 1' is an excellent brother to give his sister a toilet on the day of Rakshabandhan.
Inspire all such brothers and make toilets for their sisters, so mothers and sisters in the entire district don't have to make excretion open.
Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh is a small village of labour.
The people of that village have started and completed the scheme for construction of toilets for the last few months.
Now nobody in that village has to defecate in an open place.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems of the North-Eastern states from Guwahati.
It is also decided that a seven-day camp will be organized in Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a team of Central Government officers will go to the North-Eastern States.
The results of this effort will be in the coming days.
The lack of apprehension for science is very embarrassing.
In a way, science and technology are the aims of development.
Our IAS officers have learnt a lot of things and they must always interact with the children of school or college around two or four hours a week and their experiences are their strength.
We have started it and in the coming years our villages will get electricity for 24 hours.
Don't bother the children of the village while studying in the examination days.
If there is a need to start small and big industries in the villages then there is a need for electricity.
Today, they have to go to the next village if they want to charge mobile.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
That is why, Din Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme was launched.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I have asked my heart to talk about every Indian.
Similarly, the months of August and September are the times of celebrations.
We have many festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
While sitting in the midst of the needy, in the peaceful environment, many of the people of 130 crore people were talking to the family, many were heard.
Perhaps it's inspiring to those who need their own things.
I just used my words, but I didn't think I didn't think it was you.
I felt a quietness.
Anyway, it's the last chance.
'Man Ki Baat', 'Man Ki Baat', 'Man Ki Baat' in a family.
Let us continue this programme in a way by giving birth to a new agent, giving birth to changes in society and life.
There have been many messages in the last months, in which people said, 'Mann Ki Baat' is sorry.
Sometimes I think this is a journey from my 'self' to 'self' satisfaction.
It's from me to Nami.
My interaction with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
For me, I had the opportunity to meet me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes my thoughts are inspired by the process and sometimes encouraging it.
When people are in front of the challenges faced by the nation and the society, they also suggest solutions.
In the letters, people explain the problems, and say peace and some suggestions, some imagination, some or the other or the other.
That is, in your words, I am aware of how to get peace from the society in a way.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and society.
It tells us that there is less spiritual power, strength or prosperity in the people.
They have to unite the strength and the achievements, give them the opportunity, they have to be implemented.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people are strong and active in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy my mind is when I imagine these things.
This belief was the bottom of your faith.
With this feeling, let's continue 'Man Ki Baat'.
Therefore, not for the country, but for self-reliance, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps in any country in the world, the people there would not have voted for democracy, their residue rights, powers and requirements, just for democracy.
That's how the country saw in 1977.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and we think this number is normal.
But if this is the population around the world, it will be seen that more than one country except China has voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than the population of America, almost twice.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This demonstrates the vastness and variety of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections in 2019 were the largest democratic elections in the world.
You can imagine how large wealth and human power are required to conduct such elections.
This election was conducted by millions of teachers, officers and other gatherings.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces have been responsible for successful conduct of this campaign of democracy, and 20 lakh police personnel from different states have worked and worked hard.
As a result of all these hardships, more people came to vote this time than the first time.
In order to vote, more than 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh distribution machines have come across the country.
You can think about how big you're ready.
A voter can't use his vote, and that's what he did.
In a far-flung area of Arunachal Pradesh, only a female voter has been set up for the polling station.
You will be surprised to hear that the electorate had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at a height of Lahol - Spiti in Himachal Pradesh .
In this election, the percentage of votes for women and men was almost the same.
It is another fact that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament to reduce history.
The Election Commission and all those associated with the turnover programme are commendable and bow down to the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you've often heard me saying, 'Boke not book'.
I said, to welcome people, use a book instead of flowers.
Since then, people have started giving books somewhere.
His stories include all the psychological disorders of India.
When he was reading the story of 'Nasha', my mind turned to the economic inequality that is spread in the society.
I remember the days I was a young man.
It came to the mind how the discussions took place overnight.
If you don't keep yourself aware of the stories of Ishwari, the son of Jamindar, and the beer of the poor family, you don't know when the impact of the bad collaboration is stuck.
A sensitive child has an incomplete love for his grandmother, a feeling that he has made at his younger age.
We really see human sensitivity reached Parama, when we took from Hamid Festival at the age of 4-5, and brought it to Grandma.
Happy to the farmer Haldu after losing the crop, you don't have to sleep in the field in the winter.
These stories are about a hundred years ago, but we still feel the same.
K.
Mr. Muralidhar and P.
Today, this library is a guide for all, including tribal children.
In Gujarat, a successful test was conducted by the name of 'Wanche Gujarat'.
Millions of people from all ages have participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, in the days of Google Guru, I have to find some time to invoke you and give some time to books in your daily routine.
You will feel better and you must write the book reading on the Narendra Modi App, so let all the listeners of Mann Ki Baatti know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country think about the issue of challenges not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your suggestions on 'Narendramodi App' and 'My GOV... many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Gaurai, Pawan of Balgaon, Sithamshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar and Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless yourself as a mother, and be gracious to us.
Water deficiency affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available in the rainy season is available throughout the year.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
With the participation of people like other problems, we will find solutions to this problem with the ability, cooperation and determination of one and a half million people with the strength of the people.
The Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has been set up in the country with greater emphasis on water.
It will take decisions on all water related issues.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers across the country.
I wrote that to protect water, to save water, to see every rain and to call the people of the village, to think with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done it and have made millions of efforts in thousands of Panchayats on 22nd of this month.
The people of the villages took a pledge to collect every drop of water.
Today, on Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to what message the village chief of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us: "My name is Shri Kumar Ravidas, and we do not believe that when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we have written such a letter.
People there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the villagers and all the villagers in the name of their enthusiasm.
The people of the village are now competing to build a temple for water in their villages.
As I said, social efforts can make positive changes.
None of the country will be able to afford any synonymous with the problem of water.
In many ways, efforts are being made in different ways.
But everyone's goal is to protect water, water conservation.
Drinking lines are doing well in Punjab.
This effort will help in prevention of floods.
The lives of the villagers have changed through the construction of tanks in Thamizar in Telugu.
In Kabir Dham, Rajasthan, small ponds built in the field of agriculture have made a big change.
I read a social venture in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women gathered to revive the Nag river.
In collaboration with each other, he also read about women in Gwaal, who have worked well for rain water conservation.
I am confident that this kind of effort is being made by I believe that it is impossible to make a strong effort by collaborating.
When people gather together, water will be waited.
I say that water is touching, the touch of that touch will create a new life through the touch of water.
To protect every drop of water, 'One Water Conservation' can be organized.
It can also tell about water related problems and also promote water conservation systems.
I especially urge the remarkable personalities in different fields to conduct a separate campaign for water conservation.
People belonging to the film sector, sports sector, media, friends, social organisations, people belonging to cultural organisations, singing singing sports, should be led by this birthplace in their own way.
Let's wake up the society, unite the society, join the society.
Look, we can see changes in our eyes.
I urge you to share information on the traditional methods of water conservation.
If you have an opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of the revered father, you must see another house behind the father's house, where there is a 200-year-old water reservoir, which still has water.
There's a plan to stop rain water.
I always say those who go to the Kirti Mandir must see the reservoir.
Several types of water reservoirs are in place.
You and yourselves have information to share with you using the Hashta4alShakti Hashtag.
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my gratitude to you and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, when the sun rises all over the world, those who love Yoga welcome the sun, it is a journey till the sun sets.
The Prime Ministers, well-known people and common people from all over the world showed how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
The world looked like a big satisfactory family.
We all know that a healthy and sensitive person is required to build a healthy society and that is why Yoga is sure.
Therefore, the practice of Yoga is an important thing related to social service.
Isn't such a service acceptable and respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Minister's Award for those who have played an important role in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You will not be able to imagine that the awards have been given to the greatest organisations all over the world and they have played an important role in spreading Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan, where many institutes and training courses are being conducted.
Miss Italy.
There are very inspirational examples before us.
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and has been dedicated to Yoga for the last decade.
He also honoured Swami Rajarshi Muni and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yeah.
I'll wait for your instructions.
It's a great journey for me to join your thoughts. Mann Ki Baat is only for me.
Come on, let's be together, let's share the ideas.
I'm listening to your mind, let's keep it, let's understand it.
Sometimes try to live with your feelings.
You must be blessed.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come, let us share the joy of Mann Ki Baatti and fulfill the responsibility of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
(MASS: 53rd Luck) Namaskars to the well-known countrymen.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for 125 crore Indians.
People can sleep peacefully, our brave sons waited day and night.
At the same time, the attackers have responded in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place in 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, there was a sense of encouraging response from their families through media, which enhances the spirit of the entire country.
It is inspiring to all of us to express the grief of Ram Tarunjanji, father of Dhirjan Ratna Thakur, Bhagalpur, Bihar.
The nation salutes the brave courage of the martyr of Prasanna Saheb's wife Meenaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
Swears that one of the only sons to join the CRPF.
This is what we see in every house of our brave and brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youth that the feelings of these families, their minds, try to understand.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
Ladies and gentlemen, war memorials are being witnessed in this long period since independence.
It is natural for people to have curiosity and enthusiasm in this regard.
It is heartening to note that on the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty, from Utti, Karnataka, has completed the National War Memorial.
I was surprised to know that there was no longer a National War Memorial in India.
There was a war memorial to depict the brave legends of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am glad that it is decided to build a National War Memorial and it is completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow i. e.
The country will make a small effort to cross the ocean.
This new monument is built near the heart of Delhi, that is, India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I believe that going to this National Army Memorial will be equal to going to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the country's gratitude to the great martyrs after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the valuable courage of our dead soldiers.
The National Military Memorial has been designed in three categories, out of which the journey from birth to martyrdom has been drawn.
The flame of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the death of the martyrs.
The second cycle shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This trend shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
The names of the greatest martyrs for the country are recorded in gold letters.
Thereafter, there's a rescue cycle that demonstrates security.
This tree will see the layers of dense trees.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was also a reflection of the thought that the country should be grateful to the male and female police who are constantly teaching for our security.
I am confident that you will definitely come to see the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures taken from there on social media and inspire others, they will be keen to see these memorials.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have been receiving thousands of letters and suggestions for Mann Ki Baa through several media.
On March 3, the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
They are both individuals from different family backgrounds that have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baa, it is like bowing down to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have increased not only in Jharkhand but also in the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution to the nation.
Do you know why the English took such a brave path
Because even the Englishman who built such a big empire was scared of him, Mr.
Birsa bowed down to the British rule that used guns and cannons using her traditional umbrella and villa.
Birsa has not only fought the English for national freedom but also for the social and economic independence of the tribals.
He did this in his short life.
He brightened the sun in the dark life of the denying and the oppressed.
At the age of 25, he sacrificed himself.
The brave sons of Bharat Baba, like Birsa Munda, have become everywhere in the country.
There will be no reason for India's brother who has not participated in this centuries old freedom struggle.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence, then the personalities like Jamshedji Tattas have been presented to the country as big institutions.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and it should be a business centre.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his vision.
He also set up world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Meeting between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda on the ship during the visit to America.
It is said that this discussion was possible to establish the Indian Institute of Science.
Ladies and gentlemen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Mr.
As you all know, this day comes only once in four years.
Morarjibhai, the owner of liberal, peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders in the country.
Morarji had the privilege of presenting the budget most of the time in the Parliament of India.
In the name of this, he had to pay for old age.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
However, he became the Prime Minister of the country when he won the Janata Party elections in 1977.
This is the amendment of the 44th Amendment, which recommended the procedures of the Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies to be published in newspapers.
It revised some of the Supreme Court's powers and added that the fundamental rights obtained by Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution could not be abolished even during the period.
Asked by the Cabinet, the President can declare the condition of the state and the term of the state of the state cannot be extended once more than six months.
In 1975, by announcing an unprecedented situation, the murder of democracy would not repeat in the future.
The future generation will recall his great contribution to maintaining the gloriousness of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay homage to that great leader.
My dear people, this time, like every year, there is enthusiasm among the people about the Padma awards.
They bring positive changes in the lives of others in different ways on the strength of their teaching.
It's a great thing to bring a rare painting to the new level.
I have presented a gift to former US President Barrackson, a artistic tree of life, built by Abdul Gaffur.
Among those who received the Padma Awards, Shabbir Said Gomata of Marathwada is known as the servant.
You will be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Inch in America, and the linch is now a big institution for Yoga.
It is a matter of great privilege that they have tried to connect technology with agriculture and dear people, 12 of those awarded this year's Padma awards are farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with agriculture have reached the list of Padma Shri.
The present change is a life-style picture of changing India.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I'm going to tell you something like a heartfelt.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about twelve lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I saw how big it brings about in the lives of the poor.
If you know anybody who cannot be treated because of lack of money, tell them about this plan.
This scheme is for such poor people, dear people, the time of examination in schools is going to start.
In the next few weeks across the country, the examinations of various education boards, clusters and twelveth grade will be started.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to write the examination.
A few days ago, a big programme was organized at the Town Hall in Delhi to mark the exams.
I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers from across the country and abroad with the help of technology in this townhouse.
I'm talking to millions of households in a way through radio every month.
I think you are part of my family when you are talking to you and reading your letters and listening to your suggestions sent by the phone.
It gives me a very comfortable feeling.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
I've been telling you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
This month, on 21st, a very sad news was received by the country.
Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji became a disabled person in the Siddhganga monastery in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shivkumaraswamy dedicated his entire life to social service.
Bhagwan Basaveswar has taught us - Kayakuve Kailas, that is, to perform his work hardly, is equal to being in the habitation of Lord Shiva in Kailas.
Shivkumar Swamiji was a follower of this darshan.
He worked for the socio-educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people in his 111 years of life.
He was an eminent man in English, Sanskrit and Canada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his entire life to provide food, home, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His preference was all kinds of good for the farmers.
Siddhaganga monastery was regularly organising cattle-cultural fairs .
I have been fortunate to have received the blessings of Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb heard a poem about revered Swamiji on this occasion.
Once again, I pay homage to that great soul.
Ladies and gentlemen, on 26 January, 1950, the Constitution was in the midst of our nation.
Our country on that day, for the Republic.
Yesterday we celebrated Republic Day.
But I want to tell you something else.
January 25 was the establishment day of the Election Commission and this day is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the massive election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission to see that our Election Commission is doing it well.
In the Gir forest of Gujarat, you must have heard that only one voter has a polling fool.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I compliment the Election Commission, which is constantly working to strengthen our democracy.
Congratulations to the Election Commission and the security officers of all the States, who are participants in the election process, to ensure free and unsuccessful elections.
This year the Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This is the first time that youngsters born in the twentieth century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have had the opportunity to tackle the responsibility of the country.
They're going to decide the division of the country.
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I call upon the younger generation to register as a voter if it's older to vote.
And we have to think that voting is our duty.
Whenever there is no vote for any reason in life, it must be a pain.
I'm sorry to see something wrong in the country.
Our country is a brilliant man.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great personalities.
On 23rd January, the country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who have participated in the freedom of India.
Some rooms and buildings were locked in the Red Fort since independence.
The locked rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, the museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum smells the smell of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum reflects the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle and inspires us to go to history.
At this very place, the English regime was prosecuted against the brave sons of India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gur Baksh Dhillon and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I kept that hat in the museum and let the visitors also see that hat from which the inspiration of patriotism is inspired.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must be repeated in different ways to the new generation.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I flagged off the Triple Talaq 75 years ago, as part of a programme.
Likewise, everybody will be surprised to have a thrilled flag hoisting in the Red Fort in October, 2018, as it is a regular flag hoisting on 15th August.
Today, the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Azad Hind Government was celebrated.
Netaji gained momentum in the hearts of all Indians through the maps like Delhi Chalo, Tum Khun Do, Mum Tumumum Asadi Dumga (Delhi, bleed you, I will give you freedom).
Over the years, the need to provide files related to Netaji to the public has been raised.
I'm glad I could do it.
I remember the day Netaji's family came together to the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that in Delhi, efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great people of India.
Whether it is 26 Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir, it is a pleasure.
If you come to Delhi, you must go to visit these places.
My dear countrymen, when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He also chose radio to interact with the people, and in 1942, Subhash Baba Azad Hind Radio started.
I believe that this radio station was broadcasting the newspapers throughout the week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Home Affairs, Shri M.
R.
Vyas played a great role.
The general public liked the programmes that were broadcast in Azad Hind Radio.
The programmes were encouraging the freedom fighters.
In this Kranti Mandir there is also a visitor art museum .
They have tried to describe Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historic exhibitions in the museum where more than 450 paintings and other art forms of three centuries old have been kept .
The museum showcases the excellence of great artists like King Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy and Cylos Mukherjee.
I urge you all to go there to see the compositions of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You think I'm talking about art, why do you want to see the great scriptures of Gurudev Tagore
You may have known about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, many natural scenes, and he has invented human nature in the canvas through art.
It is worth mentioning that Gurudev didn't name many of his writings.
He thought that those who saw his pictures should understand the paintings in which he had given the message through his own vision.
His pictures have been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our magnificent manifestations are a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
That was a great saint Ravidas.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
Saint Ravidas ji's misdeeds are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he was trying to recognise the importance of teaching and teaching people throughout his life.
In our space programmes, many young scientists of the country have contributed to the space programme.
We are proud that today our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets have reached space.
On January 24, Kalam Sat, who made our students, was distributed.
The sounding rockets made by students in Odisha are also setting up a new record.
The country has launched space missions in the last four years since independence to 2014.
We have set up a world record of launching 104 satellites through a single aircraft.
We will soon be going to ensure India's presence in the moon through Chandrayaan two.
Our country is using space technology to protect the lives and lives of the people.
Whether it is climate change, Railways or Road Safety, there is a lot of support for space technology in all.
We have distributed naval devices among our fisheries brothers, which are helpful in their safety and economic growth.
We are using space technologies to deliver government services to the people and to ensure its responsibility effectively.
About 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been tagged under the Housing for All (Housing for All) scheme.
At the same time, about three and a half crore earthquakes have been tagged under Mandega.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India is launching satellites not only of developing countries but also of developing countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive to the children.
Our space programmes are likely to think of children as bigger and beyond the boundaries that are still impossible.
It is also a perspective to monitor the stars for our children and to inspire new stars.
6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sportspersons at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
This time in Khelo India, players from all States have performed well in their own way.
The lives of many medal winners are inspiring.
I read that Akash's father, Akash ji, was working as a guardian in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shade with his family.
Likewise, the captain of the 21 Women's Cabdi team of Maharashtra is a man living in Sonali Helvi Satara.
They lost their father at a very young age and encouraged brother and mother Sonali's capability.
It is generally seen that girls don't get encouragement to participate in games like Kabadi.
But Sonali chose the cabins, showed the best performance.
Abhinav Shah, the 10-year-old Assamese, is the youngest in the Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter, Akshata Baswanikamati, won a gold medal in the weightlifting of Karnataka.
We must remember that when we talk about the creation of India, the vision of a New India is young.
These stories of Khelo India not only contribute to the creation of a New India but also to the youth and children from small towns and villages and towns and young sports skills.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of many beautiful festivals you have named.
But have you heard of a beautiful competition for toilets
More than 5000 toilets participated in this strange event for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the villagers to lead this movement in my Panchayat.
You must share your pictures of your clean beautiful toilets with Mylathar on the media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a memorable journey to defecate in the open space with the aim of defecation free of the country.
My child friends, the days of the exam are coming.
Anshul Sharma MyGov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, says, I want to talk about exams and exams.
Anshul ji thanked him for taking this matter into account.
Yes, the first part of the year is the test season for many families.
I would like to discuss this matter in Mann Ki Baat today, but on 29th January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, there will be discussions with students from all over the country along with parents and teachers.
This time students from other countries are also participating in the event.
I will talk to young friends about all aspects of the examination, especially the stress-free exam.
I will surely put some of these suggestions and suggestions in front of you during the event at the Town Hall.
You must participate in this program.
You'll see through the media or the Namo App Ludey, communicating it in the morning.
Ladies and gentlemen, January 30 is the memory of the revered father.
The country will pay homage to the martyrs at 11 o'clock.
We must pay homage to two minutes of martyrs everywhere.
Remember the revered Bapu, fulfilling his dreams, creating a New India, ensuring that his work is being done as citizens.
This journey of 2019 will be successfully carried forward.
Greetings to all of you, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
It's going to end 2018.
We are entering 2019.
Obviously, this time, we can also hear discussions about the hopes of the coming year as well as the discussions of last year.
Whether it is the life of the person or the life of the society or the life of the country, everybody has to look back and look as much as possible.
This is the achievement of experiences and the confidence to do many new things.
What can we contribute to bringing about changes in our lives and taking the country and society forward
I extend my best wishes to you all for 2019.
As a result of the vision of the people of the country, the value of cleanliness is reaching 95.
After independence, the first time from the Red Fort hoisted the Tricolor on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering of the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, on the eve of his visit to the United Nations.
Indias efforts in the field of solar energy and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance, the first edition of International Solar Alliance, was held in India.
Our country has had unprecedented excellence in Ease of Doing Business Rankings.
Our girls have enhanced the pride of the country by embracing the world through the navigational ocean.
The countrys first waterway started in Varanasi.
It has started a new revolution in the waterways sector.
Bogibeel Bridge, the country's longest rail-road bridge, was dedicated to the nation, the first and the country's 100th airport in Pakyong.
Under 19 Cricket World Cups and Blind Cricket World Cup, India won.
This time India has won a lot of medals in Asian Games.
India also performed well in Para Asian Games.
If all Indian social endeavours begin to be listed then our Mann Ki Baat will be longer than 2019.
All this was possible because of the unbelievable efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey will continue in 2019 and the progress of India and our country will be able to achieve new heights.
Ladies and gentlemen, we lost some of our specific bonds in December.
Dr. Jaichandran was known as the best treatment provider for the poor.
Similarly, on 25th December, Sulagiti Narasma died in Karnataka.
Sulagiti Narasamy was helping pregnant mothers and sisters in delivery.
They provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
There are many inspirational people like Jaichandra and Sulagiti Narasamy.
They have dedicated their lives to the well-being of everyone in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, we want to talk about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are walking in the camp and treating the poor.
Heart Lungs Critical Centre is organised every month in Medical Camps where there are several diseases and free check-ups.
Today hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
These doctors, who are serving selflessly, must appreciate the enthusiasm of friends.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful movement only through social efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people have come together in the cleanliness programme in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
City Corporation, Service Organisations, School-College students and people from Jabalpur were enthusiastically participating in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm the Betterindia.
When I got the opportunity, I'm sure to go to the Betterindia.com to know about such inspirations.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us many stories that inspire us to live.
com is trying to promote positivity in the SAT society and to make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, the story of the success of industrial innovators and young innovators tells us a lot.
Don't combine the possibilities.
I believe that more and more people know about our dogs that bring about changes in the society.
It's easy to spread negativeity.
But in our society, we have a lot of good things that can be achieved through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hannah is 12, lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hannah learned and concentrated, learnt about its different heads, proved himself capable.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
Hania has a lot of good wishes and blessings.
Likewise, a 16-year-old child and Rajini had a lot of discussions in the media.
You must have read.
Rajini Junior Girl Gusti won the gold medal at Championship.
As soon as Rajni got the medal, the child went to the nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that Rajini medal was covered in a cloth and put in the bag.
You might think why Rajni had a glass of milk.
The boy did it, and he was honouring Jasmersing and selling lymph at a stall in Panipa.
Rajni said that the father had suffered a lot in bringing the kid to this stage and had suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh and his brothers are going to work before waking up in the morning.
When Rajni Boxing wanted to learn, when she told her that she had organised all the possible things and encouraged her.
Rajnik Gosti Training had been tied to old glasses because the family's economic condition was very bad at that time.
Though all these obstacles, Rajini didn't get excited, she had to learn.
I got a medal from Serbia.
This month, 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni in Pune has become the fastest growing man in the world.
The kid traveled 300 km daily on a cycle of 159 days.
The excitement of the child is surely admirable.
We don't get inspired to hear about such capabilities.
My best wishes to our fathers, farmers, sisters and sisters.
The smell of diversity, unity and ideas like Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is filled in our festivals.
There is no difference between society and nature in Indian culture, and there is only one person and satisfaction.
The calendar, based on festivals, is a good example of our close ties with nature.
This will provide information about the existence of planets and stars along with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided which calendar is overlooked.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planets in many areas.
Gudi Padwa, Chadichand and Ugadi are celebrated according to the moon calendar, while Tamil Putant, Vishnu, Vishakha, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar.
It is seen that in many of our festivals, the feeling of watching rivers and water is particularly inherent.
The Chhath festival is related to sun worship in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On one hand, they have archaeological significance and on the other hand, all the festivals inspire us to live with the text of life and harmony of each other.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for 2019 and wish you all the best to celebrate the coming festivals with full heart.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country come and participate in the Kumbh Mela.
In the Kumbh, the masses of faith and devotion are shared.
Together, millions of people from across the country and abroad come together.
The tradition of Kumbh has spread in our great cultural heritage.
This time, from 15th January, you will also be waiting for the world famous Kumbh Mela to be celebrated in Prayagraj.
Saint Mahatmayakal has begun to reach Kumbh.
It's a great proof that the UNESCO is on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity to enable Manisila to have global importance.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries saw preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There were flags of nations from many countries.
People from over 150 countries are going to visit this Kumbh in Prayagraj.
In particular, it is a big study study for the youth.
I went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw the preparations for the Kumbh in fervour.
This time, we are giving a lot of importance to cleanliness.
There will be devotional devotion and the message will reach far and wide.
This time devotees can visit Akshayvad after the sacred bath at Sangam.
This Akshayvad, a symbol of the faith of the people, has been shut in the fort for centuries, so the devotees could not see if they wished.
This time it's all allowed to enter there.
You must also participate in the Kumbh Festival and showcase the pictures of different heads in the middle of the society so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
The spiritual Kumbh will be the greatest of Indian vision.
The Kumbh of faith is the greatest of nationality.
The Kumbh of Artificial Intelligence and the Great Powers.
Ladies and gentlemen, on the occasion of the Republic Day celebrations on 26th January, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of the people and on that day we recall the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we celebrate the hundredth birth anniversary of revered father.
South African President Mr.
Sirial Ramaphosa is reaching India as the Chief Guest on the Republic Day this year.
There was an indefinite relationship between revered father and South Africa.
Her Majesty was from this South Africa.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi launched his first Satyagraha and remained a strong resistance to diversity.
He set up Finnics and Tolstoy Families from where peace and justice all over the world swept away.
He had the power and inspiration to be in prison for so many years.
He wrote about Mandela Bapu, Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because he started examining experiments here.
This is where he showed his firm guidance for justice, where he raised the vision of Satyagraha and the methods of fighting.
He saw Bapu as a roll model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only inspirational to the world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
Ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, the conferences of DGPs were organised at Kevadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where the highest statue of the world is Statue of Unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He always lived in conserving India's universe.
Sardar Saheb thought that the strength of India depends on the diversity here.
He pays homage to Sardar Saheb by this award for unity.
Ladies and gentlemen, January 13 is the pious day of Guru Gobind Singh's birth anniversary.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
For a long time, his workplace was North India and he killed his life in the naming of Maharashtra.
In the birthplace of Patna, the Karmabhoomi of North India, the last minute of life in Namdede.
In a way, the whole of India got his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji at the age of 9, after being martyred by Guru Tej Bahadur ji.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a peaceful and compassionate personality, but whenever he tried to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji lifted his voice to the poor and the weak, he said: "Sawa Lakshe Ek Lada Umchidio and Som Baj Tudda Gobind Singh Nam Kahla.
He was a divine man full of bravery, bravery, sacrifice and serenity.
He was an alarming weaponry and astrology.
As a warrior, Gurumukhi, Brazil, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and other languages were known.
I once again bow to Guru Govind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good incidents in the country but there are no detailed discussions about them.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion.
The event will take place on 27th January.
It is a matter of appreciation that I am trying to get awareness and knowledge across the country.
When India is clean, it is prosperous.
It is nutritious for good health.
To start this thing.
It is important to learn lessons about the importance of food in childhood.
Come on, let's move forward to achieve new heights for new inspiration and zeal and determination. Let's change ourselves and change the country.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Patna and Vikas Mandav from Patna, Monica Jean from Delhi, Burdwan from West Bengal and music scientists from Nagpur, etc. asked about the same question.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technologies, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It happened in 1998.
I was working in Himachal as an organizational worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
May was the month.
It was a little dabba.
I didn't understand anything.
Look at me, he said, look, Sab, listen to the radio.
In the next time, he did a survey about Manki Baat.
Some of them are very funny.
In the survey, only 70 percent of the people listen to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most people think that Mann Ki Baat has grown positively in the society.
Man Kiba has encouraged many generations.
There were widespread discussions on India Positive.
I am happy to see that the radio is more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets Mike, if millions of people have to hear, what do you want
They find out that there's no politics in this program.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it was decided that there would be no politics, it would not be the benefits of the government and it would not be Modi.
You were the most inspired in implementing my determination.
Small stories of 130 crore people will always remain.
This country will take new inspiration and enthusiasm to new heights.
When I read the letter, a feeling like that shouts in my mind.
With two words, I share it with you in my experience.
When will a government get the strength to start the Selfie seed dollar programme in a small village in Haryana, not only across the country but abroad
People from all sections of the society, who are known as celebrity, have joined with it and made the ideas of the society awake in a new language that today's generation understands.
Man Kibat is not a matter of the government, but a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of progress in India.
The life of India is not political, it is not kingdom.
India's life is social justice, social strength.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If it's all political, it's not good for the society.
Sometimes, political events and political activity, and other talents of the society and their livelihoods are suppressed.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy job for me.
People's letters come before all the Mann Ki Baats.
My effort is to see the maximum number of letters before Mann Ki Baat and read the commanders.
They hear a lot of phone calls.
I read the ideas and inputs that you are sending during the journey as per Mann Kibat's episode.
So, whenever he reads a letter, the circumstance of the burner turns into a part of my thoughts.
The letter is not a piece of marble for me.
In the last 40-45 years, I have lived the lives of an infamous man and most of the districts of the country have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
Efforts are also being made to focus on the instructions of the letters that cannot be included in the Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and TV media.
Because of their efforts, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
Akashwani's team is ready to broadcast all the episodes in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat with the same feeling as Modi in the local language.
That's how they turn into Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes to them for their capabilities and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in local languages.
I would like to thank friends from the media that listens to Mann Ki Baat every month in their channels.
A person in politics is not satisfied with the media, they feel that they are getting less coverage and if they get coverage then it is a negative coverage.
If there were no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'm done in all the families.
It's easier to understand if the old sheep of our own life don't come in the middle.
One doesn't understand that he has abandoned his thoughts and accepted his thoughts.
The specialty of today's youth is that they don't do any self-confidence, if they believe in something then they leave it and follow it.
Sometimes people can listen to the discussions about the emotional release of youngsters in the households.
In fact, the limit of talking to the youth in most families is very narrow.
Do not do that for longer learning, or for habits, for lifestyle.
Through various programmes, I have been trying to continuously interact with the youth through social media.
I'm trying to learn from them what they're doing, what they think.
They've always had a feeling of ideas.
They are very powerful, innovative and concentrating.
Through Man Kiba, I am trying to add more to the problems of the youth and their things.
Sometimes there are complaints that the youth are asking more questions.
I say it's better to ask you questions.
We feel that today's youths are very ambitious and think very big things.
It is good to see big dreams and to achieve greater achievements. This is essentially a New India, a New India.
Some say young people want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking you what's wrong with this.
It's because they're capable of multi-tasking.
If we look around, it is social initiatives, startups, sports or other sectors, the youth are bringing about big changes in the society.
Young people daring to ask questions and to see new dreams.
If the ideas of the youth are brought to the ground, they can bring about a positive change in the country by providing an open environment to them.
My dear people, in this Mann Ki Baat, I want to tell you about the Constitution Day.
Vineetha says that the day was very important because we entered the seventeenth year of the formation of the Constitution.
Thank you very much for this idea.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to fulfil this historical task.
Imagine that within three years this magnificence has given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
Today, it is an example of Time Management and Productivity that they have built the Constitution at such a rapid pace.
It also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in the recorded time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the greatest talent in the country and all of them were committed to empowering India and empowering the poor to give the Constitution to the nation.
When 60 years of the Republic of India was completed in 2010, a bright journey was organised in Gujarat with a constitution on elephants.
It was an opportunity to create awareness among the youth about the Constitution and to connect them with different heads of the Constitution.
In 2020, we will complete 70 years as a democratic and republic, and we will complete 75 years of our independence by 2022.
Come, let us take forward our constitutional values and ensure peace and prosperity in our country.
He said that even though Indians are different backgrounds, we must be better than all.
India First India is the first Dr.
It is proposed to celebrate this occasion in all the State Governments and Union Territories.
Likewise, it will be celebrated all over the world.
In addition to this, a train will also run on the way to the holy places related to Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
I remember Lakhpat Sahib's Gurudwara while participating in this meeting last day.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, the Gurudwara had a major loss.
Our journey will continue.
Our journey will be deeper, it will be heartening to all of you.
Sometimes there's a question in somebody's mind - What did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your great wishes are my great wishes...
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, all of us.
Like every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very comfortable.
I urge you all to join the Runner Unit with enthusiasm.
Approximately six and a half months before independence, the world's most famous international publication The Time Magazine became a picture of Sardar Patel on the cover page of Lakshadweep on 27 January, 1947.
They gave a picture of India with a major article that we didn't see today.
It was a painting of India that was scattered in different parts.
There were more than 550 countries at that time.
There was no interest in the English on India.
He said how he did rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920.
It's said how Berdoli gave a direction to the Satyagraha.
Everyone from the farmers and the workers to the industrialists was capable of trusting him and his commitment to the nation.
On 31st October, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary will be highly special and on this day, Sardar Patel will be dedicated to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double of the Statue of Liberty of America .
This is the world's tallest, genuineest statue.
Every Indian can be proud of being the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the earth, will be decorated with the sky.
Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we celebrated 'Infantry Day'.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the family of the soldiers for their courage.
But you know why people of Hindustan celebrate 'Infantry Day'
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army came to the land of Kashmir and waited for Kashmir from the stairs.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has a direct connection to this historic event.
I was reading a face of Sam Manek Shah, a great military officer of India.
In the face, Field Marshal Manek Shah is remembering the time he was a field market.
At that time, in October, 1947, the military was launched in Kashmir.
31st October is the memory of our former Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
He also paid homage to Indiraraj.
My dear countrymen, who don't like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
It's not the source of any player's victory.
Two meetings were held in memory in recent times.
First of all, there is a chance to meet our Para Athletes participating in the Asian Para Games 2018 in Jakarta.
Similarly, there was a chance to see the winners of the Commerce Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
In the Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have performed well.
We won 13 medals and 3 medals in Micro Enterprises.
This is the story of Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where nobody thinks.
When he was 8, he lost his father.
He lived in the orphanage for the next 8 years.
After leaving the orphanage, DDC buses cleaned and worked as a waiter on roads in Delhi.
Today, the same Narayan International has won gold medals for India.
Not only this, see how India is attaining the heights of excellence in sports.
India has never won an Olympic Medal in Judo, Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
16-year-old young player Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a worker, she's fishing.
Sometimes this kid's family had no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation, the fort has not been embarrassed by the enthusiasm of Tababi Devi.
And that's why he won the medal for the country and created history.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is inspiring.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the threshold of New India.
Ladies and gentlemen, in 2017, we successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
As a tournament organised successfully in comparison, the entire world congratulated it.
This year, India has got the opportunity to organise Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will take place from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of all Indians, whatever game you play, whatever game you want to play, Hockey must have a choice.
India has offered hockey to great players.
Whenever there is a discussion about World Hockey, the story of Hockey will be incomplete besides these great players of India.
Hockey Mantrakin knows Major Dhyanchand all over the world.
Subsequently, Balvinder Singh Senior, Leslie Cloudis, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Kisan, Hockey has been on a long journey.
Even today, team India players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey through their successes due to their teachings and dedication.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to see thrilling games.
To go to Bhubaneswar, not only encourage the Indian team but also encourage all teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, in a new spirit, in a new zeal, in a new zeal, in a new way, these things are being done with new dreams.
Some are teaching children, some are teaching old people, some are about cleanliness, some are helping farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play velocity basketballs to help the velocity basketball team of Divyangjans.
This excitement, this dedication is a work in Mission Mode.
Can't any Indian be proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, this time, when I saw the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I found a very attractive note of Mr. Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written in MyGOV, Please tell Mann Ki Baat how the people of India and their lifestyles, traditions and traditions are an excellent example of co-operation with nature.
We need to learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our lives for sustainable development.
Manesh ji, I congratulate you for putting this issue before the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter of inspiring us to look at our glorious past and culture, particularly in the world, west states are talking about environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants, flowers and goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the tree named Almora and Arjun with respect.
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
In particular, they don't want to sacrifice their lives to protect trees, but they don't permit any damage to a tree.
The peasants of Arunachal think they have a direct connection with tigers.
They think they're like their sisters.
The people from the Warli community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and enrich tigers for them.
The Gaud Tribes of the Middle India halt fisheries in some parts of the river Kethan during fisheries.
They see these regions as the base of fish, and they get good fish because of this practice.
Toda, a small fertilizer community in the solitary regions of Nilgiri in south India, is traditionally building their homes because of the goods available in that area.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with peace and harmony, but if anybody harms their natural resources, they cannot fight to protect their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were the people of the tribal community.
Come on, let's explain their respect.
My dear people, Mann Ki Baat is talking about those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother of Punjab, Gurubachan Singh.
A common teacher was the marriage of a farmer, Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that a common farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the father of the bride that he had put forward the obligation that it was the real strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that now I have to promise that there is no fire in the field.
You can imagine how big it has social power.
It seems that Gurubachan Singh ji said this thing is immaculate, but his personality is enormous and there are many families in our society that make personal things a subject of society.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh ji was such an example before us.
I read another village in Punjab about the stone mazar near Nabha.
The people of Majra, instead of burning the window, merge it to the ground and use technology for it.
Best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to the people from all over the world for making great efforts to keep the atmosphere of Majra and stones free.
You are living as the real infinite authority of the Indian tradition, a healthy lifestyle.
Om Dhau, Peace, Peace Prithvi, Peace Prithvi, Peace Prithvi, Peace Prithvi, Peace Venus, Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace, Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace Peace be either in all the three worlds, either in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the atmosphere, in the air, in medicinal plants, in medicinal plants, in the universe, in the entire Brahmadan.
In the flora, in the heart, in you, in the corner of the world, there is peace everywhere.
The First World War was a major event for India.
In a clear way, we didn't have any direct connection with that war.
Yet our soldiers bravely fought, played a very big role, made great martyrdom.
When Indian soldiers came to war, they showed the world that nobody was behind.
In the First World War, the world was the piece of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and approximately so common people have died.
The whole world understood what is the importance of peace through this.
In the last hundred years, peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony is not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice, it is necessary to work together and collaborate with the world.
The development of the poor is the real symbol of peace.
Dear people, our North-Eastern region is different.
The natural beauty there is unparalleled and the people there are very talented.
Our North-Eastern region is now famous for many goodwill.
The North-Eastern region has progressed in the field of organic farming.
A few days ago, the Future Policy Award 2018 was received in order to encourage sustainable access to Sikkim.
Oh, i.e., the food and aggregation is given.
The award for the best policy formulation in the region is equivalent to Oscars in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim state has won the awards behind 51 policies that have been nominated by 25 countries.
It conveys its best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
Dear people, the month of October is over.
There are many changes in the weather.
Festivals are likely to be celebrated in a way like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiyaduj and Chhath, in a way, the month of November.
May this be an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode in your lives, your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
