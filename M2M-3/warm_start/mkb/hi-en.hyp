Friends, Festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our India and the Country of Festivals have immense potential for festival tourism.
Our efforts should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.

Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in promoting festival tourism in India.

My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you all will remember the date of October 31.
Sardar Patel used to closely see and examine things.
In fact, they were man of detail.
At the same time he was also skilled in organizational skills .
He was great in preparing plans and making strategies
When they read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, they know how tremendous their planning was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921 at Nineteen Twenty-ne .
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Put shoes in these bags, keep yourself with the delegates' mind ended the tension of stealing shoes.
On the other hand , the sale of khadi also increased considerably
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He worked importantly to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination on the basis of caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did a very big Bhagirath and historic work to unite the princely states.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country is discussed in some special provinces only.
He played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947 , the sight of our neighbor was on Lakshadweep and he sent the ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got information about this, he lost the time without delay, immediately, started rigorous action.
Soon after his command , the tricolor was hoisted therein , and they destroyed every neighbour ' s neighbour ' s neighbour ' s neighbour .
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the Mudaliar Brothers that they personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to the progress of India.
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you all travel to its beautiful islands and beaches
My dear countrymen, the day of October 31, 2018 was dedicated to the nation and the world on the occasion of Sardar Saheb.
This is the highest statue in the world .
The Statue of Liberty located in America is also higher than double
The highest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indian ' s head rises higher than glory .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Nity in a year.
This means that on an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of City every day.
He expressed his faith and faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are new opportunities for the local economy and people are getting new employment opportunities.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villages are providing the facility of home-step in their homes.
Professional training is also being given to those who provide Home Stay Facilities.
The people there have started cultivation of rugon routes and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states and for the Tourism Industry, this state of unity can be a subject of a study.
We all testify how a place within a year develops as a world famous tourism destination.
People from abroad come there
Transports, lodging, guides, eco-friendly arrangements, one after another, a lot of arrangements are developing on its own.
A large economy is developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Integration Day is celebrated every year on 31st October from 2014.
This day, gives us the message of protecting us, the unity, integrity and security of our country at every cost.
On 31st October, every time Run for Nity is also being organized.
It will include people of every section of society, people of every section
Run for unity is a symbol of this thing, this country is running in one direction and wants to achieve a goal.
Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat I
The last five years have been seen not only in Delhi but also in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the district centers, in small tier-two-tier-three cities, there are very large numbers of men, women, people of the city, children, youth, elderly people, disabled people and people are joining in large numbers.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting a hobby and passion about marathon.

Running is beneficial for all mind and body .
It's also running here.
We also realize the feelings of India, as well as the Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat, we are also connected to this process.
And that's why not only the body, but the mind and rites to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
And that's why you can know about the city where you live, around you.
This portal provides information about the places across the country where run for unity is to be organised.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31 for the unity of India and for ourselves.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country in the form of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a rites in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every pace, at every pace, at every pace, in a country full of diversity like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and vigilant to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, their contributions, their contributions, becomes very quick from the memorial panel.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court ruled on Ram Janmabhoomi.
Interest groups were playing games to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
To create warmth in the atmosphere, what kind of language was spoken
But all this, five days, seven days, ten days, continued, but as soon as the decision came, a pleasant and surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand, everything happened for two weeks, but when the decision on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very balanced and balanced statement.
Whenever I remember that day , the mind is happy
The dignity of the judiciary was honored very gloriously and there was no warmth, no atmosphere of tension
These things should always be remembered that it gives us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of the voice of unity, how much power it gives to the country.
I pay homage to them today
My dear countrymen, today, if a story from every household is heard far and wide, a story from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, it is the story of cleanliness.
But there ' s a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I hear, I think, I'll hear you too.
You imagine, the world's highest battleild, where the temperature goes into minus 50-60 degrees minutes
Hoygen is also the only name in the air
In such opposite circumstances, staying among such challenges, is not less than any observation
In such a distressing situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, but are also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate the people of the country for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I thank you .
There ' s so cold that it ' s hard to decompose anything
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, to remove 130 tons of waste from the glacier and its surroundings and that too is a big service between the strategic ecosystem.
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water, so the cleanliness campaign here means to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas.
as well as use water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival to awaken a new consciousness in all of us.
And in Diwali, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market happens in every family in less quantity.
I once said we try - - buy local things
We don ' t need to go to the tehsil if we meet our village .
If found in the tehsil, then there is no need to go to the district
The more we will try to buy our local things, Gandhi will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I urge you to buy something or the other from the hand of our weavers.
Even in this Diwali, you must have bought a lot before Diwali, but there are many people who think that if you go after Diwali then perhaps it will be a little cheaper.
And there will be many who will still be bought .
So, along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come and urge us to buy local things.
Look, how important can we play in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
We use diverse firecrackers in Diwali
But, sometimes there is fire in unconsciousness
Somewhere gets injury
I urge you all to handle yourself and celebrate the festival with great zeal
My best wishes.
Thank you very much
Talk of mind, September 2018
Is he able to control it on his own life and fate
You can remember that Jantar of the god Bapu
Can we imagine what I am buying will benefit my country ' s citizens
Today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy festival.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered to be a symbol of mutual love and trust of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula had linked people associated with two different states or religions with the door of faith.
Just a few days later , the festival of Janmashtami will also come .
The entire atmosphere is going to echo elephant, horse, palanquin Jai Kanhaiyalal's, the echo of Govinda-Govinda
The joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Raksha Bandhan Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in saving, riding and reaching this great heritage.
Every language has its own significance, India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are proud of the fact that Sanskrit language has also played a very big role in propagating knowledge from the Vedas to the present.
Knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, they say that the mantra to deal with the challenges of global warming is mentioned in detail in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivamoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language for talks.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
Sometimes lions use poetry but those who are familiar with Sanskrit admirers, they know that so much accurate statements are made by Sanskrit admirers in very few words and secondly, it is very easy to understand because of being connected to our land and our tradition.
Like in life, it has been asked to explain the importance of the Guru - once Aksharamstu, Guru : Sages Prabodhayat
We all celebrate the coming Teachers Day with this spirit
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day .
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day, and also congratulate your dedication to science, education and students.
Plants scorching with severe heat give relief to dry reservoirs but sometimes it also brings excessive and destructive floods
There is a situation of nature that some places have more rain than other places .
Heavy floods in Kerala have badly affected life
Today in these difficult situations the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, the loss of life cannot be compensated, but I want to assure the sad families that 1. 25 billion Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of sorrow.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity should be healthy at the earliest.
I am confident that Kerala will soon resurrect on the strength and indomitable courage of the people of the State .
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, whether it is Kerala or other districts of India and the areas, people's life can be normal again.
People associated with all age groups and every sector are contributing to their contributions.
Everyone has started ensuring that the problems of the people of Kerala can be done at least, we share their grief.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the heroes of the ongoing rescue work in Kerala
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of NREGAs .
In this moment of crisis he has done a very good job .
Efforts to handle the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions have become a centre of new faith for every Indian
Tomorrow was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam gives strength to the country and especially Kerala to recover from this disaster at the earliest and speed up the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to talk about the mind
The topic on which people from all over the country wrote, is the topic of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone drowned in mourning
A nation leader who had left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the last 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
Were not seen anywhere in the news, publicly did not see
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come in front of the country.
People recall him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister and do so.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act two years and three.
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics
Firstly, the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set to disqualify the parties.
For many years, political culture of setting up a huge cabinet in India was created not only for the division of large-scale Cabinet functions but also for the pleasure of politicians.
Atal ji changed it
Their move saved money and resources
At the same time , efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji, who changed the situation and developed healthy traditions in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
There was a change in the time of presenting the budget during his tenure .
Earlier , according to the traditions of the British , the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening because at that time there was a time to start parliament in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 am to 11 am
Many such rules have been made in this code, so that it is possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this , more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag .
So they brought near to the people our lifelong Tricolor .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that discussions are going on in the country about conducting elections of the Center and the States together.
People are talking in both sides of this subject and opposition
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I will definitely say that for healthy democracy, developing good traditions for better democracy, steadily trying to strengthen democracy, extend discussions from open mind, it will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his commitment to fulfill his rich and developed India, I pay homage to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days ago, the monsoon session of Parliament has ended.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74
All MPs, rising above the party, tried to make the monsoon session more useful and as a result, the Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills passed by the Rajya Sabha
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth.
Several important bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades there was a demand for making BOmissions like STO Communication.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of making the BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right.
This step will prove to be taking forward the objective of social justice .
Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also passed in this session.
This law will further safeguard the interests of ST and ST community
At the same time, it will prevent the oppression of criminals and trust in Dalit communities
No civil society can tolerate any injustice against women ' s power .
The country is not ready to tolerate the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made a strict punishment
The culprits of rape will be punished for at least 10 years, the same will be punished for raping girls below 12 years of age
A few days ago, you must have read in the news, a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two accused of rape to a minor after just two months of hearing.
Earlier in Katni in Madhya Pradesh a court punished the culprits after just five days of hearing .
Rajasthan has also made such quick decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing cases of crime against women and girls
Economic progress without social change is incomplete
However , this session of Rajya Sabha has not been possible . I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly for justice .
When we move forward in the country's interest, changes in the lives of poor, backward, exploited and deprived can be brought about.
In the monsoon session this time everyone has presented an ideal .
These days the attention of millions of countrymen is on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country
My best wishes to those players whose competitions are yet to remain.
Players of India, especially shooting and resting, are performing excellently but our players are also bringing medals in those games in which our performance has not been so good in the past, such as Yushu and Rowing - these are not medals - proofs - Indian sports and sportspersons touch the heavens and dreams.
Our daughters are included in the increased number of medal winners for the country and this is a very positive sign - even our 15-16-year-old young players who win the medal.
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won the medals are from small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work.
On August 29, we will celebrate the National Sports Day, I extend my greetings to all sports lovers, as well as hockey magicians, Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play and take care of their dignity because healthy India will create a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day
Namaste spirit, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen houses and buildings being built by brick-stones, but can you imagine that about twelve-two-two-two years ago a huge mountain, which was just a single-stone mountain, was given the form of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it had happened and that temple is Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra.
If someone tells you that about a thousand years ago a pillar of granite was built over 60 metres and about 80 tons of wildlife was placed on its summit - would you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mix of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
Land of India has been a laboratory of engineering
There were many engineers in India who made imaginable and presented miracles in the world of engineering.
We also got a gem in our heritage of great engineers whose work is still surprised by the people and they were Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
He is worshipped in that part of the country, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and selfishness.
In his memory , 15th September is made in the form of Engineers Day .
Following their footprints, engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world.
When I talk about the miracles of the engineering world, I remember an incident of the terrible earthquake in Kutch in the past 2001.
At that time when I used to work as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was ridiculing us on seeing me and she was saying, Look, this is my house - in Kutch she says, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But you didn ' t see any damage anywhere
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature of this place and it was saying so proudly that I came to the idea that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had constructed according to the local conditions because of which the people were safe.
Now when we celebrate the Engineer's Day, we should also think for the future
Workshops at places
What new things we have to learn in the changing age .
The world is struggling with natural calamities
In such a situation what is the new form of structural engineering
What are his courses
What to teach students
How does hero waste become our priority
We must think of many such things when the engineers celebrate the Day.
There is an atmosphere of festivals and the preparations for Diwali also start .
We will continue to gather in the matter of mind, talk of mind and we will continue to gather in furthering the country with our minds.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you
Will meet again
These days there are good rains in many places .
There is also news of concern due to excessive rains and at some places people are still waiting for rain
The vastness of India, diversity and sometimes rain also shows the form of choice and dislike, but what do we blame the rain, human beings who have chosen the path of conflict with nature and the result of that is that nature sometimes turns on us.
And that is why we all have the responsibility of becoming nature lovers, be the protector of nature, be the promoter of nature, then the balance of the nature remains on its own.
In the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind.
You must have seen all of them on TV, the team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and went to the cave to roam their coach.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that Day fate was more desirable .
When they entered into the cave , abruptly heavy rain accumulated near the gate of the cave .
You can imagine that when death appears in front of adolescence and you have to spend moments then how will that moment be
On one hand, he was struggling with crisis, on the other hand, humanity was uniting all over the world and expressing the human properties of God.
People all over the world were praying to get these children out safely
Everybody, whether it is the government or the parents of these children, their families, media or citizens of the country, everybody has shown a unique conduct of peace and patience.
All the people were engaged in their mission as a team.
In this entire operation, a naval personnel of Thailand also lost their lives.
The whole world is surprised that in spite of such difficult situations he did not leave his hope with such bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are amazing things
Just need to focus on our goals with a calm and stable mind, work for it.
In the past, the dear poet of our country Neeraj ji left us.
Neeraj ji had a specialty - hope, trust, determination, trust on himself
However, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.

Millions of youngsters like Satyam leave school and go to colleges

July is the month when the youngsters stand in the new phase of their lives when they go away from the occusations to the cut-o.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel
Students come in the shadow of professionals from the shadow of Parents
I am sure my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment, you have to become your own partner.
For the first time all such youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students have so far joined their colleges, some will be connected.
I will tell you this thing that be peace, enjoy life, enjoy the spirituality in life.
There is no choice without books, study has to be done, but the trend of finding new things should continue.
old friends have their own valuable
Childhood friends are valuable, but to choose, make and maintain new friends, it is a very wise job in itself.
Learn some new languages such as new skills, new languages.
Youngsters who have left their homes and have gone to read at some other place, know about those places there, know the people there, the language, culture, there will be tourist destinations.
My best wishes to all the youngsters who are starting new innings
His father nurtures his family by drinking waste
I congratulate them for their success .
There are many students who are from the poor family and with their hard work and passion, they have done something that inspires us all.
Ahmedabad's daughters are offensive Sheikh, whose fathers run auto rickshaws, Nagpur's daughter is happy, whose fathers are also drivers in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in bricks and bricks.
Ramesh himself used to sell toys in the fair or Anushka Panda, the Divya daughter of Gurgaon, who is suffering from a genetic disease called spinal cord atrophy from birth, all of them have achieved such success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us, we will get many such examples.
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to hear the sky of the earth, I have to call every darkness in the light, I have to head the sword with the fragrance of flowers, and to wake up the mountains of Ga-ga, my dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news, wrote - Two youths did the dream of Modi.
The incident was that once the San Jose city of America, known as Technology Cub, I was discussing with Indian youth there.
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India. Think about it and take some time.
I had appealed to change brain-rain into brain-gain
Using his professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have jointly prepared a Smart Gaon App.
These apps are not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile.
The residents of this village of Taudhakpur in Rae Bareli, Village-Prime Minister, District Magistrate, all of them made people aware of the use of this app.
If you look closely at this incident, one thing will come to mind that the young people in the United States, their livelihoods and thoughts are living in the midst of them, India must have left several years ago, but still they know the nuances of their village, understand the challenges and the emotionality of the village is connected to the village.
For this reason, he might have made something according to what the village needs.
Every Indian has a natural feeling of doing something for his village, his roots and his roots.
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to the ecosystems, there is a light ashes on it, but if a small spark is touched then all things emerge again and they draw towards their past days.
We must also check that even in our case, it has not happened, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us anywhere, the ashes have not been stored.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone all.
In reality Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhari Ekadashi, who was on 23rd July, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Approximately 15 - 20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi i . . Varkari i . . pilgrims go on foot for the journey of Pandharpur with the palanquins .
This journey, which is called Wari, includes millions of warriors
Saints like Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram walk towards Pandharpur, singing, dance, playing pedestrians, keeping in the palanquin.
Pilgrims reach there to visit Lord Vithal , which is also called Vithova or Pandurang .
God Vitthal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith, devotion.
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and its glory, beauty and spiritual joy have its own experience.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once you get the opportunity.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - Innumerable saints are still educating the people in Maharashtra
The saints have been inspiring in every corner of India to fight against superstition .
Whether it is their brother-in-law or disillusioned, we get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
Its mantra is to fight society with faith against superstition
These were those people who prevented the society from time to time, showed tokens and mirrors and ensured that the old practices are over from our society and the rites of compassion, equality and purity come in the people.
Our India-Bhoomi Bahuratna Vasundhara is like a great tradition of saints in our country, in the same way the great men dedicated to the capable mother-Bharati, dedicated their lives to the earth.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence .
They had the power and wisdom of showing the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to treason three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing
I want to keep an interesting incident related to a statue of Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad in front of the countrymen today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad today and during his journey, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with him and was extremely affected by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 1st August, 1920, he had decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose Victoria Garden for Lokmanya Tilak ' s memorial and this Victoria Garden which was in the name of the ueen of Britain .
Finally, Sardar Saheb got ready as a statue and inaugurated it with Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February, 1929, and the most funny thing is that in that inaugural function, in that speech, worshipper Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got one person but also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the specificity of this statue is that this is such a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, in which Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of public Ganesh Festival started.
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of pursuing traditional reverence and festival as well as social awareness, collectiveness, harmony and equality among people.
At the same time, it was a time when it was necessary that the country be united to fight against the British, these festivals worked to unite everyone while breaking the barriers of caste and sect.
The popularity of these events increased over time
This shows that the heroes of our ancient heritage and history still have crew in our younger generation.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like Leadership and Organization, they can develop them in their own way.
And when I remember Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh Festival this time too, celebrate Ganesh with joy and fervor but urge the eco-friendly Ganesh Festival.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the decoration of the commodities, everything is eco-friendly and I would like to have the eco-friendly Ganesha Festival in every city, they should be rewarded and I would like to keep the things of Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival on MyGov and Narendra Modi App for widespread publicity.
I will surely deliver your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen, he gave slogans that Swaraj is our birth right and we will be with us.
Today is the time to say that Swaraj is our birth right and we will take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad
What will be a young man in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines, Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, see how strong is in Baju-e-Katil, these lines inspired many youths like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad
Chandrasekhar inspired many youths for the bravery and freedom of freedom
Azad put his life on the claim, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
It was my privilege that I also got the privilege of going to Chandrashekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrashekhar Azad Park of Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage to him and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was the brave men who did not want to die from the bullets of foreigners - if they would fight for freedom and die, they would still die free.
Once again I salute two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has won the Gold Medal in the 400-meter race at the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Island.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, emailed me from Indonesia in response to my letter, now she is preparing for ASEAN Games.
-The most important moment in the life of any athlete is that when he holds the tricolor and I am proud that I have shown it.
Unity is also proud of you
You have illuminated the name of the country
Ekta won the Gold and Brone Medal in World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018 in Tunisia
Their achievement is special because they made their challenge their own way of success .
In 2003, due to the fear of daughter unity, half of her body's body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and made herself strong.
Another Divya Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won the Gold Medal in the Para Athletics Grand Prince Discus Trio in Berlin and made the world record with him, Sunder Singh Gurjar also won the Gold Medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, several events in the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes the disease also enters the house due to the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for this month of August and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries.
Once again , they will meet for a word of mind .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, this programme of Mann Ki Baat has once again been fortunate to be with you all.
Just a few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore
You must have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan ' s first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India .
In this match, both teams performed the best and one of Afghanistan's ballar Rashid Khan did this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me and wrote on his Twitter that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to show their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is the world of cricket and at the same time he wrote in a little funny manner that we are not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well , this was the first match , so remembering is very natural , but I will remember this match for some particular reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
What can a winner team do while taking trophy
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team of Afghanistan, which was playing international match for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and both teams took photos together
What is the Sportsman Sprit, what is the sportsmanship - we can experience this incident.
Sports is an unprecedented way to unite the society and find out the talent that our youth have.
My dear countrymen, on June 21, there was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world came together
Be it the European Parliament in Brazil, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese navy fighter ships, people from all over the world have seen yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic event and I have been told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
On the high snowy peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China performed yoga together
Yoga works to break, connect all boundaries
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a big festival by going beyond all varieties of castes, religions, regions, colors or genders.
If people from all over the world were taking part in Yoga Day programmes with so much enthusiasm then why would not it be multiplied in India
Our warriors of the Air Force surprised everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet from the earth in the middle sky.
The view was that they floated in the air, not sitting in the airplane
Be it school, college, office, park, high building or sports ground, yoga has been done everywhere.
Yoga has worked to unite the people of the world beyond caste, creed and geography and the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have won for centuries.
Our sage, Muni, saint, who always emphasizes, Yoga has proved him in the right way.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives .
On MyGov and Narendra ModiApp, many people have written to me that I will talk about the factors' day coming on 1st July in the matter of mind.
We are those people who voluntarily worship Mother as God, believe in God, because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, many times doctors give us reproduction.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor has medical expertise and he has a deep experience about the general life style trends and what impact he has on our health.
Indian doctors have made their identity worldwide with their capability and skills
In the medical process, our doctors are known for the great, hardworking and helping the entire medical problems.
We are fortunate people who are born in this land of India
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historical incident.
See , India has its own heritage everywhere
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has its own contribution, its own glory.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Magah on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you are well aware of the Kabiravad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also done a national session of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas ji went to Magah
At that time there was a belief that the person who died in Magah does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that leaves in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered unclean but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it .
And they broke the evil deeds of their times and the superstitions , and so they forgot , and they obeyed it .
Sant Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and two
These were their ideals
In his works we see this ideal and in today ' s era he is equally inspiring .
That is the true Pir saint who knows and understands the sufferings of others, who do not know the sufferings of others are sure
Kabirdas ji had given special emphasis on social harmony
They used to think longer than their time .
Let it put you, please all the corpses
In another double, Kabir writes - where there is Daya Tah Dharma, where Lobha Tah sin
He said: - Do not ask caste sadhu, ask knowledge
This is the greatness of the Guru and the same guru, Jagatguru guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed the way to the people, keep inspiration for centuries.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God
wherever he went , he took several initiatives for the betterment of society
The system of kitchen free from social discrimination where every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system.
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and zeal .
You must also urge the people to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji in the entire society and around the world, what are new ideas, what are new suggestions, what new imaginations, we think about it, prepare it and with great pride, make it a festival of inspiration for all of us.
My dear countrymen
The struggle for India's independence is very long, it is very wide and deep, it is full of innumerable royalties.
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019, the terrible incident of Jallianwala Bagh is also going to complete 100 years that had shamefully shaken the entire humanity
100 years of this incident are going to be completed, how can we remember it, we can all think about it, but always remember the immortal message that this incident has given, this violence and cruelty can never be solved.
victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi, has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much.
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people must know that at the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation at Kolkata University in Bengali Language
This was the first time when the British ruler was and somebody at Kolkata University addressed the Convocation in Bengali language.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first industrial minister of India and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone of Indias industrial development, prepared a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
Dr Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries and also pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
They were quite positive about the development of West Bengal
His understanding, discretion and activism is the result of a part of Bengal to be saved and it is still a part of India.
What was the most important thing for Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's integrity and unity - and for this, he had lost his life at the age of 52.
We should always remember the message of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's unity, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, be together for the progress of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
There was an opportunity to know about the changes that are coming in the lives of people beyond the files.
People told about their resolve, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements.
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me, but it was a different kind of learning efficiency and what can be the moment of satisfaction in anyone's life when people have seen the happiness on their faces during this period
When a common man used to listen to the stories of his feelings, he used to touch his heart.
In far-flung villages, daughters are providing services from pension to passports to the elderly of the villages through the Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by making her face-cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of youth of the country are running medicine centres as well as providing affordable medicines in nearby villages.
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business
Not only this, ten to fifteen people are also giving jobs
The students of Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa school are working on import topics such as waste management in the Tinkering Lab of the school at their younger age.
Do not know how many stories were there would not be any corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success.
In such an environment, when the common man (man) comes with a new hope, new emotion and incidents in his life, he is not credited to the government.
The incident of a small girl from a far-flung village also becomes an inspiration for 1.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very comfortable, very inspiring and it gives me satisfaction to work but also to work more.
Another new joy of spending life for the poorest of the poor, another new enthusiasm, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people were associated with this video bridge and you have worked to give me new strength.
I once again want to thank you all
I always feel that if we look around us then something is good somewhere.
They are the righteous .
We can also feel the aroma of goodness
One thing came to me in the past and it ' s a very unique combination
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand, our farmers associated with farming are brothers and sisters.
Together with TE Engineers, they have created a comfortable prosperity trust and they have doubled the income of the farmers, they have activated this trust.
They were connected to the farmers, made plans and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, from the production of crops to marketing, farmers have a major role in the entire sector and on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure their right to the participation of farmers in profits.
Separate Seed-Banks have been created for crops, good breed seeds for them.
Women see the functioning of this Seed-Bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with professionals, technology and engineering world have taken the path to connect with the farmers, to connect with the villages, to join the farm and the players.
Once again, the younger generation of my country will have some innovative experiments that I have to go, some people will not have to go, some people will know, some will not know anything but some people are doing some good things, all of them are greetings from my side.
The GST is going to complete one year, the dream of the people of the country, it has turned into reality today.
For this, if I want to give credit to anybody, then I will give credit to the states.
GST is an excellent example of cooperative federalism, where all the states together decided in the interest of the country and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people from different states sit there, there are separate priority states but despite all the decisions that have been taken so far in the GST Council, all these have been done unanimously.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before GST but now only one taxa is applicable in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty
In the first country, inspectorraj's complaints used to come in case of taxa many times
From return to return everything happens through online information technology
The arrival of GST has ended the check post and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but is also getting a lot of benefit in the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest Tata Reform
The success of such a big tax reform in India has been achieved because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured through the manpower.
It is generally believed that such a big reform, such a big country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to be completely stable but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the festival of honesty of the country is a result of the participation of the peoples power that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it continues to improve through its inbuilt system as per requirement.
through the point of mind , once again you ' ve got the chance to be the most rough .
You will be well reminded of the 6 women commanders of the Navy, this team was on a sea trip for the last several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - i want to talk about them
These 6 daughters of India, their team, have spent more than 250 days through the sea.
NST has returned to India on May 21 and the whole country welcomed him very warmly.
He traveled in different oceans and many oceans and set a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles
This was the first event in the world itself .
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters, to hear their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure and the dignity of Navi, for enhancing the dignity of India and especially the world that the daughters of India are not less.
Who does not know the sense of adventure
If we look at the development journey of mankind then progress has emerged in the womb of some adventure.
Development is born only in the lap of adventure.
I can do something about doing some taxes, some leaks, some etra ordinary things, some of these feelings may be less, but for ages, some people are getting inspiration.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra climbed the highest peak of the world by Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam.
These students of Ashram-School started training in August 2017, Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were troubled.
These youths were selected under the mission bravery and they have honoured the entire country by gaining victory as per the name.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur school, to these small friends and my heartfelt congratulations.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to defeat West from Nepal
Congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Verest became the pair of the first Indian father-son to climb
Not only this , only youngsters are climbing Verest
Sangeeta Bahl climbed Verest on May 19 and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old
This work is not only commendable, but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness and environment.
For years, people have been climbing the West and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I congratulate all these brave heroes, especially the daughters.
so large numbers of people from every region will come forward in its support
When I talk about India, I believe that as much as we play, the country will play.
On social media, people are sharing the video of the events and they are challenging each other.
Many times in the matter of mind, in relation to sportspersons, you have listened to me and for the last time our heroes of the Commonwealth Games were telling us through this programme- Namaskar Sir.
Image Yadav Ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that those games which were sometimes a part of the lives of every child, they are getting lesser today.
These games were particularly part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that they were known by different names at different places, like now Pitthu is known by many names.
Nobody knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dikori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There are also outdoor, indoor too.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these games .
The same game is known by different names.
I am from Gujarat, I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto.
These are played with codes or bamboo seeds or dice and with 88 square boards
This game was played in almost every state .
We used to play this game .
Which of us will be, who has not played guilt-danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game to play from villages to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa, it is called Gulibari, then in Maharashtra it is called financing
Some games have their own one season
You must have seen many children who are embarrassing, but they become very smooth while playing.
From children to grandparents and grandmothers, when they play everything then what they say or generation gaps, they also get touched.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions.
Many games make us aware about society, environment etc.
We can create a very large architecture of our traditional sports through crowd sourceing
Videos of these sports can be created in which rules of sports can be shown about sports methods.
On June 5, our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations of India.
This is a very important achievement for India and it is indicative of Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the spirit of this theme and its importance, all of us should ensure that we do not use polythene, loose grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact on our nature, on life and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day Wed-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them to your daily life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that there was dust in different areas of the country, along with strong winds and heavy rains, which is hungry.
There was also loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature, live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this every step throughout the life
When India played a key role in the Op 21 and Paris Agreement, when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, there was a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, we all think about what can we do to make our plan clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends
You remember equally on June 21, not only you, but the whole world remembers on June 21.
21 June is celebrated as International Yoga Day for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparations months ago.
These days, news is being received, preparations are going on to celebrate International Yoga Day on 21st June all over the world.
Centuries ago, it means that on practice of yoga regularly some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage that always protects us like a father .
Forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, mercy, our sister, self-confidence, our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge.
When all these qualities become companions of someone , the Yogi wins all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is 27 May the death anniversary of India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji
I salute Pandit ji
The memory of this month of May is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857, when the Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up against injustice while showing their bravery.
It is sad that we continued to call the incidents of 1857 only rebellion or soldiers rebellion for a long time .
In fact , that event was not only underestimated but it was also an attempt to push our self - respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of features.
A wonderful description of Savarkar ji has been made by our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
How accurate was the picture by Atal ji
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV, of our poor daughters of the raw colonies of Sikar in Rajasthan.
Our daughters, who were ever compelled to sell garbage and ask for home-to-house - are learning the work of sewing to cover the burden of the poor.
The daughters here, apart from yourself and your family's clothing, are wet from normal to good clothes.
They are also coordinating skill development.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today and are living their lives with respect and have become a strength for their families.
I extend my best wishes to our daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future .
They have shown that if there is a need to show and you are contemptible for it then success can be achieved between all the difficulties and this is not just a matter of Sikar. You will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighbourhood, you will come to mind how people defeat the problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, enjoy the tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are also political, social, films are also done, sportspersons and sportspersons are also on the problems of the country - this should be solved - but often these things are limited to discussions but some people who move forward towards bringing about changes from their work, their hard work and passion, make it a reality.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, has some similar story of making the dreams of others self-reliant and fulfilling them.
Tomorrow I got the opportunity to meet D. Prakash Rao
Shriman D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They make full arrangements for education, health and food to all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have ruined the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, society and the entire country.
Let ' s move forward positively
In the month of June , there is so much heat that people wait for rains and look at the sky with clouds in hope .
People will also wait for the moon a few days from now
The moon appearing means that Eid can be celebrated .
The festival of Eid after one month ' s fast during Ramadan is a symbol of the beginning of celebration .
I am sure all people will celebrate Eid with full zeal, especially children will get good Eids on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bond of goodwill in our society .
Greetings to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Once again , next month , I ' ll meet you in Mann Ki Baat
Talk of mind, April 2018
V.
And I am very happy that many people are joining it with great enthusiasm and have written to me while showing their support for this, letters have been sent to the social media, their ministers are from India stories.
Ruma Devnath writes that with Morning Walk, I feel myself happy and healthy and she further says - for my visits with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these holidays an opportunity to learn for a new experience, my dear countrymen.
When we hear that there are wars in the world in the future , everybody speaks of this , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think that water conservation should be this social responsibility
That is, it is the responsibility of those who have knowledge that they have been associated with curiosity, I don't know the Bengali language, but when I was young, I had a habit of getting up very soon, since childhood and radio starts early in eastern India, west India starts late in the morning.
At 30 o'clock, Rabindra Music started and I didn't know about the habit of Rabindra Music on radio early in the morning and when I had the habit of listening to Rabindra Music on radio, and when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, I would have given greater consciousness to you too, Rabindra Music would have affected their poems and I would have paid homage to my dear countrymen.

This time most of the letters are from children who have written about Leam

Worried about the water of animals and birds in summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have come to know about the activities being carried out across the country regarding farming and agriculture.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions about water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions are discussed in the festival season.
That is, the words of mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is true that the words of our minds change the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change
Indeed , it is He Who has power to change the weather all over the world .
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment, Saidul Laskar, sister of Kolkata, died - he decided to make a hospital so that no poor person died due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold house ornaments in his mission, collected money through donation.
In this way, after 12 years, the Bhagirath effort made by Sadul Laskar and today due to his hard work, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country.
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle-class, in every section, the belief is that yes.
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
There is a positive atmosphere of confidence filled with hopes and hopes.
This self-confidence, this positivity will realize our resolve of New India.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devilal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common life.
The feelings of Mahatma Gandhi's attachment to soil, farming and farming are reflected in this line when he had said that how to organise the Earth and to tell the soil, it is forgotten for us to dig the earth and take care of the soil.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji often stressed the need for the protection of trees, plants and plants and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for better income, better irrigation facilities for our farmers and ensuring food and milk production.
This state with less area has done a big job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have registered during 2015-16 as compared to last five years.
He has shown that when the goals are set, encouraging and resolved in the mind, it can be proved by doing so.
In the letters that I have received, I was watching that a lot of farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give the farmers the right price of crops.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the village, the local market and the global market.
The farmers will not have to go far to sell their produce - for this, 22 thousand rural haats of the country will definitely be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading with infrastructure.
That is, in a way, connectivity is being created with any market in the country from the farm.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will be inaugurated.
How do the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our resolve and how can the people of 1. 25 billion people best pay homage to Gandhiji by mixing shoulders and shoulders
You urge me to share your ideas with everyone through MyGov.

Tell us something about how the institutions are mobilising. Thanks. Thank you, you have said the right and I believe that both clean India and healthy India are supplementary to each other.
Today, the country has gone beyond conventional approach in the field of health.
While every work related to health in the country was just the responsibility of the Health Ministry, now all the departments and ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Medical Affairs, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, either the State Governments, are working together for a healthy India and emphasis is on healthcare as well as healthcare.
Preventive healthcare is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And as much as we are aware of the preventive health care, the people, the family and the society will also benefit.
The first need for life to be healthy - cleanliness .
Yoga has renewed its identity all over the world in the form of preventive health care.
Yoga guarantees both virtues and wellness.
It is the result of all of us that Yoga has become a mass movement today, has reached home.
This time International Yoga Day remains less than 100 days between 21st June .
On the last three International Yoga Days, everywhere in the country and the world, people participated with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all of them, for yoga.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made on a wide scale for healthcare accessible and affordable , affordable and affordable for common people .
Today more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being provided at a lower cost.

This is a very big job
You need help in spreading awareness to people.
To get rid of TB, we all have to make collective efforts.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar had spoken of industrialization of India.
The industry was an effective medium for them in which the poorest of the poor could be provided employment.
Today, India has emerged as a brief spot in the global economy and today, the world's largest FDI in the world.
The whole world is looking at India as B for investment innovation and development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible only in cities, due to which Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar relied on urbanization and urbanization of India.
Moving forward this vision, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Mission have been started in the country today to provide all kinds of facilities in big cities and small towns of the country, be it roads, water facilities, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance.
They did not want any soul to live in poverty forever .
At the same time , they believed that their poverty could not be removed from the distinction of the poor .
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s when only roads and railways were discussed in India, Baba Saheb Ambedkar had talked about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water power as nation-power.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different beaches of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40's period, most of the discussions were about 2nd World Car, Emerging World Car and Partition - at that time, Dr.
had laid the foundation of India ' s spirit
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Center and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism and cooperative federalism in every aspect of the government and the most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary to be born in a big or rich family, but people who are born in poor families in India can also see their dreams, try to fulfill those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor, to the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the birth anniversary of Dr.
Under this, there will be different programmes on village development, poor and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals are going to come in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaishali.
The day of Lord Mahavir ' s birth anniversary is to remember his sacrifice and penance .
The life of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire us all.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
The inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus Christ, who have always given the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to humanity as soon as the discussion comes.
In April, the festival of Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in those days, in Bihar, twins and satuvans, Bihu in Assam, then the joy and joy of Poila Vaishak in West Bengal will be shadowed.
All these festivals are somehow connected to our farming houses and food providers, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts we get in the form of produce.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all the festivals that will come to you .
Today in the beginning the talk of mind starts from a phone call itself .
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue , but we know from our daily life experiences that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, why the water becomes coloured
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India .
When we talk about science, the name of India-Ratna Sir C.V. Raman comes to us first.
One of his treasures is famous by the name of Raman Effect
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had eaten the incident of light stattering for which he was awarded Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On one hand, there is a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhat, on the other hand, Sushrut and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose was also named as Hamos Particle Boson
It was very interesting to know about the miracles being done in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart from cell learning
Can you help the farmers on the yield of crops
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to go to Gujarat to inaugurate the I Retreat in Ahmedabad.
Science and technology are value neutral
They don't have values, themselves
Any machine will do the same as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to work from the machine
Thomas Alva Dison inventing high bulb failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, he replied that I have discovered ten thousand ways of not creating a high bulb, that is, Dison also made his failures his strength.
Unfortunately , today I am in the workplace of Maharshi Arabindo in Auroville .
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Answer discovered and guided humanity
Repeated questions to know the truth, is important
This is the real inspiration behind scientific diet
Till then you should not sit quietly until you get answers to questions like what and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate all our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of crisis, safety and discipline keep coming to me many times on all these topics, people keep writing something or the other.
Shriman Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on working safety in his conference on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that security standards are not as good as the factories and constructions in our country.
On March 4, India's National Safety Day, the Prime Minister will talk about the safety of his mind in the program so that people get awareness about security.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, we are not able to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read the boards written on the paths many times, it states that vigilance has come down, a mistake, loss, sneezing joy and smile - do not leave the world so quickly, do not connect with security - do not do any fun, otherwise the words will be cheaper than that. There is no use in our lives.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules then we can protect our lives, but we can save the society from very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of sources are written on the workplace but when we see that it does not seem to be followed anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of geographical and climate diversity.
This country has faced many regional and man-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents.
A initiative called Disaster Mitra has also been taken to train volunteers in floods, cyclone threats.
Training and awareness plays a very important role
Twenty-three years ago, thousands of people used to lose their lives every year from the Love Wave.
After this, NMA organised workshops for management of heatwave, campaigned to create awareness among the people
Everyone ' s participation led to a good result
The number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 decreased unexpectedly to nearly 220
This shows that if we prefer security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate all those people who are working in such a way, be it social organisations or be aware citizens who are engaged in relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk condition society
In our culture, we often talk about the safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our lives
I mean , what was the arrangement of giving information
Why
Because we are not naturally conscious and therefore we listen to our ears and airplanes after sitting but none of us think that this information is for me.
That ' s how we have experience in every field of life
We do not think that security is for someone else, if we all become aware of our security then the spirit of security of the society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time, in the budget, emphasis was on making waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas for villages under Swachh Bharat.
The initiative was initiated and it was named GBAR-Han-Galvaniing Organizational Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this GBAR-HAN scheme is to make villages clean and convert the solid waste curtains of cattle dung and farms into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate money and energy.
Some European countries and China use cattle dung and other biological wastes to generate energy , but its full potential was not being used in India .
We are moving forward in this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural
The goal of using cattle dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all of them to make biogas based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as waste but also as source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will help rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in terms of energy for cooking and lining
Farmers and Animal Husbandry to enhance income
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for the smooth system of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating cooperative societies.
I invite you to become participants of this movement of clean energy and green jobs and take initiatives to transform waste into wealth in your village and to make dung from dung to dung.
My dear countrymen, till now we have been listening to how many types of festivals we have heard about Music Festival, Food Festival and Film Festival.
But the state's first waste festival was organized while making a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the creativity of the city waste and to create awareness about various methods of reuse of garbags.
During this festival, there was a variety of activities in which everybody from the students to the elders joined.
Different types of artworks were created using waste
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of East Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts.
Everybody took initiatives on their behalf and shared innovative ideas, discussions and poems were reading about cleanliness.
A festival-like atmosphere has been prepared for cleanliness
Especially the way schoolchildren participated, it was amazing
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration of the state for the innovative way in which the importance of waste management and cleanliness was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on March 8
There are many programs in the country and the world
On this day, Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country also felicitates women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
On this occasion I remember Swami Vivekananda ' s promise .
He had said that this idea of Swami ji indicates the thinking of women's power in Indian culture a hundred and a half years ago.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the equality of women in every field of social and economic life, it is our responsibility.
We are part of that tradition, where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-Pur, this was the identity of a son.
They have not only advanced themselves but have also worked to pursue the country and society and take it to a new stage.
In the past, a great suggestion was given to me.
He had suggested that on 8th March, there are programmes like celebrating Women's Day. Is every village-urban who have completed 100 years
Can a program of honor of such mothers and sisters be organised and can there be talk of a long life in it
Under the campaign launched from 26th January, 2018, these women have created a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big is the event
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the rites of cleanliness into the nature of the people in normal life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that Elephanta Island has reached electricity after 70 years of independence and how happy and excited the people there are about it.
You all know, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai
I was surprised to know that despite being with Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephant for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island, Rajbandar, Morbandar and Saintbandar, the dark shadow in the lives of the people there is now dark and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be illuminated with electricity .
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of the era of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and joy more than the illumination of the lives of the people of the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, now we have celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the adornment of the fields decorated with hungry crops, the golden girls of the wheat and the mangroves of the mango that thrills the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
But this month is very fond of all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
The importance of Holi is as important as the Holika combustion , because this day is the day of burning evils into the fire .
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the minds and feelings together, to become participants in each other's joy and gives message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen for the festival of Holi.
This festival is full of colorful joys in the lives of our countrymen .
My dear countrymen, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter on the Narendra ModiApp and have urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, on February 1, Kalpana Chawla, who goes to space, is the death date.
He left us in the Columbia Interview Accident but inspired millions of youth around the world
I am grateful to brother Prakash ji for his farewell to Kalpana Chawla in his long letter.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially in India, that there is no limit for women power.
There is nothing impossible if there is a desire and determination to do something.
It is very happy to see that today women in India are moving rapidly in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contributions have been wondering the whole world.
There is a long tradition of Indian enemies
Many of India's demonstrators have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, friends do not know how many names are
It reflects the importance of women in our society
And then, in our society, the woman has been given the status of power.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family, the formula of unity.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi has given many examples further
He has written that our adventure defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30 will give him inspiration
Three brave women have become emotional, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Higher Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30.
All Women Rue, led by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to America's San Ransisco and back to Delhi.
India flew in Boeing Jet - and all women
Honble President of India has taken a new initiative in the past
President of India calls on a group of extraordinary women who did something in their respective fields first.
These women acquaintances, first emergencies of the country, first emerging emergencies, first lady train driver, first lady fire driver, first lady bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Antarctica, thus, first drives in every area - our lady-skills have achieved extraordinary achievements while breaking the orthodoxy of society.
He showed that a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, passion and determination.
A book on these women Achieveers, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the entire country can get inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their work.
This is also available on Narendra Modi website as e-book.
Today, the country's women-power plays an important role in positive changes in the country and society.
Today , when we are discussing women empowerment , I would like to mention a railway station
A railway station and women empowerment, you might be wondering what is connectivity in the meantime.
Matunga station of Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are
Women States in all the departments - whether it is emerging as an emergency, whether it is railway policy, ticket hacking, announcing, point personality or more than 40 women's status.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on the second social media that there was a key point of the parade, BS Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
The adventurous experiments and these scenes were also surprising the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women-power is leading.
Being self-reliant
When tribal women recall, a definite picture emerges in the minds of all, in which there are forests, footpaths, the burden of wood on them is raised on the head.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power has created a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women in such dangerous areas are becoming self-reliant by running Rickshaw
In a very short period many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave what is external, accept the improvement of what is necessary
Any life-style is recognized by his cell organizing mechanism.
Our country has been constantly striving individually and socially against social misdeeds and misdeeds for centuries .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers has been made uman Hain.
Through this campaign, people were aware of evils like child marriage and dowry practice
The whole state resolved to fight with misdeeds like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, zeal and enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, the human chain went unbrokenly connected to the borders of the state.
It is important for all the people of the society to get the benefits of development in the right way that our society is free from these evils.
Let us all take a pledge to eradicate such evils from society and a New India.
India, build a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the State, the administration and every person involved in the human chain that they have taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines was 6 thousand rupees per month on his father's charge.
He was not aware of the earlier Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But now when he got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and he bought medicines from there, his cost of medicines decreased to 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire to talk about it in a programme of mind so that more and more people get this information and they can take advantage of it .
For the past few days, many people used to write me about this, tell me
Gets a deep satisfaction
And I was also very happy that Shriman Darshan ji had come to know that whatever he had received, he also met others.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health affordable and encourage ease of living
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi centres are cheaper than 50 to 90 Branded Medicines sold in the market.
This helps the people, especially senior citizens who take medicines every day, and saves a lot.
Generic medicines purchased in this are according to the fixed standards of the World Health Organization .
That ' s why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing affordable medicines but also creating new employment opportunities for the industrial entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only objective behind this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the country to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra made a photograph on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He was such a photo that my attention was drawn to that photo
The photo was such that a grandson was participating in the Lean Morna River Cleaning Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morana river flowed for twelve months but now it has become a seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, watershed
A lot of waste was being thrown on the river and its banks .
A action plan was prepared and on January 13, a day before Makar Sankranti, two coasts of Morana river were cleaned at fourteen places in the area of fourteen km under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGs, colleges, students, children, elderly and mothers and sisters of Akola participated in this good work of Mission Lean Morna.
On January 20, 2018, the Swachhta Abhiyan was continued in the same way and I have been told that unless the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a soul decides to do anything , it is not possible .
Maximum changes can be brought through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the city and the people engaged in making this work a mass movement and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma awards these days.
Even in newspapers, attention is attracted to this on T. .
Every year there is a tradition of giving Padma awards but its entire process has changed in the last three years.
Any citizen can nominate anyone now
Transparency has come after the whole process is online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become complete transformation.
Padam Awards have been given to such people who are usually not seen in big cities, newspapers, TV, functions.
Now the significance of his work is increasing, not the identity of the person to give awards.
You must have heard Shriman Arvind Gupta ji, you will be happy to know that I am very happy.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life making toys for children.
They have been making toys from waste for four decades so that children can increase the curiosity of science
They are trying to motivate children to scientific experiments with useless things, for this they are going to three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication
Sitary Jodhati (SI) of Karnataka, a similar story
They have not been called the goddess of women-empowerment.
For the last three decades , they have contributed greatly to changing the lives of innumerable women in BAGAI .
He had dedicated himself to Devdasi at the age of seven , but then he spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdas .
Not only this, they have also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for life , but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but all over the world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who illuminated the name of India abroad, was recognized and awarded Padmashree Awards.
You will be surprised to hear the story of tribal woman Laxmikutty of Kerala
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in tribal areas between dense forests
He made five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory
They have mastery in making medicines used after snake bites .
Lakshmi ji is constantly serving society with her knowledge of herbal medicines
He was honored with Padmashree for his contribution to the society by identifying this infamous person .
I would like to mention another name today that the 75 - year - old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also selected for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in other houses to make hospitals
When he was 23 years old , his husband had died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to become a hospital for the poor .
Thousands of poor are treated free of cost in their hard work hospital today
I am confident that there are many such males and males in our multi-arth-Vasundhara, there are many males and males whom no one knows or no one recognizes.
Don't identify such persons, it also causes loss of society, Padma Awards are a medium but I will also tell the people of the country that there are people living around us, consumers for the society, those who have been working with some specialty and sometimes they should be brought into the middle of the society.
They do not work for dignity but because of their work we get inspiration.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should call and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in society too.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.
This is January 9, when the goddess Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate incomplete bonds between India and the Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a programme where all MPs and mayors from across the globe were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Jiji, Tannia, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, and many other countries where our Mayors are original-Indian, where MPs are original-Indian.
I am glad that people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries and they have also maintained their strong ties with India, this time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in different areas by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
If someone is working in TO, then someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, someone brings the mind of the society with his music and someone with his poems.
Somebody is doing research on climate change and somebody is working on Indian texts and somebody has set up a gurudwara by running a truck and someone has built a mosque.
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, to recognise the people of Indian origin and to give information to the people around the world through them.
On January 30, Bapu's death anniversary, who has shown us a new path.
On that day , on that Day , we pay homage to the great martyrs who lost their lives in the defence of the country .
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or the ideals that Bapu lives with the ideals that he has told us, they are still very relevant.
They weren't just core principles
At present, we look at the dog-dug, how correct was Bapu's words
If we resolve to walk on the path of Bapu, let's go, then what can be a great tribute to him
My dear countrymen, while conveying my best wishes to you all for 2018, I rest my speech.
Wherever they are 18 to 25 years of age, they should sit together and churn on New India, find ways and plans
How will we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters dreamed
B.
A.
I used to talk to them, I was not the name of disappointment, there was enthusiasm, there was energy, dreams, I had inspiration from those daughters, and these are the strengths of the country. These are the future of my countrymen, my dear countrymen, not only of our country but whenever the famous religious places of the world are discussed, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, in this world famous temple, millions of devotees come here to take the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami every year.
And especially in the place where it is located between the hills and the forests, how can this problem be converted into rites, how can the way to overcome the problem and what is so powerful in public participation This Sabarimala Temple is in itself an example of P.
Who will have made such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who doesn't respect them.
They are very big than all of us at the age, and they are witnesses of different stages of the country.
He's going to be 90 years old on September 28
Before going abroad, I got the opportunity to talk to Didi on the phone.
This conversation was the same, like, in very dull, younger brother, speaks to his elder sister
Modi ji: Lata Didi, salute
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: Before I was thought, Helta ji: Yes, Hamodi ji: I wish you a lot of best wishes on birthday, forward congratulations
Lata ji: There are many people bigger than age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Lata ji: I think my parents are blessings, and the blessings of those who listen.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is for all of us, this is a great education for all of us, it is an inspiration for us that despite all this, you have always given priority to the rituals and humility of your parents.
Lata ji: ji
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you: G Modi ji: You fed me some Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you do not know yourself
I know that your arrival is changing the picture of India and that is what I am very happy.
Looks very good
Modi ji: Just keep your blessings and your blessings on the whole country, and people like us continue to do something good, you have always inspired me.
Your letter also keeps getting me and I also get some of your gifts and gifts, then I have a special pleasure of this kind of adoption, which is a family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you much trouble, because, I'm watching, I know how busy you are and how much work you do.
What do you have to think
When you came to touch your mother's feet, I also sent someone to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And he blessed me on telephone, so I liked, Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love.
And once again I extend my best wishes to you on the birth anniversary.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, he wanted to come to Rubru ji: Yes, yes.
Lata ji: Yes, necessity, necessity
This will be my good fortune .
Modi ji: Salute, Didi
Lata ji: Salute
Modi ji: Best wishes to you: very much salute
Modi ji: Pramanam ji
For several weeks, all over the country, the festivals will be joyous.
All the best wishes to all of you, for the coming festivals.
In the festivals, all the family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings are not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, a inspiration.
Think, on one hand, some houses glitter with light, on the other hand, in front of him, in the houses of some people around, there is dark shadow.
In some houses, sweets are getting spoiled, so in some houses, children crawl sweets.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this dark sixth, this darkness is less - the light spreads.
We share happiness there, where there is lack, and this is our nature too.
In our houses, sweets, clothing, gits, whenever there is a delivery in, then also think about a moment.
At least in our houses, which are in excess, which we don't work now, we must make such things available.
In many cities, many NGs start-ups of young colleagues do this work.
They collect everything from the houses of the people, clothing, sweets, food, and find out the needy and reach them and do anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate the darkness under this mark
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness, your face will be brighter and brighter, your Diwali will be brighter.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi, because daughter brings good fortune and prosperity.
Can we do the program of honoring this Lakshmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters, many daughters around us, who will be working extraordinaryly.
Somebody will be working for the education of poor children, somebody will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, somebody will be serving society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
Being a lawyer, try to get justice to anyone
Our society, identify, respect such daughters, and honour them,
Program of their honor, be all over the country
One more thing can be done that, about the achievements of these daughters, make more and more shares in social media and use ashtag.
Like we all had launched a great campaign, SAILI with DAUGHTER and it spread all over the world.
In the same way, this time, we will run the campaign, India's Lakshmi
Encouraging India's Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said before that Mann Ki Baat is a big advantage that I get the opportunity to interact directly with many unknown people.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal has sent me a big entertainment letter.
And it says, I read the letter in front of you. Honourable Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang.
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when the result of my eam came, some people asked me, did you read the book 'Am Arriors'
I told you, I haven't read this book.
But, back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times.
After that my experience was quite good .
I thought, if I had read this book before Leam, I would have had a lot of benefit.
I liked a lot of aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing a letter
Ham Arriors to read 2-3 times, thank you
What you have said that if I can get out at the time of a new revision then I will definitely try to write something for Parents and Teachers.
I urge all the students and teachers of the country to tell me your experiences and suggestions about the aspects related to stress free frame.
I ' m going to study him
I will think about it and I will try to write it in my own words and in my own way, and maybe if your suggestions come more then the matter of my new revision will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas .
I once again express my gratitude to the student Alina Tayang, our friend from Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through television through newspapers and also discuss the busyness.
But, you know, I'm also a common man like you
If there was someone else on this occasion, he would have been sad and disappointed, but, he did not turn his face, but he smiled on the faces of everyone with his words
In their humility, simplicity and true sense, everybody got convinced that the form of sportsman sport was seen in the late and spirit.
The audience there welcomed their words hotly .
Even after losing in a tough collision, he praised his rival Nadal and gave evidence of winning the Sportsman Spirit.
However, on the other hand, Champion Nadal also lauded Haniel's game.
The zeal of the loser and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing in the same match .
The thought of our forefathers is indeed worthy .
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janyati Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when the qualification and humility in a person is simultaneously included, then he can not win whose heart can not win
Actually, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about is directly for your good.
It is very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we first wake up and stop him, a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I think, today, especially with my youth, I will definitely talk to you.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful to health and it becomes very difficult to leave his addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
Everybody says this
The intoxication from tobacco is due to nicotine present in it .
By its consumption in adolescence the development of brain also affects .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new topic
You will be aware that recently, e-cigarette has been banned in India.
E-cigarette is a type of electronic device different from normal cigarette.
While we understand the dangers of normal cigarettes, there is a misunderstanding about e-cigarette.
This error has been spread that there is no threat from e-cigarette
They smoke, that doesn't make any member of the family smoke, don't smoke
They know that smoking, tobacco causes huge losses to the body
He knows and the beholder knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different.
People do not have so much information about e-cigarettes.
They are completely unaware of its threat and that is why sometimes e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
Our youth goes on the path of waste unknowingly.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which have a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it's smelling.
In such a situation, many teenage and youth are seen roaming around in their offices, in their pockets and sometimes in their hands, and they become victims of this.
Young generation is the future of the country
E-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Children's life should not be ruined by the dreams of every family
These diseases, these habits do not root in society
I urge all of you to leave the drunkenness of tobacco and do not follow any misunderstanding regarding e-cigarette.
Let us all build a healthy India
You're fit I
Do you remember India
India means a bit here that if we go to the gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening, then it will happen.
This is our Bharat Mata, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara
Many human gems have come out of this earth
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the land of action.
And these are those people who have spent themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Likewise, a great security is being honored in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13
The work done by Sister Marium Thresia for the betterment of humanity in his lifetime of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
From social service and education, he had a wonderful attachment.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and remained in this mission for life.
Once again, I pay homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride not only for India but for the whole world, that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, at the same time, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single-see plastic.
In the direction of environment protection, seeing the kind of lead India has taken in the world, today the eyes of all the countries are towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be going to be part of the campaign to liberate from Single See Plastic on October 2.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own ways .
But, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
So, I tried to understand this new experiment by talking to them on the phone.
Perhaps, these things have been used for other people of the country.
Mr. Riputman Belvi ji is doing a unique effort they are plogging
For the first time when I heard the word plogging , it was also new to me
In foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantity .
But, in India, Riputman Belvi ji has propagated it very much.
Let ' s talk to them .
I congratulate you very much and the Ministry of Sports also on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pooja Bapu.
These programmes are going to be organized across the country on 2nd October, 2019.
How should this programme be done, what happens in the programme, we have heard of the experience of reproduction.
This will not only take care of our health , but will also protect the health of the earth .
With this campaign, awareness is increasing about cleanliness as well as hygiene.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take a step in this direction, then their India will move 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Riputman ji, once again, thank you very much.
And congratulations to you, your team and for this new imagination, on my behalf.
They want to move forward to transform their lives into patriotic
One thing I want to remember in advance .
Well, I will surely tell him in detail in the matter of the next mind, but today I am saying in a slight advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, October 31, is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So you start preparing right now
I will definitely talk in detail but it's time, some people can also start practices and some schemes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember, on August 15, I had told the Red Fort that by 2022, you will go to 15 places in India.
If at least 15 places and they can be done then make a night, two night stay program.
You see, understand, experience Hindustan
How many varieties we have
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on vacations, people go and therefore I would urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
Today, our rank is forty and five years ago, our rank was at number 65 i. e.
If we try more then we will make our place in the world's major places in tourism as we come to 75 years of independence.
It is also important to see that in the days of Diwali, firecrackers etc.
Whatever objection should be taken for this, you must be afflicted
Come on
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat , November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they must have worked to form a Constitution of their country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal region, where there was an important role in the sea, several arts related to Shivaji Maharaj, such as Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either located on the coastal coasts. The responsibility of the security of these arts was to serve the Maratha navy.
It is also feared by thinking that there will be no soil, neither trees and plants will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organisms be possible
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific methods that the use of urea has caused serious damage to the earth and mother, the farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the earth and mother sick
The demand of time is that our farmers, the sons of our land and the children of our land can resolve that how much urea they use in their fields today, 2022, when 75 years of independence, half of the use will stop
The person of North India will not know what is in South India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
When we see Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, in his words, once comes that when he visited India, he got a new inspiration to see India and to die for him, all these great men traveled to India in a wide range of ways and tried to understand India at the beginning of their work. Did we try to live in our country, in different states, in our country, in their own ways, in their traditions, in their traditions, in their traditions, in their diet, in the form of a student
Can you keep hash tag on Incredible India
You see, if all the people of one state will tell this then I will say in the government that they should scrutinize it and prepare publicity on which seven things have come from every state i. e.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India , it is natural for the country to worry .
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi. It is the country of Sardar Patel, who has given life to the unity of the country.
For centuries our ancestors have accepted public life and values, non-violence and harmony.
Non-violence Parmo Dharma: These have come to hear from childhood, say
I want to assure the countrymen, those who take laws, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate or tolerate any government.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and this diversity is not limited to food, living and wearing.
We have diversity in every behavior of life .
Even our festivals are filled with diversity and due to our cultural heritage thousands of years old, see cultural traditions, see social traditions and historical events, it would hardly have survived in 365 days while we have no connection with any festival.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals run according to the journal at the time of nature.
There is direct relation with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to fishermen.
Today I ' m talking about the festivals . First of all , I would like to call you a sweet pocket .
Sanvatsari festival was celebrated tomorrow in Jain society
In Jain society , Parushan festival is celebrated in Bhadra month .
The last day of the festival of Paris is on the day of the sanctuary .
It ' s really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it is also called forgiveness festival and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michami Dukkadam .
Anyway , in our scriptures , forgiveness is the Bhushan of Veerasya Bhushanam i . e . forgiveness of Veeras .
Forgiveness is brave .
We have been listening to this discussion and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the characteristic of a powerful person.
Shakespeare, while describing the significance of forgiveness in his drama The Merchant of Enece, wrote, "Mercy is double blest, if it blends him that gives him and that sentences that means forgiveness and those who were forgiven, both get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, these days, every corner of India has been furious of Ganesh Chaturthi and when the matter of Ganesh Chaturthi comes, it is natural for the public-Ganeshotsav.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before the last 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement .
And after independence, he has become a symbol of socio-education and social-consciousness.
Ganesh Chaturthi festival lasts for 10 days .
This festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for the Ganeshotsav
Festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala right now
One of the colorful festivals of India , Onam is a major festival of Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in society and creates a new emotion, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the reason for the attraction of tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or the Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction, think
A few days later, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country in the series of these festivals.
My best wishes to all the countrymen, Id-ul-uha.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us, we have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and sanitation are integrated in family life
The preparation of the festival means cleanliness
It ' s not a new thing for us , but it ' s important to make it a social habit .
Cleanliness should not only be in the house but also in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, cleanliness should be an incomplete part of these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new perameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how much you are, it is going to be able to know all these things.
Eco-friendly, environment-friendly behaviour is against him in your activities.
In the society , if against it , it is evil today .
And the result of that is that today I am seeing that in this Ganesha Festival, eco-friendly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has been created.
If you go to Tube, you will see that children are making Ganesh ji in every house and making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various types of uses are being done in every family
See how big a change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is also full of millions of bright minds.
Three years ago when the cleanliness campaign was started, it will be three years on 2nd October.
And, its positive consequences are visible
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves Open Defecation Free
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
A lot of people lost their lives , but when the water was reduced after the flood , so much was wasted everywhere .
At such a time, the workers of Jamiat Ulemahind, in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat, cleaned the phased manner of 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques.
The sweat of yourself, everybody left.
The best example of unity for sanitation, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemayahind gave.
Where can our country reach if it becomes a permanent nature of dedication for cleanliness
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you to once again launch a campaign of Swachhta Hi Seva, this Lord Seva, Swachhta Hi Seva 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Make an atmosphere for cleanliness across the country
Wherever we get the opportunity, we find the opportunity.
But all of us join
Make it a preparation for Diwali in a way, consider it as a preparation for Navaratri, accept the preparation of Durga Puja
My friends from social media can run some creative campaigns and work on the surface of the virtual world can inspire him.
Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition, this campaign by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is a competition of essay, a competition to make small films, a painting competition is being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no limit of age, there is no age limit.
You can make short films, make your mobile
Can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness
It can be in any stage, it can also be a sylent.
You see, how will it be shining on October 2 on Gandhi Jayanti
You can imagine that after this 15-day sanitation campaign, after Swachhta Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, it will be a sacred pleasure within us to pay homage to the god Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept the loan of all of you especially today.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, not because I want to express my gratitude to you for such a long time because millions of people from every corner of the country join this programme of mind.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people write to me sometimes, sometimes messages, sometimes there is a message on the phone, I have a very big treasure.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than what you wait for .
I ' m greedy because I get to learn something from all your points .
You might also think yeah, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we do not feel that we are miserable .
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Poona
I want to tell you about my friend
She always tries to help people , but I ' m surprised to see a habit .
I went to mall shopping with him once
On a sari, he spent two thousand rupees very comfortably and Rs. 450 on Peace, while the auto taken to the mall kept on molesting for five rupees for a long time.
While returning purchased vegetables on the way and saved 4-5 rupees by turning back on every vegetable .
I feel very bad
You must tell about your mind about this .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you might have been surprised, surprising and may have decided not to make such a mistake beforehand.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, a ferryer comes, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes we have a connection with the auto-rickshaw person, whenever we have a connection with a hard worker, we start cheating with him, we start cheating. Not only this, reduce two rupees, reduce five rupees.
And if we go to a big restaurant then we don't see what we have written in the bill, we don't pay the money.
Not only this, go to shopping saris in showrooms, they don't have any foolishness but they don't live without any foolishness.
What will happen to the poor mind, have you ever thought of it
There is no difference in your life of two rupees five rupees but how deep will this small habit of yours make his mind pushed
Ma'am, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling a phone that touches so much heart.
I am sure my countrymen will have a habit of behaving with the poor .
My dear young friends, on August 29, the entire country celebrates as National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey was unparalleled
I am reminding you that I want the new generation of our country to join the game.
Sports became part of our lives
If we are young nations in the world , we should also see this young game .
Sports i. e. physical information, mental alertness, personality development, I understand what more is needed.
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart mixture .
The younger generation of our country came forward in the sports world and today in the era of computer, I would also like to caution that playing is more important than play-state.
Play a game but even in the outskirts and sometimes work with hootball .
You must play cricket on the computer but playing cricket below the sky in the open ground is something else
There was a time when the family kids used to go out , the mother used to ask before when you would come back .
Today the condition is that when the children come home, they either get to see a cartoon film in a corner and then they get stuck to the mobile game and then the mother has to shout and say when you will go out.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youth that India is going to organise 17 World Cups in India from 6 to 28 October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from the world, with the festival of sports, enjoy sports, create an atmosphere in the country.
When I'm talking about the game today, I want to share with the people of the country that happened last week to be a very touching event.
I got a chance to meet some daughters of very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Ever spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes spend 30-30 days in water
Our six daughters and this is the first event in the world with courage between the waves of the sea.
Who will be a Hindustani who does not deny our daughters
I salute the tongue of these daughters and I have asked them to share their experiences with the whole country .
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it in a way because this is a brave story, a story of self-confidence and I will be happy to bring these daughters to you.
My daughters have a lot of good wishes and blessings.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September, we all celebrate Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow to him, the great scientist, Albert Einstein, said.
It is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to Awake Enjoyment in Creative Excellence and Knowledge.
This time when we celebrate Teacher ' s Day , can we all resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make a collective effort, we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come on, learn to transform this mantra.
Salute Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai city and work for the India Research Centre of World University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Vincial Inclusion, this has been a matter of discussion not only in India but in the entire world about the pundits of the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, the campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind.
This Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be held on August 28 for three years
30 crore new families have been linked to it, bank accounts have been opened.
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I am a big solution that within three years, my poor brothers sitting on the last end of the society, have become part of the mainstream of the country's economy, their habits have changed, they have started going to the bank, they have started saving money, they are feeling safeguards of money.
Sometimes the money lives in the hand, lives in the wrath, if you are in the house then you feel like spending.
If any good work is to be done in the coming days then money will be used
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, nearly 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in our banks by our poor.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor. This is his ability in the coming days.
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, whose account was opened, he also got the benefit of insurance.
Today, the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, the Rs.
In many households, due to a wage of one rupee, when there was a crisis on the poor man, the life of the family chief ended, he got Rs 2 lakh in a few days.
Be it Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Dalit, Tribal, Women, educated and educated youngsters, be it youngsters who want to do something standing on their feet, crores of millions of youth get no guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, and they stand on their own footsteps. Not only this, everybody has successfully tried to provide employment to one and half or two.
Today, there is no such time but I will surely tell the people of the bank that they upload it on MyGov.
I will try my best to reach you and there is an inspirational event that people of Media can take full advantage of it .
They can also inspire a new generation by interviewing such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very luxurious period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature are enthusiastic on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vicious form, then it is known that there is also a great power to destroy water.
Nature gives us life, it leads us, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its terrible form and its destruction.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are also getting a big negative impact.
For the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to high rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being monitored.
Relief work is being done at a comprehensive level.
My colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching wherever possible.
State governments are also making all efforts to help flood victims in their own ways.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens working with service, are also making all efforts to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, the soldiers of the Army, the people of the Air Force, the people of NCR, the traditional forces, everybody is involved in serving disaster victims at such a time.
And 247 control from helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the situation of floods.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government system was prepared by drilling mocks at maximum places before you.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually, we also made the nature that according to the weather forecast, we can also create our activities, then we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for the matter of mind, I see that citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been such letters about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the speech of your shared accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) started on the date of last month in our country.
Can you tell us whether the results are coming after a month as the government had effected
I would like to hear your ideas about it, thank you.
The implementation of GST has been almost a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very happy, when someone writes to me a letter and says that how the prices of the need of the poor have been reduced due to GST, how the things are cheap.
If a person living in the forests in the North-East, far-flung mountains writes a letter that initially he was afraid that what is it but now when I started learning in it, I feel that it has become easier than ever before.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is, customers have started increasing trust in the businessman.
Now I was watching how GST had an impact on the transport and logistics sector.
How has the movement of trucks increased now
How is the time decreasing the distance
Highways clutters have been free.
Pollution has also decreased due to the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This is not only the facility, but also the economic speed gets strength from this.
Earlier, due to being a separate tax structure, the transport and logistics sector used to maintain the maximum resources of the sector and it had to make new versions within every state.
GST which I call Good and Simple Ta has actually produced a very positive impact on our economy in a very short span of time.
The rapid pace of smooth transmission and the pace of migration, new registrations have created a new confidence across the country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of management, the pundits of technology, will definitely write the use of GST in front of the world as a model.
There will be a case student for many universities in the world.
Because it is a huge height of success in such a large country with such a big change and development of millions of people.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it and all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center unanimously.
And the result was that every government had the same priority that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the stakeholders of the central and state government.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a transformation, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
In a way, there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I salute the countrymen for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
We have easily heard this thing since childhood and this is the reason that the Non-cooperation Movement began on August 1, 1920.
The uit India Movement began on 9th August, 1942, known as the August Revolution and on 15th August, 1947, the country became free.
In a way, in the month of August, many incidents are particularly associated with the date of independence.
But very few people know that this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali to quit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country continue to join with the freedom fighters, continue to bear and bear the pages of history are our inspiration for building a grand India.
Our freedom fighters have given sacrifices, penance and sacrifices, what can be greater inspiration than that.
uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian Freedom Movement.
This movement had resolved the entire country to liberate from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian people had become part of the uit India Movement in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, in villages, in cities, inspired, inspired, poor and rich.
People's anger was on its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were fighting their lives with the mantra of death.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, left the books.
The Non-cooperation Movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 shows two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The colors of the non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra to do or die.
Behind all these successes there was public support, public power, public resolve, public conflict.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we look at the pages of history, then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which began from 1857, continued every moment in any corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the people of the country.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
The generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
The country has been trying every moment to overthrow the British ruling elite.
From 1857 to 1942, this movement created a situation that reached its peak in 1942 and quit India was a buzz that the British had to go in 1947 within 5 years.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the people of Lakshadweep.
And from 1942 to 1947, five years became such a peoples mind, with the resolve, it became the cause of giving freedom to the country with success as a five decisive year of success.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to connect you with this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
Governments came-which
Arrangements have been made, changed, developed, increased.
Everyone tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes were also found.
The expectations also live.
Like 1942 to 1947, there were a decisive five years of prosperity.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year-old section of the resolution has come to us.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrated as a resolution festival and when 75 years of independence will be held in 2022, we will continue to transform that resolution into achieving.
There are millions of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
Like 1942 to 1947, five years have become decisive for the country's independence, they can become decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then we all have to take a strong resolution today.
2017 is to make the year of our resolution.
This is the month of August that we have to join with the resolution and we have to resolve.
Let's run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from 9th August in this month.
A resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can highlight new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
The video, post, blogs, graphs and new ideas used to bring all these things.
Transform this campaign into a mass movement.
This is an attempt to connect youngsters with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe you must propagate it, propagate it.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the principal servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I'm just a minute, he doesn't speak.
The voice of 1. 25 billion Indians echoes from the Red Fort.
And I am happy that for the last 3 years, for 15th August, I get suggestions from every corner of the country that what should I say on August 15
This time also I invite you and you must send me your views on the Narendra ModiApp at MyGov.
I myself read it and I will try to express it in the time I have on August 15.
For the last 3 times, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speeches that my speech becomes slightly long.
I have tried to make rules for me in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can do it.
But I intend to try this time how I make my speech a little
Let's see whether it gets success or not.
I want to do another thing today, my countrymen.
India has a social economy in the economy.
And we should never underestimate him.
Our festivals, our festivals, these are just occasions of joy and joy.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And a comfortable natural joy is also added to these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in the family, brotherhood in society.
Individuals and society connect.
There is a comfortable journey from person to Samasti.
Importance becomes an opportunity to move towards adult.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making Rakhis in small domestic industries.
From Khadi to silk threads, how many types of rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
Rakhi makers, sellers, sweets and hundreds of thousands of businesses join a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, the family goes through this.
We burn the lamp in Deepawali, it is just a light festival, it is not just a festival, it is a decoration of the house, it is not so.
He is directly related to those poor families who have given small soil.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the people of the country are more aware than me, are more active.
For the last one month, conscious citizens have written letters to me for the environment.
He has urged you to tell about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people plan on the choice of soil Ganesh.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to say on this subject before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
125 years and 1. 25 billion Indians, Lokmanya Tilak ji had started the public Ganesha Festival for the basic spirit of unity and awareness of society and collective rites.
Once again, we compete with essays in this year of Ganeshotsav, discuss meetings and remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure you all will join me and it will benefit from this that the poor artisans, the poor, the artists who make idols will get employment, the poor will fill the stomach.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for many festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that the field of education, economic sector, social sector, sports, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, getting new heights.
We are proud of our daughters, we are despairing.
Our daughters have performed well in the Women's Cricket World Cup in the past.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I was very happy to talk to them, but I was feeling that the World Up could not win it was a big burden on them.
He had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, See, nowadays the era of media is such that the expectations are increased so much and when the success is not achieved, it also turns into an outrage.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the boundaries and speak some such things, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters were not successful in the World Cup, 1. 25 billion Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only did these daughters have to bear the burden on those daughters, but they have glorifyed and respected what these daughters have done.
I see a comfortable change and I told these daughters that you see, this kind of good fortune has only been given to you and get out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, once again I remember August Kranti, once again on 9th August, once again I am reminding you on 15th August, and once again I am reminding you of 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countrymen should make a 5-year roadmap to prove the resolution.
We all have to reach new heights, reach and reach the country.
Come together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will be better and move forward with this belief.
Changing weather
This time heat was also very much
But it is better that the rain is going on in your footsteps at a time .
Rainfall in many parts of the country has made the weather pleasant
After the rains cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past days
And we all have seen that however turmoil in life, however stress, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain also changes our minds.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji celebrates the countrymen with great faith and fervor in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra is celebrated .
And the country is closely connected to Lord Jagannath .
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor
And very few people will know, there is a word in English language uggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And it is also found that this word has emerged from Jagannath ' s chariot in the dictionary meaning of this juggernaut .
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country and also salute Lord Jagannath ji.
The diversity of India is also its feature, the diversity of India is also the power of India.
The holy month of Ramadan celebrated with sacred feelings in all the places of worship .
Now the festival of Eid is
I extend my best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramadan is the month of pure donation, the month of distributing happiness and the happiness that they distribute, the more happiness increases.
Let us all share the treasures of the joyous with the inspiration of these sacred festivals and move forward the country.
In this holy month of Ramadan, a big inspirational event of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me.
Nearly three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters reside in that small village, in a way more population belongs to our Muslim family brothers and sisters.
The people of the village decided to make toilets together .
And this individual toilet is also supported by the government and the amount of assistance was given to them about Rs 17 lakhs .
These 17 lakhs you spend for other facilities in the village .
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this holy occasion of Ramadan on the occasion of the well-being of the society.
We know that there are three states in our country Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana also declared this week
I express my gratitude to the administration, governance and people-to-people of these five states for fulfilling this work.
We are well aware that in the life of the person, in the life of the society, there is a lot of hard work to do.
If our handwriting is bad, if he has to be cured then he has to try to be very aware for a long time.
Then go to the body, the habit of mind changes.
The subject of cleanliness is similar
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone ' s attention has to be attracted
Good inspirational events will also have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that today cleanliness is not a government programme.
This is becoming a movement of the people and the people of the society.
And when people sitting in the government go ahead with this work, how much power increases.
In the past, a very excellent incident came to me, which I would like to say before you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration took a big job with public participation .
100 hours of non-stop campaign
and what was the goal
Ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 gram panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and government have successfully completed the construction of ten thousand toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages in Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a big inspirational example while devoting your hard work.
They come to Narendra ModiApp, come to MyGov.
Shriman Prakash Tripathi recalled the Emergency and wrote that on June 25, he has presented it as a black era in the history of democracy.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a ritual.
Regular awareness about democracy is essential and therefore, those who hurt democracy have to be remembered and they have to move forward in the direction of good things of democracy.
1975- June 25 - It was a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget I
In a way, the country was converted into a prison.
The opponent voice was suppressed
The country's dignitaries, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were locked in jails.
The justice system was also unable to avoid the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely wasted.
Democracy lovers fought a big battle and a country like India, such a large country, when the opportunity was found, how democracy was spread in the rivalry of the people of India, through the election, I demonstrated that power.
We have to empower this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is feeling the pride of doing this in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - the entire world became Yogamaya.
People welcomed the sun rays from water to mountain in the morning through yoga.
Who will be a Hindustani, who will not be proud of this.
It is not that Yoga had not happened earlier, but today when Yoga has been tied in the threads of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
All the nearest countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
The Great All of India in China, when people practiced Yoga on it, people at the World Heritage Site Machu Pichu at the sea level at 2400 metres above the sea level.
People Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France
There were 70 places in small places like Singapore and they have launched a week-long campaign.
NCD has removed 10 stamps of International Yoga Day.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organised in NEEDUARTER.
Each of the world's diplomats have participated in this.
This time again Yoga also worked as a world record
Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad together made a new world record in Gujarat.
I also got the opportunity to participate in Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the good fortune to do yoga in the rain
In Siachen where our soldiers have 20 minutes, 25 and 40 degrees temperatures, they have also done yoga.
Everybody has made Yoga a part of its duty as well as its duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should do yoga together and share their photographs.
Some T Channel also carried forward this thing
Sir, I have a question that in Recently, in Kerala we had heard you that we should give a memento in place of the boost as we give.
You have started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but we are not getting to see this much right now.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that we will not pay the boost, we will either give books or handlooms and handkerchie will welcome it.
And Khadi's handkerchie so that Khadi can also be encouraged.
As long as I was in Gujarat, we had become the habit of all, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But when he went to Kerala, he became aware once again.
And I ' ve just started giving the following information in the government
We can also gradually make a nature
And Bouvet ' s age is very low .
Once in hand, let's leave again
But if they book, then in a way they become part of the house and become part of the family.
And when I am talking about this, how historical is the value of such things
When I went to UK last year, Britan's ueen, ueen Liabeth invited me to eat.
There was a maternal environment
He also gave me food with great love, but later he showed me a small khadi and a handkerchie woven with thread in emotional voice and he said that when I was married, this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi sent me in the presence as a good wishes for marriage.
How many years have passed, but this handwriting given by Mahatma Gandhi has been kept in hand.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be victims of criticism.
But despite this, such things should continue to be done, efforts should be made.
Now I cannot say that I will go somewhere and if someone comes with a bout, I will refuse it, I will not be able to do this.
But still there will be criticism, but if you keep talking, then gradually there will be improvement
My dear countrymen, there are many types of work as the Prime Minister.
The files are immersed, but I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters daily from the letters that come to me and because of this I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got the opportunity to read such a letter, I think I must tell you.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewive of Madurai, Arulmozhi Saranan - they sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in my family, then the family would get some financial help.
So I took money from the bank and started some work towards supplementing some goods from the market.
In such a scenario, I came to know that the Government of India has created a system called 'Marketplace'.
So I have also registered myself in it. I want to tell the people of the country that if you also get the opportunity then you will get the opportunity.
There ' s a new kind of system
And then he has to order it
So those who registry within the GM, all the departments of the government keep looking at it.
The intermediaries don ' t find things very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has registrated all the goods that he can give on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter they have written to me is a big entertainment.
This is the Employment
This is the opportunity to promote the industry.
Perhaps Arulmozhi ji had not written a letter to me, I might not have noticed that a householder is working a little far away from the system of GM, his goods can be purchased to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the country .
It also has transparency, there is employment and there is an entrepreneurship in it.
I would like to say that those who want to sell their belongings to the government in such a way should add more to it.
I believe that this is an excellent source of Minimum Governance and Maimum Governance and what is the goal of Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the feature of India that if our feet are on the earth associated with yoga, then our dreams are also to cross the horizons of the remote heavens.
India has shown a lot in sports and science in the past.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on space.
Two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite.
And these satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America besides India.
And this nano-satellite campaign of India will help us a lot in the field of farming, in the field of agriculture and in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the most weighing healthy satellite in the satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country had comparison with the weights of elephants, so you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the field of space.
A thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on June 19
You must be aware that when we successfully set up a place for the Mars Mission in the orbit, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Our scientific journey to complete a thousand days is an important stop inside our space journey.
Even in sports, we are seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has come to the notice that along with studies, our younger generations have started looking at their future in sports and because of our sportspersons, because of their supremacy, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, India's badminton player Kidambi Srikanth has increased the country's honor by winning the Indonesia Open
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athlete PT Usha ji's School of Athletics.
The number of sports and sports sports sports are also being encouraged by us.
Sports plays a very important role in the development of personality
The importance of sports is very much in the overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports even in our family then they should give them opportunities.
Everyone should save dreams for the next limpic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the atmosphere of rains and festivals, in a way the feeling of this period is new.
I once again wish you all the best while talking to the next mind .
We will hardly forget this year's heat.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramadan has begun.
On the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community, this holy month.
This is such a country that those who believe in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have inspired the art of living together.
And finally, be it religion, sect, ideology, tradition, give us this message of peace, unity and goodwill.
It will surely help in pursuing this path of peace, unity and harmony of the holy month of Ramadan.
I once again extend my best wishes to everyone.
I am happy that many people have given me foodback.
Individually, everyone showed me the enthusiasm to tell my words.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not been able to hear the message of everyone, so many things have come.
However, somebody has tried to learn music from a simple point of view, some people are trying to learn new things using your tubes and trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dances, some are learning ड्राmas, some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing, living, understanding nature is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much struggle India had to fight to get freedom, how many freedom fighters spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to your generation in this regard.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed for this country.
Many years ago, I went to Andaman Nicobar.
The cellular went to see the jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book born in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What kind of torture the freedom fighters have suffered.
When I read a book that was born by Savarkar ji, and I got the inspiration to see cellular jail.
There is also a light and sound show, it is a very inspirational programme.
There was no state in India, there would be no language speaker in India who had been punished with black water for independence in the jail of Andaman and in this cellular jail.
Today, the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji is the birth anniversary of every language speaker, the people of every province and every generation had suffered from torture.
I will surely tell the younger generation of the country how people had suffered the punishment of the freedom that we have received, if we go to cellular jail and see why black water was called.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with nature means nurturing Better Planet.
And who can tell this better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi ji used to say several times that the world that we will not see, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also bear it.
Open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe the fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy emerges when the five Mahabhutas are connected with them.
We all have experienced this, but we do not register it, we do not connect it in a thread, in a formula.
After this, you must see that whenever you have contact with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and therefore the global campaign to connect with the nature of June 5 should be our own campaign.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefits.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the original of power in the Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is in a way the largest guide of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
It has been said here that Mother Land: sons are important separation:
It has been said in the Vedas that the security that we have is due to our earth.
The earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, then one thing is evident that Mahatma Buddha was born under three trees, his knowledge and his Maha Parinirvana.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
A very big campaign of plantation is going on in almost all the states as soon as the rain comes.
Plants are planted in millions of rupees.
The children of the school are also connected, the society-servicemen are connected, the NGs are connected, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we will also promote this work of plantation and contribute to this year.
My dear countrymen, June 21, now it has become a day to be known for the world on June 21.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
This World Yoga Day of June 21 has failed in every corner in a very short span of time, connecting people.
On the one hand, many talents of scattering in the world are showing their distorted faces, at such a time the world has a very big contribution to India.
Through yoga, we have added the world to a formula.
As yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
Today, due to the lifestyle, due to adversity and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
And even at a young age, this situation has reached.
The role of yoga is important to take unnatural medicines and to pass the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a clock.
Yoga is the guarantee of both wealth and wealth.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible to experience the difference between the body, the body, the ideas, the ideals and the spirit of health.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments of the world about Yoga Day, to all the leaders.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga and have announced some rewards.
Gradually work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and told me that this time, on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family should do yoga simultaneously.
Whether grandparents or grandparents or parents, sons and daughters, all three generations should simultaneously do yoga and upload their picture.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be a good coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched a campaign with a sleeve with augmentor and had a very interesting experience.
This picture of three generations will surely awaken praise for the country and the world.
You must send me a picture on the Narendra ModiApp, wherever three generations do yoga at MyGov.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be a picture that will be a guarantee tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks for International Yoga Day.
You should also spread the subject of Yoga for three weeks and add people.
In a way, this is a movement of preventive health care.
I invite you all to join it.
This phone call will also give you attention: Prayam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, on Modi ji T. and on social media, I always see that the people of that place wherever you go, they pay special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
The elders and children have also been aware of cleanliness.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading the dirt on the road, stretching.
There the government machinery works for cleanliness but these days there is a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleanliness programmes.
The media also gives him great priority and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a very big cleaning campaign.
I did not even see it adding it.
But when this phone call came, I started thinking and I saw that it was true.
You can imagine how I am happy and how the country is justifying these things in a better way.
What will be more happy for me that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be the habit of getting ready, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is pleasant and inspiring for any sanitation lover in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I don't know if I can do it or not.
Modi ji now, while deciding the migration, whoever asks for the migration, tell them that if I have to call then how will the level of cleanliness be
How many tons of waste and waste will you present me on the basis of that I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big will be the work of humanity
One thing I would like to say that we do not believe that this waste is wealth, it is a source.
Don't see it just as a garbag.
Once we start accepting this waste as wealth, many new ways of waste management will come to us.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a very important campaign of waste management with the help of representatives of the cities.
On June 5, on the World Environment Day, solid waste and live waste in about 4 thousand cities of the country are going to be available to connect it.
Two types of wastes will be available, one green color and the other blue color.
Like the waste that comes out of the kitchen, the skin of vegetables, the remaining food, the skin of the eggs, the leaves of trees and plants etc. are all wet waste and put it in green trash.
All these things are those who work in the field, if you remember the color of the farm green, then what to put in the green trash will be remembered.
Today, I have to recall with pride that if a person decides in his mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is the same.
And the way in which he connected the people of all the regions and converted them into a mass movement, it is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a regional block of Jammu and Kashmir was told that the regional block has been opened defecation free.
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I have been told that this entire movement has been made the highest among the women in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He inspired people from homes, streets and streets to spread awareness amongst them.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for months, for the last few days, for the last few months, for the last few months, for the news, for the TV channels, for the sake of social media, the accounting of the present government is going on for 3 years.
I see this process as a very healthy signs.
How has this 3-year tenure been done on every criterion
The people of every section of the society have done analysis.
And democracy is an excellent process.
And I am clear that the governments should be accountable in democracy, the public should account for their work.
I am grateful to all those people who took out time and discussed the depths of our work, appreciated somewhere, somewhere supported, somewhere the shortcomings were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
Whether it is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, it is to learn from it and move forward with the help of it.
Constructive artificialism emphasizes democracy.
For an aware nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, everything has an impact on me as it is on the mind of any ordinary citizen.
Whenever I started talking about my mind, I didn't even think about it.
It seems like I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk to the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President, the speaker, that he took out time and the people sitting in such a senior post gave this importance to the mindset.
In a way, the point of mind in itself gave a new dimension.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this mind, they had ever discussed with me.
An artisan, who lives in Abu Dhabi, was known as Akbar Saheb. Akbar Saheb proposed to prepare the art of Mann Ki Baat through his art and to show his love for a single rupee, Akbar Saheb made the words of Mann Ki Baat art.
I am grateful to Akbar.
My dear countrymen, whenever you meet the next time, there will be rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the results will start from a fresh start. And as soon as the rain comes, a new joy, a new smell and a fragrance.
Come, let us all move forward in this environment loved nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
Talk of mind, April 2017
s.
Can this aspect be given a bit of emphasis in skill development
You run the cycle, but the three-wheeler cycle that takes people - has you ever tried to run
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the ease of their children .
Those whose ease has ended, there will be a lot of reliance and where the ease will continue, there will still be a slightly big business in those families.
But at such a time, I will say that listen to the things that I have spoken to the students in the matter of mind for the last time, at the time of the examination, those things will definitely benefit you.
Today is 26 March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Banga-Bandhu
And I wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, we have a shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize but also the Englishmen gave him the title of Knighthod.
And when the British killed Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who raised their voices and this was the period when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on the minds of this incident.
In adolescence, the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child laughing in the fields and fields.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old child Bhagat, our dear one, the inspiration of all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companion, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the incident of March 23 - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru's face was not afraid of satisfaction - death.
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the freedom of Mother India.
And these three brave men are still inspiration for us
We will not be able to decorate the saga of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the whole British emperor was scared of these three youths .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but how to move forward with them, its concern was to the British.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23
Was stolen, which is not usually done
And later, by bringing his body to Punjab today, the British had burnt quietly.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt a kind of vibration in that land.
And I will surely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity, whenever you go to Punjab, go to the place of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt's tomb.
This was the time when the freedom movement, his intensity, his business was increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, its appearance was first seen in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in the way of struggle.
This was the period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-workers in Ahmedabad, and all of them had a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and functioning.
Gandhi returned from abroad in 1915 and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country .
Today, on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha.
Imagine that a person who came back to India in 1915, only two years' tenure
Neither did the country know them, nor did they have the effect, it was just the beginning.
We can guess how hard they have to suffer at that time, how hard they have to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skills, the power to know the neighbourhood of Mahatma Gandhi's Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour, to organise and inspire the poor and the neglected individual to fight in front of the British Sultanate, to bring them to the ground for struggle.
And so as we feel Mahatma Gandhi ' s bravery
But if you think of Gandhi, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of a very study for any person who started public life.
How can public life be started, how hard work has to be done and how Gandhi had done, we can learn from them.
And that was the time when we listen to the names of the big leaders, Gandhiji had sent Rajendra Babu at that time, Acharya Kripalani ji and all of them to the villages.
Prisoning on one side, on the other hand, spend yourself in creative work
A wonderful balance was in Gandhi's style of functioning.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be the disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a large empire - a complete new imagination was established by Gandhi not by words but by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will be the Indian who does not want to change India, who will be the Indian who does not want to become a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government programme nor a political party's manifestation nor is it a project.
India calls for 1. 25 billion Indians.
This is the feeling that 1. 25 billion people want to create a grand India in collaboration.
There are many people who go to the hospital daily, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
There are many people, somebody is hungry, so they worry about his food
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
People's service is the Lord-service, it's in our rugs
Once we look at him as a collective, in an organised form, it is a great power.
It is very natural to see it from a different perspective and it is inevitable in democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion Indians resolve, decide the path to accomplish the resolution, take one step after another, then the dream of New India can be proved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from the budget, the government is from the project, the government is from the money.
If every citizen resolves that I follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibility with complete honesty, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diseases in my life.
You will be able to see this country, which is dreaming of a New India, in the eyes of 1. 25 billion people.
It means that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows duty
So why shouldn't we join Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you
My dear countrymen, I also want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people participated in the Digital Payment Digital movement.
How can there be no cash transactions, its curiosity has increased, the poor are also trying to learn from the poor and gradually people are also moving towards it without any cash trade.
Since the demonetization ban, there has been a lot of increase in different ways of digital payment.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 1. 25 billion Indians resolve to work for two and a half thousand crore digital transactions in this year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You don't have a imagination, but you can serve the country's greatest and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been organized for public education and public awareness in the past.
There is a resolve to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward scheme .
Nearly twelve and a half million people have received this reward of consumer .
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
And this Digital Mela is going to be concluded on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14, as it was decided very long ago.
There will be a great event in the Hereafter after a hundred days have been completed .
There is also a provision for a larger draw .
We should contribute to how cash is low, how the behavior of notes is low.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever I ask people for suggestions for the matter of mind, there are many suggestions.
But I have seen that every time there is a request for cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a 11th student, has sent a message by telephone: - Honorable Principal, Prime Minister, I salute you.
First of all , you are very grateful that you have won this election with heavy votes .
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is .
I go through that river every day, in which people also put a lot of waste and contaminate the rivers
He comes through Rispana bridge and comes to my house
For this river, we also took out a rally and interacted with the people, but it did not benefit.
I want to tell you that by sending a team or through the Newspaper, this thing should be exposed, thank you.
See brothers and sisters, how much is the pain of a 11th class daughter
How angry is he looking at the waste in that river
I consider it a good sign .
I want to get angry at the dirt in the minds of 1. 25 billion people.
Once there will be anger, anger will arise, anger will arise, we will start doing something against dirt.
And the good thing is that the singer himself is also expressing his anger, suggesting me, but at the same time he is also saying that he has made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
Indeed , hatred towards filth is increasing .
Be awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But the sanitation movement is more connected to the habit
Work is difficult, but I have to do it.
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, this feeling that has awakened in itself indicates good results.
Whatever you are listening to the Gayatri in my mind today, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of them have expressed concern about food security.
They don't even fill the stomach and then leave it there.
You have ever thought how much we waste this juvenile we leave.
Have you ever thought that if you don't leave the juvenile then how much poor can be filled with the stomach
This is not the subject that I have to explain.
Well, when mother serves small children in our family, she says that take as much as you can eat, as you can.
Some or the other efforts are being made, but yet indifference on this subject is a social treason.
Injustice to the poor is I.
Secondly, if there is a saving, then the family also has economic benefits.
Think about society, it is a good thing, but it is a matter of fact that the family also has the benefits.
I am not insisting on this subject, but I would like to increase this awareness.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India.
Their lives can also inspire us not to jeopardize.
We take as much food as I have.
See, these are the ways for change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body, they always say - keep the stomach a little open, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it comes to health, the World Health Day is on 7th April, World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a goal of health for all by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word 'Epression', but if there is a word meaning then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from expression.
The problem is that we cannot understand this in our neighbourhood and perhaps we are also hesitant to speak openly in this regard.
Those who feel exercising themselves do not speak anything because they feel a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that expression is not such that it cannot be freed.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is that instead of exercising the experiment, it needs an extension.
Between your colleagues, between friends, between parents, brothers and teachers, openly say what is happening to you.
Sometimes the children living in the hostels, especially in the loneliness, get more trouble.
All the people in the house are going out somewhere and they say - No, no, I don't want to come today - I like to stay alone.
You have ever noticed why it does .
You must believe that it is the first step towards expression.
If he does not like to live in a group, he is going to a corner alone, then try not to let this happen.
Give him the opportunity to live in the middle of those people who speak to him openly.
While talking openly about laughing, inspire him to expression, expel what is lying inside him.
This is the best way .
And expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases
As the Diabetes becomes the host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities to sustain, fight, courage, decision-making.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your environment can also prevent you from going to the excitement and if you have gone then you can bring it out.
There is another way to do this.
Help your mind, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, the pain within you will be eradicated.
If you are trying to understand their griefs, you will do with service, there will be a new confidence in you.
You can easily lighten the burden of your mind by connecting with others, by serving someone and by serving with selflessness.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Travel towards stress free, stress free and happy mind - Yoga helps a lot.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
This will be the third year.
If you have any suggestion regarding the third International Yoga Day in your mind then you must send your suggestions through my mobile application, guide me.
The songs and poetic compositions that you can prepare in the context of yoga should be done so that people can easily understand it.
I would like to talk to the mothers and sisters today because today there has been a lot of discussion on health and health.
So in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
Those working class women in our country, those women who are working in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and they are welcome but women also have special obligations.
The Government of India has made a very big decision.
These women of the working class will be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, at the time of pregnancy, at the time of delivery, at the time of maternity leave which was available for 12 weeks.
There are perhaps two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And its original objective is to take care of that newborn, the future citizen of India, the proper care of her in the early days of her birth, if she gets a lot of love, then these children will grow up and become the trust of the country.
The health of mothers will also be good and that is why this is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the ordinary sector.
My dear countrymen, this is the sacred festival of Ramnavami on April 5, Mahavir Jayanti on April 9, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on April 14.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us, empower us to resolve for New India.
After two days, I extend my best wishes to you all for this new year, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nav Sanvatsar.
This is the time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after spring yield.
This New Year is celebrated in different corners of our country.
In Maharashtra, Gudi-Padwa, Ugadi as New Year in Andhra-Karnatak, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Pooja in Awadh region, Join-Seetal in Mithila of Bihar and Satwani in Magadh are celebrated on New Year.
Innumerable, India is a country full of so many diversities.
Winter season is now to go
The season of spring has buried us all in life .
New leaves start coming in the trees after the fall .
Flowers bloom
Gardens and gardens become green .
The echo of the birds starts feeling the heart .
Not only flowers, fruits are also seen shining in the sun blooming on tree branches
The fruits of the summer are seen in the spring of mango .
At the same time, yellow flowers of mustard bind the farmers in the fields
Tesu or plasmatic flowers indicate the arrival of Holi .
Wealthy people have described the moments of the change of weather as joy .
Festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi puts colors of happiness in the life of human beings
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood, humanity, we are going to leave Falgun in the last month and are ready to welcome the new month's chaitra.
Indeed , this is a coincidence of two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to the millions of citizens of the country that before I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On Narendra ModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And so he said that I will give some information about the launch and interceptor missions of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, I am very grateful to you for remembering the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to reach knowledge and knowledge, technology, science has recorded its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in India's life.
Our scientists have raised the head of India proudly in front of the world
SERV has successfully launched 104 satellites in space through Mega Mission, including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together to space.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is a successful launch of 38th PSU
It is a historic achievement for SR, but for the entire India.
Brothers and sisters, It is very important in these 104 satellites - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will help in mapping the pictures, resources, infrastructure, assessment of development and planning of Urban Development.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water is the source of the country, how can it be used, what should be taken care of, this will help us a lot on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as we go
He has started his work .
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that they have led this campaign, our young scientists, our female scientists, they have done it.
Such strong participation of youth and women is a very proud aspect of the success of ISR.
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
For the general public, for the service of the nation, for the sake of space science, they have always maintained their objectives and they are also creating new records.
Our scientists, their entire team is less than the congratulations we give.
Shobha ji has asked another question and he is about India's security.
India has achieved a very big achievement about it.
This has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji has taken care of this important thing.
This mission with interception technology has achieved success by placing the enemy's miracle at a height of about 100 kilometers from the earth during its trip.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have this greatness.
When we see new technologies, there is a new scientific proverb, then we are happy.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life .
And those who have specific intellectual talent, they do not allow curiosity to live in the form of curiosity, they also raise questions within it, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And the same curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery.
They do not sit quietly until they get the answer
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, then we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full break is impossible
Efforts to know the universe, the rules of the universe, the mind of the human being continues.
New science, new technologies are born from it.
And every technology, every new science gives birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said that our younger generation should increase the attraction towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientist becomes a permanent change in the life of generations in the coming ages .
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a big Universal Competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation has been invented
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science for solutions .
It means that people of this kind of role in the society are very much in the country.
And our society is also becoming technology-driven.
Arrangements are being driven by technology
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, there is a big emphasis on digitization
Gradually people are moving out of cash and moving towards digital currency.
Digital transmission is also increasing rapidly in India.
In our country, the Lucky Customer Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme have received huge support in the past.
Nearly two months have passed, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of great pleasure that so far 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than one and a half crore rupees have been given to the people who have taken forward this great campaign.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred customers have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
More than four thousand traders are those who have received rewards of Rs. 50,000.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are getting benefits.
When I asked his analysis, Brothers and sisters, Look, only youngsters come and I am happy that those who are 15 years old and those who receive the rewards are also those who are 50-70 years old.
Mr. Santosh ji from Mysore has written on Narendra ModiApp that he got a record of Rs.
Now they run cars, but in a way they have become ambassadors of this scheme.
All the moneylenders are given the knowledge of digital all the time .
They keep talking with so much enthusiasm that they also encourage others.
I would urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and the beneficiaries of this Locky Customer Scheme, either the Digi-Dhan Trade Yojana.
You must lead this movement.
And in a way, the fight against corruption and black money has a very important role in it.
Everybody associated with this work has a new anti-corruption centre in the country.
In a way, you are the soldiers of Swachhata.
You know that the Lucky Customer Scheme - hundred days will be completed when I
April 14 is the festival of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On April 14, a pride of Rs. 1 crore will be drawn.
Nearly forty-fifteen days have survived.
Can you do a job keeping Baba Saheb Ambedkar in mind
Now Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary has gone.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and BI
I would like to say that the foundation laid by Dr. Baba Saheb has to be strengthened.
I have to reach BIM App by connecting everyone at home to 125 crore hands.
For the last two-three months, the impact of this movement is that many townships, many villages and many cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a very big contribution to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village empowers the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the food stores.
This year, record food production has been done due to the hard work of farmers in our country.
All the signs are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time the crops in the fields have started flowing like Pongal and Baisakhi are celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I would especially like to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated different pulses on almost two hundred and ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service to the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are specially thankful for the way the farmers of my country have worked hard on their heads and eyes and produced pulses records.
My dear countrymen, this is going on in our country, by the government, by the society, by institutions, by organisations, by everyone, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is seen behaving aware about cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is constantly making efforts.
In the past, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, under the leadership of our Secretary, was organised by senior officials of 23 State Governments in Telangana.
And not only in the closed room in Warangal of Telangana state, it is important to use the work of direct sanitation.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise organized in Hyderabad on February 17-18
The toilet pits of six houses were opened and the officials themselves showed that the pits used for two pit toilets could be opened and used again.
He also showed how comfortable the toilets of this new technology are and there is no difficulty in cleaning them, there is no hesitation, the psychological barrier is also not obstructed.
And we also clean the pits of a toilet as well.
And the result of this endeavour was that the media of the country also promoted it a lot, gave importance to it and it is natural when an I
If AS officers themselves clean the toilet pit then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And those toilet pits that are clean and those whom we consider to be waste, but in terms of fertilizer, these are black gold in a way.
We can see what wealth is from waste.
And it has been proved .
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected to the second pit.
In six to twelve months the waste deposited in the pit becomes completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle the decomposed waste and is extremely important fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well aware of NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassim - This is fulfilled by nutrients and it is considered to be an excellent fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The manner in which the government has taken these initiatives, others must have done such experiments.
And now there ' s a special programme of sanitation news in Doordarshan .
The more these things will be exposed, the more benefits will be there.
Even in the government, different departments celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada regulations.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, along with them are going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are also going to pursue the Swachhta Abhiyan for the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, increases confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our disabled players in Rio Paralleympics.
In the final of the Blind T20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan and increased the pride of the country by becoming the World Champion for the second consecutive time.
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievements of these Divyang companions.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, strong and brave and determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone.
and the name of the nation is illuminating with its achievements .
In the last few days, Asian Rugbi Sevens Trophy won the Silver Medal by our female players.
My best wishes to all those players
On March 8, the whole world celebrates Womens Day
In India, giving importance to daughters, increasing awareness about them in family and society, sensitivity increased
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, this movement is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it ' s not just a government programme
This has become a social sensitivity, a campaign for public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common man, has forced people to think on this burning issue in every corner of the country and has brought about changes in the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When news comes that the festival was celebrated on the birth of daughter, so much joy comes.
In a way , positive thinking towards daughters is becoming a cause for social acceptance .
I have heard that Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been added to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and along with orphaned children adopted by the district administration, ensuring their education.
A campaign is being launched for education of village-village daughters under the programme of every household knock in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to re-recruit the girls who had started their school campaign and to inspire them to read again.
It means that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao this movement has also taken many forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are connected to him
According to local requirements , it has been turned
You are also actively connected to
I get to know a lot from you
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the mind of the village and the poor reaches me.
I am very grateful to you for your contribution.
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav celebrated all over India
Someone can imagine how the personality will be, even after thousands of years, every festival comes with innovation, brings new inspiration, brings new energy and thousands of years old life can find solutions to the problems and inspire everybody from the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes to pick up rocks, sometimes to pick up leaves of food, i.e. a new feeling in everything and therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I focus on two Mohans.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, then the other Charkhadhari Mohan
Except the banks of Yamuna, the Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan went to the coast of the sea in Gujarat and settled in the city of Dwarka and came to the coast of Yamuna and breathed the last breath of life in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, in the conditions of that time, even thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle, to avoid the struggle, to fulfil his duties, to fulfil his duties, to fulfil his thoughts, and Chakradhari Mohan also chose such a way for freedom, to conserve human values, to empower the basic elements of personality.
Be it the importance of selfless service, knowledge or the importance of moving ahead smiling in the midst of all fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Krishna and Jagatguru have also been known as Vande Jagadgurum.
Today, when we are discussing the festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is discussed not only in India but also all over the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served those farmers who were being discriminated against in Champaran, he served those mill laborers who were not being given proper wages, they considered the service of poor, destitute, weak and hungry people as the supreme duty of their lives.
Whenever anybody needs, Mahatma Gandhi will always be present for service.
He not only stressed on service but also stressed on self-confidence associated with him.
The meaning of the word service is to be done with joy - service Paramo Dharma :
But, as well as excellent joy, self comfort: The feeling of this feeling is also inherent in service.
We can understand this well by Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity, this was everything.
Whether it is Phoeni Carm in Africa or Tolstoy Carm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, at all places, in a unique style, they have always been stressed on social development community mobility.
It is my privilege that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to the goddess Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to lay emphasis on the organization and spirit of service.
This is the spirit that we have to bring in our practical life.
In the true sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true tribute.
No countrymen
And collectiveness has its own strength .
This whole, in the programmes of Gandhi 150, there should be collectiveness and service too.
Our Ladies Club is
The ladies of the modern age will continue to do the work of the club, but all the criteria of the Ladies Club will work together with some or the other service work.
can do a lot
I believe that 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore ventures.
There is no boundary that comes in the mind - just a goodwill, a goodwill, a goodwill and a service to full dedication and a free comfort: - for a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi, is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art Museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings arising from within your mind, the creation of any big literature may be more powerful and maybe in today's time, in your sight, in the form of a burial written by your pen, perhaps it may be more relevant.
Several programmes, competitions and exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But in this context one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were specially interesting in it .
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's presidential election is recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Art House.
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase their art work during the session .
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose art work increases the beauty of our Constitution .
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his art practice has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nand Lal Bose visited the surrounding villages of Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India.
This precious artist has a tremendous discussion in the engagement
Once again on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, with the best wishes, some or the other resolution from every Indian, I hope.
For the country, for the society, something should be done for someone else.
This will be good, true, authentic workforce to Bapu
You will remember that in the last few years, we have launched Swachhta Hi Seva Abhiyan across the country for about 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start from 11th September .
During this time, we will leave our homes and work towards Mahatma Gandhi through labour.
Be it home or streets, square-square or drains, schools, colleges and all public places have to conduct a great campaign of cleanliness.
Likewise , we have to finish the single use plastic items together .
This will also save money and they will also be able to contribute to protecting the environment
This time when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated on 2nd October, we will not only dedicate him to the nation, but will also lay the foundation for a new mass movement against plastic across the country on this occasion.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal of all these plastic wastes.
This can be recycled
can be made fuel .
Thus , till Diwali , we can also fulfil the work of safe settlement of this plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is a gem of knowledge in a way.
We can get what we want in life .
These days my contact has become very low but I had a lot of contact.
The fools call the stone a gem
Our culture has a lot of glory in food .
Until We have turned the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and infants, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the nutrition campaign, nutrition is being created by modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought to my attention .
Indeed , there has been a great movement of paddy in the land .
In the days of harvesting , the Anganwadi servants gather from mankind a rough grain .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor becomes a vigilant civil society worker in a way .
After that he becomes dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of that movement.
We all have heard of food processing in every corner of India in the family .
These rites are performed when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
uicked food not solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 why children should be given complicated food on the occasion of food processing so that people can be aware of it.
This is a very magnificent initiative that can be adopted everywhere
People in many states run Date Food campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, if there is a auspicious day, people of the family go to Anganwadi to make nutritious food and taste, go to schools and the people of the family themselves serve children and feed them.
They share their joy and express their joy .
There is a wonderful meeting of service and joy .
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, both the poor and the rich are affected by malnutrition.
Monthly Nutrition Campaign to be celebrated throughout the country
You must join it, get information, add something new. You also contribute.
If you bring one and a half person out of malnutrition meaning we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time, when I was thinking about the matter of mind, I was sure that there would be a lot of questions about this matter and it would have happened. And in the last few weeks, wherever I met people, the men vs.
With this episode, I am not only connected to the youth of the world but I have never thought that the youth will become my place in such a way.
I never thought of how many diverse things our country and the youth of the world pay attention to
I never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of the youth around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that from wherever I got the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister and because of the International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I sit near anyone in the world, then some five-seven minutes will question me about yoga.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not talked to me about Yoga and has experienced me all over the world.
But these days there ' s a new experience
Anyone who gets the opportunity to talk about Wildlife, discusses the issue of environment.
Tiger, ion, organism and I am surprised that how much people are interested.
Discovery has planned to broadcast this programme in 165 countries in their language .
I hope that this programme will help the world in introducing the sensitivity of Indias message, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the rites of India, this episode of this discovery channel will be very helpful, and now people want to know the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our India.
But one more entertaining thing is that some people also ask me one thing with hesitation that Modi ji should tell you that you were speaking Hindi and if you do not know Bear Grills Hindi then how would you be so fast
Is this subsequently audited
It has been shooting so frequently and what has happened
They ask with a great curse .
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that technology was used a lot in interaction with Bear Grills
So I used to say Hindi but he used to hear English and because of that dialogue became very easier and this is a miracle of technology .
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also go to places related to nature and lifestyle .
I have said before, I must say that you must go to the North-East in your life.
will expand within you .
The country filled with diversity will fill you with diversity as a teacher, you too.
Last month, I had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
Tiger population in India is 2967
A few years ago , half of it was very difficult to do
Tiger Summit in Russia's Saint Petersburg on Tigers in 2010
It took a resolution expressing concern over the declining number of tigers in the world
This resolution was to double the number of tigers all over the world by 2022 Twenty-two
We doubled the number of Tigers here in 2019 itself
Not only the number of tigers in India but the number of protected areas and community reserves has also increased.
When I was relating to tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gujarat's Gir.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the lion's habitat was shrinking in the forests of Gir.
their number was decreasing
We took several steps after one in Gir .
Decision to deploy women guards in 2007
Improve infrastructure to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife then only talk about conservation .
But now we have to think about compassion ahead of conservation.
Our scriptures also have a very good guidance in this regard .
Therefore we need to not only protect our forests, vegetation and wildlife but also create an environment so that they can flourish properly .
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893
This young saint of India, who shouted the human race all over the world, left India's stunning identity inside the world.
The words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda, 1893 forced the world to change the views of looking towards India, which the slave was looking at India with great distortion.
Come, Swami Vivekananda ji, who had seen the form of India, had to know the strength of India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 29th August is celebrated as National Sports Day.
This will be a big entertainment campaign for all children, elderly, youth and women and it will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today
I would like to make you aware of it and set some goals together for the country for India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you in India on August 29.
Come, let's go with a new emotion, a new resolution, a new power.
My dear countrymen, today you will meet so much in the matter of mind.
I'll wait for your words, your suggestions
Come, let us all come together to fulfil Gandhi's dreams to make India of the dreams of freedom fighters:
Come on , expressing inner joy with service .
My dear countrymen, salute you all.
On 26th January, our Republic Day was celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm in the corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of citizens, the rights of citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this rites are also celebrated, which makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
But in our country, the dedication of citizens and the rights of citizens should be debated, the depths that should be discussed, the depths that should be discussed are not happening yet.
I hope that at every level, at every time, as much strength is given on the rights, as it is on the duties.
On two tracks of rights and duties, the vehicle of democracy of India can move forward at a rapid pace.
Tomorrow is January 30, our deity is Bapu's death date.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping it silent at 11 a.m.
As a society, as a country, on January 30, at 11 o'clock 2 minutes of tribute, it should be a comfortable nature.
Even though it may be 2 minutes, it also shows collectiveness, resolution and reverence towards martyrs.
In our country, there is a feeling of respect for the army, for the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been honored with various bravery awards.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, many categories.
When we know deeply about their courage, valour and valour, we are also surprised, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we were all happy with the news of the joy and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who are engaged in the defense of the country, received bravery due to avalanches.
I pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I keep talking about my mind continuously.
January, February, March, April - all these months are in every family, certification months.
There are one-and-a-half children in the house, but the entire family is buried in the burden of eam.
So, I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to the students friends, talk to their readers, talk to their teachers because for many years, wherever I got, the examination was a cause of a very big problem.
The family is troubled, students are troubled, teachers are troubled, a very strange psychological environment is seen in every household.
And I have always felt that I should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in detail today.
I got a telephone message from the world.
So I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
It has worked hard for a year, now there is an opportunity to tell you that this festival should be a festival of enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom there is a pleasure in the ease, the ease is a pressure for most people.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a presumption.
Those who believe in the pleasure will be able to regret the pressure.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, the best that happens within us comes out.
The strength of society is also felt at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should also be an atmosphere of festival in the entire family, between friends and neighbourhood.
You see, this business will be connected in pleasure.
Festivals will make the environment burden free.
And I urge my parents to create an atmosphere of festival for these three-four months.
The right thing is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months are tested.
It is the responsibility of all of us to transform these three-four months every year into a festival, taking our traditions and taking the environment of our family.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smiled, you are able to find yourself relaxed. And when you are relaxed, you can easily remember your years old things.
A year ago, the entire scene is remembered by the teacher in classroom.
And you must know that the power to recall the memorial is the highest in the relationship.
If you are in tension, then all the doors stop, do not go inside, do not come out.
There is a stagnation in the idea process, it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember outside, you were, nobody told it.
But who was inside, immediately came out and came out so, because you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is a medicine for recalling memories then it is a relevance.
And I tell my feelings that if there is a business then we forget our things and relax, then we can never imagine. Suddenly such things are remembered, they are very useful.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets buried down and your tension gets rid of it.
And that is why it is important that a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet and sometimes it seems that we cannot see the examination in the proper specialty.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
The ease that you are going to give is the ease of doing your studies throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
How you live, how you live, how you live, how you want to live.
In your life, there may have been opportunities to pass through several criteria, except for the tests given by classrooms and nonbooks.
And therefore, the examination has to do something with the success of life and get rid of such burdens.
They went to be admitted to the Air Force, Hail.
Assume that if he was disappointed due to that failure, lost his life then would India get such a big scientist, would not he get such a big President
The marks have become the most important.
Because of this, the competition has increased very much, along with the tension in students has also increased very much.
I would like to be aware of your ideas about this current direction of education and its future.
Although he himself has responded, but Cha wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets are a limited use of this.
It's not all that happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes on that what you have to go, have you tried to live
And what is happening to be a synergy between your mission and the mission that you have got a sense of mission and which is your sense of combition
If you trust these things, you will never need to run behind the marks while pressing the marks.
Your skills are going to work in life, self-confidence is going to work and the will power is going to work.
You should tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and all the family members will be going to them and they are a family doctor.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his journey of success.
And that is why the marks that are burdened are sometimes preventing us from going to the right direction.
But this does not mean that I say that it is not just to read.
It needs to be used for your criteria.
I was yesterday, where I am today, it's important to know him.
But if you focus on marks, you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get only marks.
It may be that despite being promising in the ease, sometimes fail in life.
Cha ji, one thing has also said that competition is done.
This is a very big psychological battle.
There is a feature of the lives of most successful players that they compete.
If we take the inauguration of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking their own record, defeating itself every time and moving forward.
He is a wonderful life journey, because he adopted a way of competition more than competitiveness.
Friends in every field of life and when you are going to give ease then if you were able to read two hours in peace, can you do three hours
That energy itself arises from within.
If you are better then you will become careless, you will be filled with great faith.
If you ruin against him, you will be sad and disappointed, you will be filled with joy, you will eat yourself and yourself and if you are equal then you will never feel the need for improvement.
Just focus on what I had done before, how would I do well.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings on the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
She further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the question of mathematics.
Once you will learn to act, the maximum problem will end.
Exception opens the way for solutions to problems.
The expectations make the road difficult.
Acknowledge the situation, give an opportunity to open new paths and therefore, make it accomplishment.
You will also be free from burden.
When a familiar person was in the hospital due to heart attack, he came to see his health before the Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP.
I was present at that time and I saw that they came and did not ask any questions regarding their health.
As soon as they sit and come, what is the situation, what is the disease, no things, started listening to jokes and in the first two to four minutes, they made such an atmosphere light.
In a way, as we go to a sick person, we scare the disease.
I would like to tell parents, sometimes we also do the same with children.
Did you ever think that in the days of Eam, there should be an atmosphere of laughing and joy to the children
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I've got a phone call of a very amazing.
They do not want to tell their name.
Listening to the phone you will know why they do not want to tell their name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell my name because I had done something like this in my childhood.
Once I had tried to duplicate in my childhood, I started making a lot of preparations for how I could duplicate and try to find out how many of my time was wasted.
In that time, I could also read the same number as I spent in making a copy of my mind.
And when I tried to pass by copying, I was also caught in it and because of me many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut roads become reasons for copying.
So Copy never benefits. To Cheat.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard again and again that don't copy, don't copy.
I'm talking to you again.
And once there was a habit of copying, there would be no desire to learn anything in life.
So where will you be
If you give the same creativity, this time you give on the issues of your eam, then perhaps there is no need for copying.
The self-confidence that will be achieved by your own hard work will be amazing.
This basic belief is wrong, it is the root of the problem.
If we have to develop inclusively, there is a life outside the books and it is very large.
This is the time to learn to live.
Someone says that I will complete all the examinations first and I will play later, then it is impossible to do this.
Have you ever thought that when all this is in front, you will come out for two moments and look at some trees and plants in the sky, you will lighten your mind, you will come back in your room with a freshness and you will come in the middle of your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a bit of breakfast, wake up and go out, go to the kitchen, find out something of your choice, get a biscuit of your choice, eat and make fun of it.
Even if you don't have five minutes, but you give break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
Whether everyone likes this or not, I do not know, but I have experience.
There is no need to stay in a room to breathe deeply.
If you come under the open sky, go to the roof, take a deep breath of five minutes and then sit down to read yourself then you will see that the body will be relevant at the same time and the relationship of your body will not only relate to the brain organs.
When I hold meetings in the elections, sometimes my voice sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours you sleep.
- Why, brother, are you a doctor
No, no, no, it is related to your voice which is bad while speaking during the election.
When you take full sleep then your vocational order will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said that now there is no need to wake up, you have to sleep.
So don't do this, otherwise the people of your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-shirts will come then you will not be able to see them.
So don't do that.
And that's why I will say that this is a very big medicine for keeping in mind the people, mind, intellect and body aware.
Well, young friends, you're in the process of exams and I'm tied up with you in mind.
Perhaps these things will also work for you.
If possible, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So as I advise the parents of your family not to become a burden, they also apply to me.
Make the criterion a festival to cross every criterion.
Then there will be no criterion, criterion.
Go ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard is keeping its place among the 4 largest Coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 airports built in the country.
While fulfilling this ideal word, the youngsters of the Coast Guard are also ready to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country in adverse circumstances.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in our country, but women are also working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder and are playing their roles in achieving success.
Our women of Coast Guard are Pilots, servers, not only this, they also take charge of overcraft.
Vidya is considered an opportunity to worship.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color De Basanti Chola - This is the inspiration.
I extend my best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious festival of Vasant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani always keeps filling with new colors with his imagination.
Since last month, he has started listening to the mind in regional languages immediately after fulfilling my mind.
It has got widespread approval.
People from far away are writing letters.
The matter of mind gives me a very big opportunity to join you.
Best wishes.
Talk of mind, December 2016
However, in newspapers, new people are being caught every day, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught. How is this possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
On the occasion of Diwali every year, I once again went to the border on the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else
It was dedicated to the soldiers of Diwali, dedicated to the security forces, in the unique manner that the country's 1. 25 billion Indians had expressed its impact on the faces of every soldiers.
They were filled with emotions and not only this, the best wishes and messages sent by the countrymen were inclusive of the security forces of the country in their joys.
And people sent only messages, not so, they were connected to the mind.
Somebody wrote poems, somebody made pictures, somebody made cartoons, somebody made videos, i.e., every house became a post like soldiers.
The work is going on, with the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country and your feelings towards the security forces of the country will be compiled in this text.
A soldier wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, Holi, Diwali is celebrated on every border, every time we are immersed in the security of the country.
Yeah, still remembers the house during the festivals.
But the truth is, this time it didn't seem.
It didn ' t seem that the festival is and I ' m not home
It feels like we are also celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that is in this Diwali, the feeling that is awakened between the security forces and the soldiers of our country, should it be limited only on some occasions
I would like to urge you to remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other, in the form of a society, in the form of a society, in the form of a nation, in the form of our nature, in any festival or festival or in the atmosphere of happiness.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times.
Some time ago, I had come to meet all the heads of the village from Jammu and Kashmir.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time
He had come here with some things about the development of his village, he had come with some demands, but when the talk started, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And with so much love, so openly, these heads of the village spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I had urged them to go and concentrate on the future of these children
Today, I am happy that all these heads who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise that they had given me.
And he awakened the people far away from the village .
Just a few days ago, when Board came to power, the sons and daughters of Kashmir participated in the examination of Board, about 95, digestive fees and students of Kashmir.
Inclusion of such a large number of students in the board examinations points out that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development through education for a bright future.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm, but I heartily congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads.
Dear Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for suggestions from the people for the matter of mind, I can say that one-sided suggestions have come.
Everyone used to say that talk more in detail on notes with 500 and 1000
By the way, addressing the nation at 8 pm on November 8, I had discussed the launch of a Mahabhiyan to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision.
And I was also supposed to have to face many new difficulties in our normal life .
And then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its effect and then we will be able to move towards the normal stage.
The campaign for liberation of diseases that we have been facing for 70 years cannot be simple
I can understand your difficulties very well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation.
Despite the efforts being made to confus you, even though sometimes you have come to the fore, you have understood this path of truth, you have accepted this thing of the country's interest.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a big country, abundance of so many currency, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the whole world is closely watching, everybody economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at whether India's 1.5 billion Indians will be able to achieve success even after facing difficulties.
Perhaps there may be questions in the mind of the world
India has only faith in 125 crore Indians, belief is that 1. 25 billion Indians will continue to fulfill their resolutions.
And our country will emerge in every way like gold and its cause is the citizen of this country. You are the reason for this and the path of this success has also become possible due to you.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank-friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all these people are working very calmly as a sacrifice of the country-service and assuming an effort to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, it doesn't even know, but all are
And the reason for this is that India will succeed in it, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, post office are working in the midst of such difficulties.
And when the issue of humanity comes, they see two steps ahead.
Someone told me that an old man was activated in Khandwa
Suddenly the money was needed
I am glad to know that they went to their homes and the elderly to get the money so that they could help in the treatment.
Such innumerable stories come out every day in television, media, newspapers, conversations.
Their powers were introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken the challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion people, the collective manhood of all, will make this nation a new power.
But evils are spread so much that there is no habit of evil in some people even today .
Some people still feel that these money of corruption, these black money, these unacceptable money, these anonymous money, finding any way and bringing it back to the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Indeed , they liked to choose a way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, talking about greed or temptation, putting money in their accounts or doing any work from them.
But, by compassion, do not play with the lives of the poor
You don't do anything that comes to the name of the poor on the record and afterwards when it is checked, my dear poor people get stuck in trouble due to your sin.
And the law of Anonymous property is made so hard that it is being implemented, how difficult it will come.
And the government doesn ' t want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Any Sriman Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has telephoneed me against corruption and black money through this five hundred and thousand: -Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Merry.
I am a common citizen of village Tirali, tehsil Tirali, district Harda, Madhya Pradesh
It's very commendable that the currency that you have closed thousand-five hundred notes.
Similarly, I have received a phone from Sriman Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: -Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you with my heart because you had said that good days will come, but nobody thought you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all these, teaching lessons to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never come better than this.
I would like to thank you for this
Some things are known through media, through government sources, the enthusiasm to work also increases.
It is so happy that it is so proud that what is the wonderful potential of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass through there, they also return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, including service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is also marriage
I came to know that on 17th November, in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter came to Surat in her marriage, only gave tea to those who did not drink and did not drink any water, no food program, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baratis also considered him the same respect
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - The contribution that he has contributed in this fight against corruption, black money, through his marriage is inspiring in itself.
I also bless the newly-married Bharat and the efficiency and convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for changing the occasion of marriage into this great sacrifice.
Tea workers live and tea workers get weekly money.
Now the notes of 2000 rupees were found, what did they do
The women of four neighbours gathered and all four went together and paid notes of 2000 rupees, so they did not need a small currency because the four bought together and decided that they would get the next week, then we will take account of it.
People are looking for ways themselves
See how the life of the village is also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefits from this campaign
The country will get the benefits in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipability comes 50 of the tapes hardly .
But this time all people ran to deposit their old notes due to the 8th decision .
In 47 urban units this year, a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees came.
You will be surprised to know that they have deposited 13 thousand crore rupees in this week.
Said three to three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front
Now this money has come 4 times in those municipality, it is natural that the poor settlements will have gutters, water will be arranged, Anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples in which its direct benefits are also visible .
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong axis of our economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, in the midst of difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to especially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the statistics of sowing this crop
I was happy, whether wheat, pulses or oilseeds, I had accounts till 20th of November, a lot of sowing has increased in comparison to last year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has discovered ways.
The government has also made several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Even after that there are difficulties, but I am confident that the farmers who are suffering from every difficulty and natural complications, they are always standing steadfastly at this time.
Small traders of our country, they also give employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions of crores of rupees have been given to such small people with the Mudra Yojana, because these small businesses, millions of people do and speed up the business of billions and billions of rupees.
But because of this decision , it was natural for them to have difficulty .
But I have seen that now our small traders are also doing this on the basis of belief that through the mobile app, through the credit card, the customers are serving the customers in their own ways.
And I want to tell my young business brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You should also download the app of banks on your mobile phone
You also keep PSL machines for credit cards
I invite you that you can contribute immensely to making cash society, you can create a complete banking system on your business, mobile phones and today there are many ways other than notes that we can run business.
Technological ways, see, security and quick
I would like you to help just succeed this campaign, not only that you also lead changes and I believe you can lead the change.
I want to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
There's a page on paper and when it's given in hand, then it's the second.
Sometimes the labour gets completed, somebody stands outside, he has to pay a cut and forced to make this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want you to have an account in your bank, the money of your Lord should be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once you have received money in your bank account, you don't even need a small mobile phone, nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-bootway - you can also pay the money from the same mobile phone which you want to buy in the small neighbourhood shop.
Therefore, I urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become participants in this scheme, because finally I have taken such a big decision for the poor, for the farmer, for the labourer, for the deprived, for the victim.
Today I want to talk to young friends especially
We say in the world that India is a country that has 65 population, less than 35 years of age.
You young and young people of my country, I know, my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I know that you also contribute a lot to this thing positively .
But friends, you're my true soldier, you're my true partner
A wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati has come to us to take the country to economic heights.
My youngsters, can you help me
You're not gonna talk to me so much
The older generation does not have the experience of today's world as you have.
Perhaps the elder brother will not even know in your family and parents, uncle and uncle may not even know.
You know what is the app, you know what is the online banking, you know how the online ticket booking happens.
The things are very common for you and you use it too .
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream is cash society.
It is okay that 100 percent cash society is not possible.
And I want your physical help in it, the time of myself, the resolution of yourself and you will never disappoint me, I am confident that because we are all those who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know, how many opportunities are there today for cash society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Each bank provides online facility
Wallet's direct meaning e-butuva
Several types of cards are available
Eature phones that are simple can also be a cash transer.
Whether it is a washer, a seller of vegetables, a seller of milk, a seller of newspapers, a seller of tea, a seller of gram, everyone can easily use it.
And I have also stressed to simplify this system .
All the banks are engaged on this, are doing it
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work.
The kind of creative message you give on the WhatsApp - Slogan, poems, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and jokes - I see everything and the creation of our younger generation between the challenges, it seems as if it is the feature of the land of India that the Gita was born in the battlefield in some era.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I want your help in this work.
Ji-ji, I repeat, I want your help and you, I am confident that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business .
You voluntarily have to lead the campaign to bring out the casualties of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to liberate people from black money, the campaign to liberate people from difficulties and problems.
Once you will teach people how to use the Rupay card, the poor will bless you.
If these arrangements are taught to the common citizen, then he will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India take this task, I don't believe it will take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand in the form of a new modern Hindustan in the world and you can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses every day and add 10 houses to it everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again ask you to move forward this campaign with great urge.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead with the campaign of cleanliness.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in his rugs and only then he remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
Soil body, mind of fun, life for a moment, introduction to me, his son, Shriman Amitabh ji, whose rings are running a mission of cleanliness, he has written to me that using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, my introduction.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji.
I also thank Shriman Amitabh ji for this kind of connectivity in the matter of mind and for pursuing the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, your letters, your messages, your letters, your messages and your messages, keep me connected to the Narendra ModiApp.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages, it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to all of you on Deepawali.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is a country where 365 days, in every corner of the country, some or the other festivals are seen.
Those who see from far-off places will feel that this is the second name of the festival, and this is also natural.
We have seen the tradition of festivals that have been in India since the Vedas till date, which have been changing from time to time. We have seen the courage to end the traditions of the festivals of the period and the changes in the festivals as per the demand of time and society have been easily accepted.
But we can see one thing well that this entire journey of the festivals of India, its depths, its penetration in the people, its penetration is connected to a original mantra and taking ourselves towards accomplishment.
Efforts should be made to expand the scope of your limited thinking, from society to universe and through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have integrated into the festival in a very scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the development.
Nature-destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India has been going to rites from the child to every person that makes the tradition, nature-love strong.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds and obligations for everyone are being celebrated.
Nowadays, we celebrate a holiday on Sunday, but we must have seen that we had traditions for centuries to celebrate a holiday on full moon and amavasya.
That is, even our holidays had developed the tradition of celebrating with the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is a teaching person, comes with the sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya - from dark to light.
By burning the Deepawali, the blind shadow of the society, the blind person, the blind shadow, the blind shadow of the person, and the same is the festival of lighting the Diwali.
We all know that go to any corner of the country, go to the house of Amir-Se-Amir, go to the hut of the poor and in the festival of Diwali, the campaign of cleanliness is going on in every family.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have their utensils of soil, then the utensils of soil also make it clear as if it has come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
However, the need of the hour is not just cleanliness in the house, cleanliness of the entire premises, cleanliness of the entire village, we have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali, the Parliament and its rulers.
He has placed a picture on infrastructure and has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what's the picture
16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and these photographs have become viral.
And all this has been done for Diwali.
Now the Prime Minister of New ealand had come, he said to me that I have to go back so soon that I am going to attend the Diwali celebrations.
I mean to say that this festival of Deepawali is becoming a festival of inspiration to bring the world community from darkness to light.
By collecting many firecrackers, they invite a very big accident in an attempt to make a big voice of tax.
Never keeps in mind what things are around, there will be no fire.
In the days of Deepawali, news of sudden news, news of fire, news of immortality, big concerns.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, a large number of doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with their family, then there is a crisis in the crisis.
It's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Puja, brother Duj, say Benefits Panchami, and take Kartik Purnima to the light festival, then there is a long period.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
In the eastern region of India, the festival of Chhath-Puja is a very big festival.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but there is a feature that gives a big message to the society.
But the saying is that Bhai, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you, but at the same time there is a time for me, especially thanks to the people of the country.
Our Army personnel have been looting everything for our comfort for the last few months, the events that are taking shape.
My emotions are shadowed by the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penance, hard work and my heart.
And one of the same thing was done in the mind that it was dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign from Sandesh to Solidiers.
But today I want to say that there will be no human being in India who has an unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country, the pride of the army, the pride of the security forces.
The manner in which it has been expressed, it is empowering every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, so encouraging, your message has emerged as power.
Whether it is a school or a college, a student or a village, a poor, a businessman, a shopkeeper, a politician, a sportsperson or a cinematographer, hardly anybody who has not burnt it for the soldiers of the country, has not given a message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also overturned this Deepotsav on the occasion of expressing gratitude to the army and why not, whether it is BS or RP or IDF.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water Services, Army, Nubha-Servicemen, Coast Guard, I cannot say innumerable names.
When we are in the mood of the festival, when we remember it then there is a new strength in that memory.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Solidiers have come up with all such things on this path in a symbolic manner.
I have sent a poem to Shriman Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read him.
Ashwini ji has written: I celebrate the festival, smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, smile, this is all because you are, I tell you today, because you are the cause of my independence, I sleep peacefully because you are posted on the border, smile on the mountain and the chest of India bows down to you, in the same way the army of India is mine.
My dear countrymen, whose maternal uncle is full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also full of army personnel, a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, let us hear what the Fauji family says: - Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Solidiers campaign on this Deepawali is encouraging our Fauji brothers.
I'm from an army family.
My husband is also an Army Officer.
My mother and mother-in-law have been both army officers.
So, we are full of family members and we have many such officers on the border who are getting so good messages and are getting a lot of incentives in the Army Circle.
And I would like to say that their families and their wives along with Army Officers and Solidiers are also doing a lot of education.
Thank you, my dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing not only on the border but on every front of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was freed from open defecation.
Earlier Sikkim was a province, now Himachal has also happened, Kerala is also going to be on 1st November.
TBP jawan, Shri Vikas Thakur, is basically from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village, he was probably going to be a village house at that time, he reached there and was being discussed in the meeting of the village and it was found that some families were unable to make toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is our patriotism.
And that is why Himachal Pradesh has the power to free the open ease.
In Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I am aware that there is no way in the far-flung forests of Kerala, it is difficult to reach the village hardly after walking throughout the day. Such a tribal panchayat is Idmalakudi.
People never go.
In his sight, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to the notice that this village had to make toilets.
People of NSS, students of engineering, all decided together that we will build toilets.
The goods that were to be taken to make toilets, be it bricks, cements, all these commodities were lifted on their shoulders and went on foot in those forests throughout the day.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken over this work, the entire state, I am confident that soon it will become kerosene free.
The big changes will come, theft will also stop, the benefits of the environment will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, if there's trouble, the middlemen will be, the dishonest will be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything that should be said to the country even today, how to go, sets standards for this.
Based on this standard you decide.
The need of the hour is that now we have to address the impressions of the poor of the country.
To get rid of troubles, we have to take one step after another.
Whatever our old thinking is, the society has to be freed from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are tools for girls in schools and tools for children.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel a discriminatory India.
There is a vaccination on behalf of the government, but even then lakhs of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of diseases.
A campaign of Mission Indradhanush vaccination which has also empowered children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, after cooking food on the wooden stove, take 400 cigarettes of smoke in the day, what will happen to his health
Efforts are being made to provide smoke-free life to 5 crore households and are moving towards success.
The small trader, the small businessman, the seller, the seller of the vegetables, the seller of the milk, the runner of the nai shop, the moneylenders used to be so furious in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan-Dhan account, this is a successful campaign for free from interests.
To deposit directly in banks through Aadhaar, the entitled, the beneficiary gets direct money.
This is an opportunity to get rid of intermediaries in the lives of common man.
There is a campaign in which there is no improvement and change, the way to get rid of the problem is going on and is happening.
My dear countrymen, yesterday, October 31, the great man of this country, the unity of India, who made the mantra of his life, showed that such a festival is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman of Punjab, his pain touched me: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know that on 31st, Sardar Patel ji's birth anniversary is.
And as we all know how events have occurred in the country after their murder.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we prevent such unfortunate events and events
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
One Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, Bhagirath work to unite the country was done by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring free India under a flag, such a great Bhagirath work done by the great man, bowing down to that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lives for unity, due to his priority of unity struggling for unity, many were also victims of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, an injustice to Sardars, a page of history suffers from all of us.
But in the midst of these crisis, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the power of this country.
We should also avoid scattered thinking, scattering tendencies and save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us a India, it is the responsibility of all of us to make a better India.
The fundamental mantra of unity makes the foundation of a strong India.
The journey of Sardar Saheb started with the struggle of farmers.
The farmer's son was.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in reaching the freedom movement to the farmers.
Sardar Saheb's successful effort was to make the movement of freedom a empowerment in the village and his organization was the result of power and skills.
But Sardar Saheb was not just a person of conflict, but he was also a person of the structure.
Today, we sometimes listen to the name of Amul.
Today people are also familiar with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he had imagined the Union of Cooperative Milk Producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festival in the series of these Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev, his educational initiation is still a guide for the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and truth, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the basic mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
Be it discriminatory, superstitions, misdeeds, the campaign to liberate the society was in every case of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were at the peak of the spectacles, castes and creeds, its deformity, Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his colleague.
Come, let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, inspires us to leave discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, if we have to move forward with this mantra then who can be our best guide from Guru Nanak Dev.
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali.
Your dreams, your resolves are successful in every way.
I extend my best wishes to all of you that your life becomes a living creature of happiness.
Thanks a lot.
In the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I will tell the people of the country so much and I would like to repeat the same day that the guilty will continue to be punished.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We're denial of our army.
I want to talk specially to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started understanding the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and walked on the path of peace.
Every parents want to work completely at the earliest.
The farmers are also feeling that the fruits and fruits that have been prepared should reach the market all over India.
Economic business also run properly.
And for the last few days, the business has started running smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are also the path of solution to our problems, our progress is also the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem together, find ways and also provide better ways for the future generation of Kashmir.
Security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of governance.
The government has to take some steps to make law and order.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think.
I get the opportunity to know a lot in social media these days.
Every corner of India gets an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it boosts the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of class 11 had a different kind of idea in front of me.
He has written that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very distracted.
But there was no way to do, and what can a small student like me do
So I came to my mind how I should also work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I would study more than 3 hours a day.
I can work for the country, I will become such a qualified citizen.
It is a matter of satisfaction for me, brother Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age in this atmosphere of resentment.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that there is a huge value of the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very good manner.
And he inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan mantra.
There is another way to demonstrate patriotism between the voices of bombs and drops, it was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the freedom movement, when the movement was intensified and there was a need for a halt in the movement, he used to use the intensity of the movement to inspire the creative work inside the society.
We all have the responsibility of the army, the people sitting in the government will perform their duties and with the responsibility of our countrymen, every citizen and patriotism, if we contribute to some creative contribution then the country will certainly cross new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on the Narendra ModiApp that the events that had gone to Paralleympics created history and their performance was the victory of the Human Spirit.
Shriman Varun Viswanathan also wrote on Narendra ModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in the matter of mind.
Not only two of you, every person in the country has become an emotional attachment to our sportspersons in paralleympics.
Perhaps this paralleympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the attitude of humanity and the attitude of looking at the Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability.
This sentence has a great power.
This time, 19 students, including 3 women from our country, participated in Paralleympics.
When Divyang plays in comparison to the rest of the sports, the physical capability, the skills of the sports, this is also the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals, including 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medals, so far.
Bhai Devendra Jhazariya, who received the Gold Medal, brought the Gold Medal again and brought it back after 12 years.
And they were not divyang from birth.
He had to lose one hand due to the power crisis.
You think that those people who get the first gold medal at the age of 23 and get the second gold medal at the age of 35, they have done so much in their lives.
Mariappan won the gold medal in Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
The poor did not even come under their resolution.
They are not from the big city, nor from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, he gave medals to the country with the capability of resolution.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, many types of winners have been associated with their name.
Varun C. Bhati got bronze medal in high jump.
These medals have done a great job to look at the medals of paralleympics, in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our divine brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities have been awakened, but the perspective of looking at these people has also changed.
Very few people will know how these disabled people have empowered this time in paralleympics.
Just a few days ago, there was a limpic competition at the same place.
Someone can think that the record of General Limpics was brake and broken by the Divyang people.
This time has happened.
Abdellati Baka of Algeria made a new record in the last one-and-a-half seconds, in a 1500 meter race, from the record made by the recipient of the Gold Medal in the 1500 meter race.
Moreover, I was surprised that the fourth number of Divyangjans, who had not received any medals, had run in less than those who had received gold medals in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these players and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for paralleympics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week, I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He also told me some part, and he presented me there, in front of the people, people were surprised.
On that day I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and collect successful stories of the lives of some people with disabilities.
There were big inspirational incidents.
The Government of India recorded the world on the earth of Navsari, which I consider as important.
Within eight hours, six-seven Divyangjans who could not hear, successfully used to eat machines to listen to them.
He got the place in the Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for us to have three-three World Records by Divyangs in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of worshipped Bapu.
And on that day, I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should become a duty, every citizen should become an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt.
Now when two years are happening on October 2, I can say with confidence that the awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everyone has tried to move one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved towards cleanliness, 1. 25 billion steps.
It has also been confirmed, how good the direction is, how good the fruits are, what is happening from a little effort and that is why everybody, whether it is a common citizen or a ruler, whether it is a government office or a road or a bus stand or a railway, whether it is a school or a college or a religious place or a hospital, from children to old, the village is contributing to cleanliness.
Media friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, efforts have been fulfilled and we will succeed, this belief has also emerged.
It is also important to talk about rural India, so far about two and a half million toilets have been constructed and one and a half crore more toilets are intended in the coming year.
When I went to Gujarat, the officers told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations to those who have done this thing and those who are trying to do it and I urge the countrymen to take a pledge to move ahead with this problem for respect to mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
In particular, I want to present a plan for young friends who use technology a lot nowadays.
The government of India has given a telephone number to everybody and for this, 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
This number 1969 - You will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city by telephone but also apply for making toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor those young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent in the form of Swachh Bharat Ellows within the districts.
This cleanliness campaign does not matter even if it is limited to rites.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, health is connected with sanitation, along with sanitation, revenue models are also essential.
It is also important to be a part of health and therefore, we have to move forward towards the cleanliness mission as well as towards east to competition.
The artificial companies have been asked to buy the job that is ready from waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should be provided this.
Those who want to improve the health of the earth, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical ertilizers, if they need such fertilizers in some quantity then they should provide them.
And Shriman Amitabh Bachchan is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors of Metropolitan cities and commissioners from all over the country are going to concentrate on this and only cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in it
All topics are going to be discussed.
And I am seeing that new news comes continuously for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University launched a campaign to build toilets in 107 villages.
He himself laboured and contributed to making about 9 thousand toilets.
You must have seen that in the past, a team led by England Commander Paramveer Singh swimming a journey of 2800 km from Devprayag to Gangasagar in Ganga and conveyed a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made its own departments a calendar for a year.
Every department works specially on cleanliness for 15 days.
In the coming October from 1st to 15th October, all three of them are going to work together by making a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of October, 16th October to 31st October, 3rd and the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing I.
My citizens are also requested that if you have any connection with the work done by these departments then you should also join.
You must have seen that these days the care campaign of cleanliness is also going on.
Once before the survey of 73 cities, the situation of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of about 500 cities with a population of more than 1 lakh people and because of this there is a belief within every city that we are left behind, now the next time we will do something good.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all the citizens can contribute to this campaign.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is taking two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I have been urging you to buy something from Khadi.
This time also I urge that every family should have something of khadi so that the house of the poor can burn the Diwali.
On October 2, while Sunday is a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
2 hours, 4 hours physically connect yourself to the sanitation work and I tell you that you should share a photograph of the sanitation mission that you are involved in.
If there is a video, then share a video.
See, the efforts of the people across the country will once again get a new strength and a new momentum.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, it is a pleasure to give it to yourself.
It is his campaign to collect food items and clothes to the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and used to donate the old toys and the toys that used to come to the poor settlement used to present in the Anganwadi.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to those youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, this is the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji's birth anniversary and from today the centenary year of his birth is going on.
This is his contribution, the theory of Sabjan Hitay-Government Sukhai Antyodaya.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last end person.
How do the poor get the fruit of development
He presented the entire economic agenda to every field in two words.
The country celebrates his birth centenary year as a poor welfare year.
We can get rid of the poverty by going to the society, the attention of the governments, the benefits of development and the benefits of development.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of that century.
I salute the inspirational man and the rich devotee of our ideological heritage, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji.
My dear countrymen, I had started talking about Mann Ki Baat 2 years ago on Vijayadashmi.
It was my honest effort that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to commemorate government work.
How does the common man of this country inspire me
What are the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way you salute Mann Ki Baat and blessed me this week.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he not only disseminated these things but also tried his best to reach it in all languages.
I am also grateful to the people of those countries who have written letters after Mann Ki Baat, suggested and highlighted the shortcomings of the government and Akashwani provided platforms for solving problems by inviting the people of the government by making special programmes on such letters.
So the talk of Mann Ki Baat was not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but it became a new opportunity for social transformation.
What can be the cause of satisfaction for anyone and that is why I express my gratitude to everyone associated with making it successful.
My dear countrymen, next week, the festival of Navaratri and Durga-Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different atmosphere happens in the entire country.
This is a festival of power and supremacy, the unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navaratri or Durga Puja, how will this worship of Shakti be the festival of worship of unity of society
How are the festivals connecting people
And that is the fulfilment of true power and only then can we celebrate the victory of tax.
Let us seek the power, let us take the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Hockey magician Dhyan Chand ji on August 29.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I also want to remind you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India the Gold Medal of Hockey Hockey in Limpic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked for Dhyan Chand ji, he was a living example of patriotism and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, a opposition player hit the head of Dhyan Chand ji.
At that time the match was just 10 minutes left to end.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of the injury with the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes, there are several suggestions on MyGov or Narendra ModiApp.
I am looking at the common citizens so much attachment to the Rio Limpics, so awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to speak something on this.
Even outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, there is so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this also became a cause of inspiration in itself.
One Shriman Ajit Singh has written on Narendra ModiApp, Please talk about the education of daughters and their participation in sports, because he has honoured the country by winning medals in Rio Limpics.
Someone writes Shriman Sachin that you are requested to mention the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time.
The medals we get, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems, the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
On MyGov, Summit Thakur has written that we could have improved the limpics.
He has written, Honourable Modi, first of all, congratulates for the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention on whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to set a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize on studying and education.
The game is still considered to be the waste of time in the society.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And nobody can do this work properly.
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the Narendra ModiApp that there is a need to focus on etra-curriculture activities in Mann Ki Baat, especially children and youth with sports.
In a way, thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be ruled out that we can not perform according to our hope.
In some cases, those who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in the sports here could not reach there, and only two medals were found in the medal table.
But it is also true that despite not getting the medal, if you look at it carefully, for the first time in many subjects, the players of India have shown a lot of good work.
Now look, in the shooting, our innovative Bindra ji was in the fourth place and he had lost medals from a very short distance.
Deepa Karmakar also wondered at the Gymnastic - he was at the fourth place and lost medal due to a very short distance.
But how can we forget this thing that he is the first Indian daughter to ualify for Limpics and Limpic Winal.
Something similar happened in Tennis with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna's pair.
We performed well this time in Athletics.
After PT Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar made qualifications for track fields.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years, the women hockey team reached Limpic.
Developing in boating Krishna Yadav reached the quarter-inal, but could not get brown.
Many players, such as - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performances are good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do the same, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Government of India will go into its depths and will study what is happening in the world.
We will make a roadmap of what we can do.
2020, 2024, 2028 - We have to plan with a far-reaching thinking.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and what can we do within the sports world, what can one of our states do, the state likes one game, two sports.
And I urge every citizen in India to send suggestions on the Narendra Modi App for whoever is interested in it.
Write to the government, discuss the society and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, 5th September is a Teacher's Day.
I also learned a lot from these small boys.
For me, 5th September was also a Teacher Day and for me, Education Day was also there.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 summit, then I realized that today I will express my feelings in the matter of mind.
The more mother's place in life, the less teacher's place.
And we have seen such teachers who have more concerns than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio Limpic, Pullela Gopichand ji is discussed all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what happens to a good teacher.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher from a player.
And on Teacher's Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication towards sports and his ways to enjoy the success of my students.
The contribution of the teacher in the lives of all of us is always felt.
5th September is the birth anniversary of former President of India, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates him as Teachers Day.
He reached any place in his life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think that I remember so much of my teachers because they used to be our heroes in our small villages.
But today I can say that one of my teachers is now 90 years old - even today I have a letter from them every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised that he writes with so many beautiful letters in this stage and because of this, whenever I see a good letter of myself, I am very much honoured.
You should be on the Narendra ModiApp, a photograph with your teacher, an incident with your teacher, an inspirational thing of your teacher, you must share it.
See, it is also very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country in the eyes of students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is an arrogant and we all want our country, our society, our family, our every person, his life to be incomplete.
But when Ganesh speaks of the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of Rashtriya Jagran and made a festival of social rites.
And, through the public Ganesh Festival, there should be a massive discussion on the questions touching society and life and the creation of programmes should be such that the society gets a new light and a new momentum.
Even today, public Ganesh Festivals have started in every corner of India not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
All the youngsters also make a lot of preparations to do this, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still made a lot of efforts to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
They have discussions on public topics, essay competitions, colorful competitions.
He also highlights the issues that touch the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through public Ganesh Festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth-literate right.
Suraj is our priority, can we not address the public Ganesh Festival about this mantra
Come on, let me invite you.
It is true that the festival is the power of society.
Festival fills a new life in the life of the person and society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but it has to be moved as per the demand of time.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot on those things, especially Ganesha Festival and Durga Puja.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has made Shriman Shankar Narayan Prashant, he has said with great urge that Modi ji, you should explain to the people in the matter of Mann Ki Baat that do not use the statues of Ganesh ji made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of the pond of the village
The statues made of POP are not favorable to the environment.
They have expressed great pain, others have also done it.
I pray to all of you, why don't we come back to the old tradition of Ganesh idols and statues of Durga using soil
Defence of the environment, the protection of our rivers and ponds, the protection of small organisms of this water from pollution in it is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a miserable person.
So we should not make Ganesh ji who creates a break.
I don't know how you will take these things.
Many such institutions and individuals work very hard for Ganesh of soil and also campaign.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav - this is also a social service.
Durga Puja is now time.
Now we decide that the idols that our old families used to build will also get employment and the ponds or rivers will be made of soil, then they will be able to get it again and then the environment will also be protected.
I extend my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be decorated with the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had put her entire life for the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who served the poor in India for a lifetime, gets the title of a saint.
The event that will be held on 4th September will also send an official delegation led by the Government of India and our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1.
From saints, sages, sages and great men, we get to learn something or the other every moment.
We will continue to get something, learn something and will continue to do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, how big change comes.
Manpower is considered to be the form of God.
The Government of India, in collaboration with 5 State Governments, has made a successful effort to connect the people for clean Ganga and for clean Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, those people were invited to Allahabad that they were heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women too.
He came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of Ganga coast took oath in the testimony of Mother Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of going to open defecation in their villages on the banks of the Ganges, run a campaign to make toilets and contribute to the cleanliness of the Ganges. The village will not let the Ganges be dirty.
I congratulate these chiefs for coming to Allahabad for this resolution, some came from Uttarakhand, some came from Uttar Pradesh, some came from Bihar, some came from Jharkhand, some from West Bengal and I congratulate them all for this work.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and congratulate the Ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a crucial step in the sanitation of Ganga by connecting the manpower.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch me a lot and I have a special respect for those who have imagined it.
On July 15, more than seventeen lakh students of more than seventeen and a half schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, somebody wrote in Hindi, somebody wrote in Chhattisgarh, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children of seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it was so impressive that whenever the school came after receiving the letter, the parents had grabbed a letter to the teacher and the parents had promised that they would make a toilet by the date of functioning.
Congratulations to those who made this effort and also congratulated those students and those parents who decided to work towards making a toilet by taking the letter of their child seriously.
This is what inspires us.
In the Koppal district of Karnataka, a daughter of sixteen years old Mallamma, this daughter satyagraha against her family.
It is said that he had left the meal and that too was not to ask for anything for himself, not to bring good clothes, not to eat sweets, but toilet in our house.
Now there was no economic situation of the family, the daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her Satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma has done satyagraha for Toilet, then see the features of the village's chief Mohammad Shafi as well as the eighteen thousand rupees and made a toilet within a week.
Look at the ability of this daughter Mallamma and see the heads of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How are the ways to solve the problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a resolution.
Some Indians have made it their own.
But everyone is connected to it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
It will be competitive and the winners on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make films from your mobile phone.
Come on, move forward, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbors, our relationships are easier and our relations are alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President, Honourable Pranab Mukherjee, launched a new programme in Kolkata, Akashwani Matri Channel.
Now many people will feel whether the President should also inaugurate a radio honeyl
But this is not a normal radio channel, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here Akashwani friends and Bangladesh Betars, they will share contacts and Bengali people will enjoy Akashwani on both sides.
Akashwani has a very big contribution from people to people contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for their involvement in this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of Prime Minister, but finally I am a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me too much.
Such emotional events also give new energy, give new inspiration and this is what inspires the people of India to pass something or the other.
In the past, I got a letter, touched my mind.
Nearly 84-year-old mother who is a retired teacher wrote this letter to me.
If he had never forbidden me to declare my name in his letter, then I had a mind that today I will talk to you by giving my name and he wrote that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy then I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padmashree.
Friends, You will be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives will go to Ruburu and give them a letter.
I am trying to write a letter to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter reached this mother and he wrote to me that you are doing good work.
Your campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher, in a few years I will be 90 years old, I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50 thousand so that you can work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine that as a normal teacher, the mother who passes a retarded pension, gives 50 thousand rupees and to free poor mothers and sisters from the smoke of stove and to provide gas connections.
The question is not about 50 thousand rupees, the question is of that mother's spirit and such a number of mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes me trust and strength for the future of the country.
And he did not write me as the Prime Minister. He wrote a letter directly - Modi Bhaiya
I salute that mother and I also salute these mothers of India who always do some good by suffering their own sufferings.
My dear countrymen, we were upset because of the famine last year, but this month of August was constantly filled with floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central government, the local Swaraj institutions, the social institutions and citizens have made their best efforts to do whatever they can.
But even among the news of these floods, there were some news that had to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can it get
It will be remembered this year's August month.
In August 2016, there were a lot of parties in the Parliament, all the parties passed the legislation of GST in collaboration with the parties who had a horrific political opposition, those who did not leave any chance against each other.
Its credit goes to all parties.
This is an example of how big work is being done by all the parties in one direction.
In the same way, whatever happened in Kashmir, in relation to the situation of that Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together spoke of Kashmir with a tone.
He also gave a message to the world, also gave a message to separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all have the opinion of 1. 25 billion Indians, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister that if anybody knows about Kashmir, whether it belongs to a young man or a security personnel, it is our own loss, it belongs to our own country.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they have to answer these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
Being a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility to empower, expose and make the country a bright future by going.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 billion Indians.
Today, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of the sports will paint every young man in the country.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest games are going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to repeat in our ears.
Our hopes are very much, but the work of encouraging those players and their zeal in Rio is also for 1. 25 billion people.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a very good event for run for rio, sports and lives, sports and plays.
In the coming days, wherever we are, do something to encourage our players.
No matter how much fond of eating, everything has to be left.
I am ready to do this work on behalf of you.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovation, the stagnant water spreads dirt and technology becomes a burden.
And if we continue to win the trust of old technologies without research and innovation, then we will be out of the world in the changing era and that is why the government has taken several steps towards research and innovation towards science in the new generation.
And that's why I say - Let us take to innovation and when I tell you we are to be innovative, then my AI.
If we have to prepare the next generation innovators, then our children will have to be linked to them and that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Abs.
Wherever there will be such tinkering pockets in schools, they will be given Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will also be given for maintenance during five years.
If we have strong and prosperous incubation centres then we have a system for innovation, for start-ups, to bring it to a position.
In the same way, India is struggling with many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technical solutions.
We have called upon the younger generation of the country to find out the way for solutions, research and innovation.
The Government of India wants to promote the discovered technology to solve our problems by giving special prizes.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worrying about famine and these days the joy of rain is also coming and news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to help flood affected people.
In spite of some difficulties due to rain, every mind and every human mind gets thrilled because there is rain in the center of our entire economic activity, farming.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we remain regretted for life.
Angue can be avoided.
Keep in mind the slightest cleanliness, be cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and not the thought that such a disease occurs in the poor settlement is not the case of engagement.
Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on T. but sometimes we are somewhat unhappy about the awareness action.
The government, the hospital, the doctors, they will do their jobs, but I would like to pray to you that we should not enter our houses, in our area, in our family and there should not be any disease due to water.
I want to attract your attention towards another trouble, dear countrymen.
Life has become so sympathetic that sometimes we do not have time to think for ourselves.
If you have become sick, then you can recover quickly and that's why you put any antibiotic in the body.
Immediately the disease gets rid of the disease, but my dear countrymen, the habit of taking antibiotics can create a very serious crisis.
You may get relief for a few moments, but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked to take.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are rapidly bringing about such changes that medicines have no effect.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical language and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When it comes to health, I want to add one more thing.
Sometimes the concern of the lives of mothers who are in our country during pregnancy is very high.
Every year about 3 crore women are pregnant in our country, but some mothers die during delivery, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children die, sometimes both children and mothers die.
It is fine that in the last decade, the rate of untimely death of mother has come down, but still a large number of pregnant mothers can not save their lives.
During pregnancy or after the deficiency of blood, infections related to delivery, high BP-When the problem will destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Safe Maternity Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I am sure that you cannot provide these services free of cost for poor mothers on 9th day in a month.
Can my doctors brothers and sisters not apply for this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
I'm sure you must join.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is collectively discussed in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree in the battlefield, worrying about how much its importance will be, we can guess.
In the Gita Lord Krishna says - Ashwath: Sarvakshana i.e. I am peepal in all trees.
Thanks to the policy - Nasti original medicines - there is no plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
The one who donates the tree gives wire to the tree like a child in the world.
Therefore, parents who want their welfare plant good trees and follow their children.
Our Shastra-Geeta, Thanksgiving policy, Mahabharata's discipline festival, but there are also some people in today's generation who show these ideals.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came in my mind, it touched my mind.
In the discipline festival of Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world and Sonal has taken the lead not only to his parents but to fulfill the wishes of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, he married his grandson Sonal in a big inspirational way.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
The idea that Sonal himself is a agricultural graduate came to him and to give mango plants in marriage, see how excellent nature's love has emerged.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of nature love and I extend my best wishes to Sonal and Mr.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the temple of Amba ji in Bhadra month. Once a social worker organisation decided that those who will come to the temple will give them plants in Prasad and tell them that this is the offering of mother ji, this plant will become bigger in their villages and mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell Kisan brothers that if we waste our land on the banks of our farms, why should we not cultivate timber instead of that fence
Today, India has to bring billions of dollars of timber from abroad to build a house and to build a tournament.
If we plant trees on the edge of our farm, which work for unity and home, then after fifteen-twenty years, we can also sell it with the government's permission and they can become a new source of income and also avoid importing timber to India.
In the past, many states have launched a lot of campaigns using this season, the Government of India has also passed an AMPA law, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to go to plantation.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half crore plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore plants.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert-Bhoomi - such a big forest festival and has resolved to plant twenty-five lakh plants.
Twenty-five lakh plants in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big it has taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percentage by Twenty-twenty-nine (2029).
There is also a very bright tradition of the One Festival in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has taken up several such projects like Amra Van, Ekta Van, Shaheed Van as One Festival and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and whenever there is a foreign journey, there is a diplomacy, there is talk of trade, there are discussions about security, there are many ways - all this is to happen.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When you remember South Africa, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Non-violence, love, forgiveness in the world - when these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited Phoeni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I also got the privilege of the journey of the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had transmitted Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell you, this time I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who had spent their youth for equality and equal opportunities for the society.
They fought with Nelson Mandela on their shoulders and lived with Nelson Mandela in jail for twenty-two and twenty-two years.
In a way, he had invited the entire youth and I had the privilege of visiting these great feelings of Shriman Ahmed Kathrada, Shriman Lalu Cheeba, George Beios, Ronie Kasrils.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they got ready to lose their lives.
On their faces, even after doing such a great penance, it was not seen anywhere.
A kind of duties - The duties that have been described in the Gita were not seen to be absolutely literate.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunities.
There can be no big mantra for any society and the government.
Equality and mother-in-law, these are the ways that lead us to a bright future.
Children want a good future.
The priority will be different but the path is the same and the path is for development, for equality, for equality, for equality, for equality, for equality and for mother-in-law.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Being a woman, I'm sorry to have her family.
And as technology is doing a big role in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
Sometimes you will be confused and they write a letter so well, as if it is a right letter.
Your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes open through technology.
This is a new way of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I understand that we should avoid this joy, be cautious and if something like this happens then we should make our friends a little aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought a good thing to me, you must have experienced, but may not have seen that much seriously, but I think there is a need to see.
My dear countrymen, if the session of Parliament is going on these days then I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The artistic paintings have been done at the station.
Not only this, they searched and collected the plastic bottles or oil cans that were lying in such wastes in the village and planted soil and planted them and made virtual gardens.
And by making these virtual gardens in plastic bottles towards the railway station, it was completely a new form.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must see the station.
Nowadays, I am receiving news from several railway stations in India and local people are presenting their area on the walls of the railway station through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of how peoples participation can be brought about.
Congratulations to all those who work in this way in the country, my colleagues of Aligarh have special congratulations.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of rain and festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples, in the puja houses and you will also be able to join the festival even outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a festival of special importance here.
Like last year, cannot you present the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of our country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
Think, give such a gift to sister, who will really protect her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in independent India.
75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence can give us new inspiration, new emotions, can become an opportunity for a resolution to do something for the country.
The entire country should be coloured with the colours of freedom fighters and feel the luxury of freedom all around.
This atmosphere should be the festival of independence - this is not a government programme, it should be the people of the country.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope that you will also do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture on the Narendra Modi App.
Make an atmosphere in the country.
Dear countrymen, on August 15, I get a good fortune to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your talk from the Red Fort with the same intensity.
I invite you and those ideas in your mind that as your representative, as your principal servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write and send me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of 1.
I invite you, let us recall the virtue of freedom fighters, recall the great men who have spent their lives for India and move ahead with the resolve to do something for the country.
All the citizens of the country are very greeted.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I am also grateful to Akashwani for their successful efforts to present this mind in regional languages at 8. 00 in the evening.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me, later through the letter, through the telephone, through MyGov website, through the Narendra Modi App, bring their feelings to me.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
This relationship with you is very useful for this thing that the government should be so active in terms of public interest and how primary the work of public interest should be.
I hope that you will surely emphasize how to run democracy with public participation by becoming more active.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is feeling the heat fire.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were decreasing, trees were cut and in a way human species only destroyed nature and paved the way for their destruction.
June 5 is the World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, there is concern.
This time, the nited nations have placed this topic on the World Environment Day, the Gero Tolerance for Fieldlife Trade.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, we have to discuss water, how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen that in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - Himalayas, the fire that took place in the forests.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - I could have done a meeting of all the drought affected states, but I did not do this.
What to say to the states, listen to them closely.
Normally, in the government, how much money was spent from the Government of India and how much was spent - it does not matter closely.
It was also surprising to the officials of our Government of India that many states have made a lot of efforts to deal with the situation of water, to deal with the situation of drought, to the animals, to the affected people and to the government of any party in every corner of the country.
In a way, it was also a learning efficiency for me and I have told my Policy Commission how to take the best practices in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra, have used a lot of technology in Gujarat.
I would like to convey the special efforts made by the NITI Aayog to the States and to the States.
Public participation is the basis of a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give a prasad and even a little prasad falls, there is distress in the mind.
They raise him and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is also wasted, then we should suffer.
And that is why water conservation is equally important and water conservation is equally important. And that is why every drop-more crop, micro-irrigation and minimum water crops.
It is a matter of great joy that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, some are using drip-irrigation, some are doing sprinklers.
When I sat with the states, some states have successfully used drip-irrigation and due to which their yields have also increased, water has also been saved and wages have also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are many states who have taken big targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a lot of work in drip-irrigation and they are trying to join two-two-three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign goes on in all the states then farming will also benefit a lot, water will also be accumulated.
The brothers of our Telangana have tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology in the Neeru Progress Mission and to improve ground water.
People are also sweating and paying money in the mass movement that Maharashtra has created.
I feel that this movement will actually help Maharashtra in protecting from the crisis of the future.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj-Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has planned Balram pond - Nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small data
Rajasthan and Gujarat have launched a big campaign to revive them as a Jal Mandir.
Rajasthan has launched Chief Minister Jal-Swamamban campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a very big campaign of Heck Dam.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have launched a campaign to stop water of ten-ten, twenty-six kilometers by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August and September should be decided and one drop of water will not be wasted.
And this is not just a matter of farmers.
This village, the poor, the labourer, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor are related to everyone and that is why the rains are coming, then the water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, please also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How is this precious treasure given to God
Media explained the problem of water in detail in the past.
I hope that the media should guide the people towards saving water, drive and make the media a partner for eternal liberation from the water crisis.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
If we have to reach many systems from one corner to the other corner of India, then our old habits will also have to change a bit.
Today, I want to touch a topic on which if you help me, then we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give so much vegetables in return.
Business used to run from the border system.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards a culture society.
We can also get money and money through electronic technology system.
You can buy things, you can also square the bill.
And this will never raise the question of stealing the bats from the wrath.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts, automatic accounts will be there.
The beginning will look a bit difficult, but once the habit will take place, this system will become simple.
And this is because we have opened bank accounts of nearly all the families of the country that have launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days.
So, we can move towards this skill society by coordinating Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM) and JAM.
You must have seen that Rupay card has been given with Jan-Han account.
In the coming days, this card is going to be used both in terms of credit and debit.
I don't need to count the money out of the zeb.
There is no need to roam together.
Whatever initiatives the Government of India has taken, how to get money through a PSU.
It will be very easy to transmission through your mobile phone and it is a matter of great happiness that NP.
In a way, the bank has worked on your door in that direction.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and add habits then we will not need this currency, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run automatically and there will be a transparency due to this.
Look, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobiles would be in every hand of us.
Gradually, it became a habit, now it can not live without it.
Perhaps this calculation society may take the same form but if it happens in less time then it will be better.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of limpics come and whenever the game starts, we sit in the sir patak, how much behind we were in the Gold Medal, the silver was not found or did not run from the brown.
Encouraging our sportspersons who are going for Rio Limpics, to encourage them, to encourage them, everybody in their own way.
Some songs, some cartoons, some good wishes, some games, but the entire country should create a very positive environment for these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a great strength in itself, when the player feels that 1. 25 billion people are standing with him, then he gets encouraged.
And these days, I have seen that an atmosphere of football has started to be seen all over the country.
Many people are making their teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Perhaps many people would not have played, but thousands of youngsters of the country are so interested in playing, it was a pleasant experience for me.
We know the attachment of cricket and India, but I have seen such an attachment to the football which indicates a very happy future in itself.
So, in the days to come, we will create an atmosphere of zeal and zeal for all our sportspersons who are eligible for love for Rio Limpics.
Everything should not be won and defeated by the test of defeat.
With the Sportsman Spirit, India has made its identity in the world.
I urge the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of zeal and zeal towards our sports partners.
New results have been coming from somewhere since last eight-ten days.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard throughout the year, have given eam, 10th, 12th, one after another.
It's clear that our daughters are showing supremacy.
It's a pleasure.
My best wishes to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to once again tell those who have not succeeded that there is a lot to do in life.
If there is no result according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
You should live with confidence, move ahead of faith.
But a new kind of question has come in front of me and I had never thought about this.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me that hey, four marks would be more, you would be 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher, no one was happy with my 89. 33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, yeah, for four marks, you were 90 percent.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is that all in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I also get a little less
I don't know, I feel a burden on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I think that perhaps this pain will not only be of you, but also of millions and millions of students like you, because it has become an atmosphere to discover dissatisfaction with it rather than satisfaction. This is another form of negativeness.
We can never take society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction among all things.
Your family, your friends and friends would have praised your 89. 33 percent and you would have decided to do more.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost in the same way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poetry but I had read a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the envas of life.
Oh, I wish, any one-and-a-half spectator had also flown tears on the picture of this pain.
These were the words of poetry, I have not remembered it anymore, but if there is a poem a long time ago, but the feeling was the same.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, listen, but stay on your point and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what has been found, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of big success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success is not able to make the stairs of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this more to the neighbors and parents and friends that you please do not impose your expectations with your children.
Friends, Have you ever failed to live
Those who cannot bring good marks in the eam, they move ahead in sports, move ahead in music, move ahead in the art workshop, move ahead in business.
God has given some or the other wonderful legislation to everyone.
Just identify your inner strength, emphasize it, you will move forward.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santur.
There was a time when the Santur instrument was connected to the local Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and today made an important instrument of the world.
Shahnai - Shahnai was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and princes used to have their place on the gate.
But when Ustad Bismilla Khan handled Shahnai, today became the best instrument of the world, it has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the tracks of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no economic burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for prevention of cleanliness disease.
If someone can do the biggest service of the poor, then cleanliness can be done.
And the other one for which I urge is Yoga.
Some people call him Yoga too.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction for Yoga all over the world, there is also faith and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have given us a precious gift, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress gives yoga the strength to live a balanced life.
These are the achievements of a person associated with yoga, being healthy, being balanced, being rich in strong will, being a life full of unprecedented self-confidence and being concentrated in every work.
June 21 - Yoga Day, this is not just an event, it should increase its business, it should become its place in every person's life, every person should eat for 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his routine.
And for this 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes a collective environment causes a change in the life of the person.
Look at it, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, in your city, in your school, in the institute and in every office.
Start a month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that in many offices, as soon as there is a collective yoga and pranayama in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to stay behind anywhere.
Your health is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I consistently join you with the word Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, you all again salute.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this situation, Ravi ji has expressed his anger, but I believe that he is not angry at me, is angry at the situation, you will remember that the former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that just publish positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to say this thing continuously a few days ago, a newspaper had written to me and he had said that we have decided that we will not give any negative news on Monday, I have seen some T.
This time also I have seen that many letters, comments, phone calls have received many stories, suggestions, inspirations, everyone wants to do something or the other, one feels ashamed and there is a lot of things that I want to absorb, but there is a limit of time, so I cannot even absorb.
You will remember the last time I had discussed a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some things with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was watching that a large number of people shared information about many types of books
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, life character and many such topics.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many other books
But I have to acknowledge that now I ' m not able to read a lot of books
But one advantage is that if you write and send, I am getting the opportunity to know about many books.
But this is the experience of the last one month, I think we have to move forward.
Why don't we make a permanent books coordinator on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write about it and discuss it and you can sign a good name for our books coordinator.
Friends, It seems that in the matter of water conservation, when I had touched this thing, but perhaps today I am feeling that even before I say that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart, it was a favorite subject to the common man.
And I am feeling that these days the hearts of India have swinged about water .
Several farewell and effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation.
There are governments, NSGs - something at the war level
Looking at the capabilities of collectiveness, the mind is very happy, it is getting satisfactory.
Villagers donated labour to give a certain direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountain.
that too pure domestic way
This has not only stopped soil cuts and crop waste, but also the fields are getting water
You all will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East Meghalaya has become the first state in the country to prepare its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of those crops is being promoted, in which less water is required and there is no harm to the farmer.
I would especially like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with farmers and inspiring them from traditional farming, for low water crops.
The time has come for the festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all sections of society reach the fairs
In these fairs, we can give the message of saving water in a very effective manner, exhibitions, dramatics and water conservation.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with zeal and especially the achievements of the children, their actions, give us new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Ananth Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aronyatesh Ganguly and Heritik Ala-Manda.
You will also be filled with pride and zeal from what I will tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word that scares the whole world
It seems that all these ten children are standing at the door of death, but in the battle of their lives, not only have defeated the fatal disease like cancer, but have illuminated the name of India all over the world with their actions.
In sports, we often see that sportspersons become champions after winning or honsing medals, but this was a rare occasion where they were champions before participating in the sports competition and that too.
Actually, this month, World Children Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer residue i. e.
In this competition, competitions like Shooting, Hesse, Swimming, Running, Hootball and Table Tennis were organized.
All these ten champions of our country won the medal in this tournament.
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and thereafter there was no more discussion of the big and important news like A-Sat at that time under the supervision of Handryan-two elections.
While we got the ability to kill Satellite, three-and-a-half kilometers away from the A-Sat missile in just three minutes.
India, which achieved this achievement, became the fourth country in the world and now on 22nd July, the entire country was proud to see how the Handriyaan-two moved from Sriharikota to space.
The pictures of the launch of Handryan-two filled the countrymen with pride and joy.
Handryan-two, this mission is special in many ways.
Handryan-two, will make our understanding of the moon even more clear
This will give us more detailed information about the moon, but if you ask me what two big learnings have been received from the Handriyaan-two, then I will say, these two learnings are health and careless i. e.
We must trust our talents and capabilities, trust our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that handloom-two are completely covered in Indian color.
It is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is a completely indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when things are going to pass some new taxes in the new fields, I would like to say.
Just like our scientists, in record time, in the day-night, by finishing all the technical issues, the launch of Handriyaan-two is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
We all must be proud of this and despite the interruption they have not changed the time to reach , many are surprised .
We have to face the temporary problems in our lives as well, but always remember that we have the ability to overcome it.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I want to share information about a very interesting competition with the students and young friends of the country and invite the youth of the country to a ui Competition.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this ui competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable by my share.
I urge schools, parents, encouraging teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
These victorious students will have a historic event of their lives, but for this, you have to take part in the ui Competition and get the highest marks, you have to be victorious.
My dear countrymen, you must have done one thing.
The words of our minds have speeded up the cleanliness campaign from time to time and the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the matter of mind.
Five years ago, the journey started today with the participation of the people, is setting new standards of cleanliness.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in sanitation, but the way in which cleanliness campaign has been successful in public places, it is the power of the resolve of one and a half million people, but we are not going to stop at all.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty .
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in Media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean, but also beautiful
He started with his team with Lodhi Garden wastes
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi worked to decorate with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the Ver Bridge and the school to the slums, when they began to decorate their skills, they also met with the people and in a way this series started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with strong paintings during Kumbh.
There may not be any voice in colors and lines, but the message of those pictures made by them that are indradhanush proves to be even more effective than thousands of words and we also feel this in the beauty of the cleanliness campaign.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of wealth to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste from waste.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov.
This conference was from Mohammed Aslam, brother of Shopian of Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to hear Mann Ki Baat program
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This program was organized in June.
I think such programs should be organized every three months .
At the same time, there should also be an online monitoring arrangement of the programme.
According to me, this was the first such programme in which the public interacted directly with the government.
Brother Mohammed Aslam ji sent me this message and after reading it, I was keen to know about the Back to Willage Programme and when I went in detail about it, I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never seen the villagers reached the villages directly, they reached their doorsteps so that the obstacles in development could be understood and the problems could be solved.
This programme lasted a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state government officials briefed the villagers about government schemes and programmes in detail
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of the common man  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, This programme was not a government feedback that the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat and got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also incorporated to make this programme interesting
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST certificates were also distributed.
People of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is a matter of great joy that the Back to Village programme was also organized in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organise Gram Sabhas in these areas, to participate in a large number of people and to prepare schemes for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstructions, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented the glory of the month of Savan in one of his poems.
People of different culture and languages celebrate the month of Savan in their own way throughout India.
Whenever We look around us , it seems as if the earth had covered the greenery .
All around, there's a new energy communication.
In this sacred month, many devotees visit Kanwad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan also comes to the symbol of the love of brother and sister.
When the matter is going on in the month of Sawan, you will be very happy to know that this time most devotees have joined Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the pilgrims who had joined this journey for 60 days in 2015, have joined in just 28 days this time.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests.
Those who come back from the journey, they become convinced of the feelings of the people of the state and the feeling of their own.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have been told that since this year in Uttarakhand, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month and a half.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those parts of the country whose beauty is seen during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the emotions of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps there can be no teacher bigger than that.
My best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan to transmit new energy, new hopes and new hopes to all of you.
Likewise , the month of August comes to remember India .
I would like to make some special preparations on 15th August to enhance peoples participation in finding a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
On the other hand, this is the time when heavy rains are happening in many parts of the country
By the way, when we see T, the same aspect of rain is seen on all sides, floods, filled water, traffic jams
The second picture of the monsoon in which our farmers, swinging birds, flowing waterfalls, the earth covered with greenery, you will have to go out with yourself.
I wish that this monsoon continues to fill you with happiness, both rain, freshness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
Today people from the Christian community are celebrating the Easter.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the Easter.
And for some people there will be a criterion that on the one hand, eam and on the other, T-20 cricket world up, maybe even today you will have to wait for the Match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A good momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I convey my best wishes to the players of both teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports.
It is time for a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
India won Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 Asian Games and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Limpic Games.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower layer, left behind, fell, fell.
Hootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestion
I consider a very big opportunity to brand India globally.
I consider the opportunity to identify India's youth power and what was found between Match and what was lost in that sense.
Even through the preparation of this host, we can decorate our strength, express power and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, Narendra ModiApp
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism in the days of holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time I had urged you to upload photos from wherever you go.
People, language, food and drinks do not know what they can see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you go out to see, you will be watching all your life, you will be watching
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to travel a lot.
When he was not the Chief Minister, he was not the Prime Minister and was a younger age like you, I traveled a lot.
I think it's a good sign.
It gives a chance to see something new in itself.
I hope you can contribute to cleanliness when you visit these vacations
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way but it's happening.
Can you also focus on cleanliness as a tourist destination
I am sure my youth will help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But if we want to strengthen our tourism, we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism and provide employment opportunities to millions and millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is government or institutions, society or citizens, we all have to do this together.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, the vacations should come and run. I don't like this.
You also think in this direction.
Will you let your holidays go like this, the important year of life and its important time
I have a idea to think of you.
Can you resolve to add a new thing to your personality, a skill in holidays, can you
If you do not come to swim, you can make a resolution in the holidays, I learn to swim, if you do not have to run a cycle then I will run a cycle by fixing the holidays.
Even today, I type computer with two fingers, do I learn typing
How many types of skills are there for the development of our personality
Why don't you learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why don ' t we distinguish our powers
Now think and somebody needs a big clases, a trainer, a big ghee, a big budget is not there.
You must also assume that I will make the best of waste.
Look at something and start making it.
Namaste Prime Minister, you said in the last summer holidays that birds also feel heat, then we should put in a vessel in water in our balcony or on the roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I was happy, on the pretext of this, I got friends with many birds.
I urge you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I will say something on this subject but that expression reminded me that last year I was in the clay vessel outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi for a child.
He called me and reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donors and fill the hood, we will fill sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of very important things.
Shilpa jumped from Mysore, he has put a big sensitive issue for all of us.
He has said that those who sell milk come to our house, those who sell the newspapers come to the postman.
Sometimes those who sell some utensils pass through there, those who sell clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer days
Did we ever overwhelm him
I am very grateful to Shilpa, you have kept a very sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
It is true that the matter is small but if the postman came to the house during the summer and how good we would like to drink it.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But Shilpa, I am grateful that you have witnessed these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the markets, what is the round of good crops these days, which medicines are suitable, many subjects are on it.
Not only this, there is a button that directly connects you with agricultural scientists, connects you with the experts.
If you put a question in front of him then he answers, explains, you are.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters should download this Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phones.
Do you have some work from it
And yet if you feel some deficiency then you will also complain to me.
But we will also have to think about what will happen without water
Is it time for us to come to our ponds and ponds on the way to flow water, where the waste-waste or some encryption stops and the water conservation is gradually decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places once again for more water harvesting by cleaning them
If the water is saved in the first rain, if the pond is filled, our river drains are filled, then sometimes our loss is less.
This time you must have seen 5 lakh ponds, fields and ponds.
MNREGA has also stressed on creating cassettes for water conservation.
There will be many villages in the country, there will be many progressive farmers, there will be many aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more artificials has made our earth sick and we are the sons of mother Earth and children. How can we see our earth mother sick
It is the same for artisans, however excellent artificial, but if they use more or more artificials then they will become the cause of waste.
The more the water will save the farmers, the more the lives will be saved.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on this theme.
Diabetes is such a host that it is eager to host every disease.
Once diabetes enters, a lot of diseases followed by Kurupi guests enter their homes and in the body.
It is said that in 2014 there were about six and a half crore diabetes patients in India.
3 percent of death causes that diabetes were found.
And there are two types of diabetes, one Type-1, Type-2. Type-1, the family lives in Type-1.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so it has been kept in the World Health Day on 7th.
We all know that our life style is the biggest reason for him.
Physical labor is decreasing.
There is no name of sweat, there is no walking.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from 7th date
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't skeptical check-ups.
And after a very bad situation, it is remembered that Oh, I had very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was scared to hear the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that it can be investigated soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
Once you check it.
And this disease can go.
Just get proper treatment and treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat whether TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this government, doctors, medicines do not happen unless you do.
And that's why I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important opportunities in the month of April, especially on April 14, Bhimrao Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthday.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that on April 14 this year, I am fortunate to visit Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthplace Mau.
Baba Sahib has given a lot to become a better citizen.
We can pay great tributes to them by becoming an excellent citizen of that path.
In a few days, Vikram Sanvat will start.
Different states are celebrated in different states.
My best wishes to all for the New Year.
You can hear at your time.
You can hear your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to see the TV to get information about it.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have no opportunity to go.
He doesn't go to the same route as before, he wants to do something new, he wants to see something new.
And there is a possibility of employment through tourism.
And the identity of your personality and your confidence will increase so much.
This will probably talk to your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Facilitation App through your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your hand.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there has been an opportunity for the rest of the summer vacations but the farmers have an opportunity to excuse more sweat.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gets together to prepare his farm so that he does not want to allow one drop of rain to be wasted.
For the farmers, the time of the commencement of farming sector is very important.
Doesn't the same food feel bad
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become irresponsible to TB.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
You must have listened to my mind on the radio, but the minds of the children are starting the ease, some people's ease of tenth to twelfth is probably starting on March 1.
So it will be the same in your mind too.
I also want to be a partner with you in this journey.
I am equally worried about your children's ease.
But if we change our way to see the exam, we may be worrisome.
I had said in my mind that you must send your experiences and suggestions on the Narendra ModiApp.
I am glad that the teachers have been very successful, their career has been done by such students, parents and some thinkers of the society have written a lot of things to me.
Secondly, thousands of things have come that I believe that this is perhaps a very important subject.
But mostly we have limited the topic of eam to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions made on my app show that these topics of students should continue to be discussed in a very big way, all over the country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers in this matter of mind.
I have heard of what I have read, I will also tell some of the things that I have been told.
I will also add what I think.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to give ease.
I would like to hear the message that he has sent to the youth of India, such a Bharat Ratna, Shriman Sachin Tendulkar, I am speaking to Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that the FEMs are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
I have only one message that your parents will do expeditions to you, your teachers, your rest of your family members and friends.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparations are going on, how many percent will score you.
This is what I would like to say that you will set some targets for yourself, you will not come under the pressure of anybody else's defense.
You must work hard, but set a reality target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to indulge in a solution.
And that is why I always tried to achieve the targets.
My focus was on ballet pay and targets became self-reliant and self-reliant.
I will tell you that your thinking is very important.
Positive thinking will be followed by positive results.
So you will be nurtured and the upper person will certainly give you good results, this is my full hope and I would like to give you the best wishes for Heams.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't press these activities under the burden of efficiency.
You have to make your future.
Deciding your goals by yourself, set your targets by yourself - with a free mind, with a free thinking and with a free capability.
Why not competitive
Why do we waste our time in competitiveness with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, you will not be able to stop anybody from moving forward and when you break your previous record, you will not be expecting anybody else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from within.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a mark game.
Where to reach, how much
Don't be stuck in that account.
Life should be linked to a great purpose.
One should take a dream and be committed.
These examinations, whether we are going to be right or not, they account for it.
And that's why if you keep dreaming of a huge, giant, then the examination will become an enjoyment festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great purpose.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Go with a very big objective and sometimes there will be nothing less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And to force, to empower, and to try.
Thousands of people have written me small things from my mobile phone on my app.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Studies should take care of their studies and their health so that you can write well in the ease.
Now on the last day, I will not say that you will start penalties and go to run three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how your routine is especially in the days of the time.
Anyway, 365 days of our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with the words of Shriman Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has urged him to sleep on time and to revive early in the morning.
Enterprises and other things should be reached at the Ease of Doing Business Centre before time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I do not dare to say, because I am a little apathy about gold and my friends also complain that you sleep very little.
This is a deficiency of me, I will also try to cure.
The time of prescribed sleep, deep sleep is as important as your activities throughout the day and this is possible.
Otherwise there is a habit of some people, they keep talking on long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk of gold, don't think that I am asking you to sleep for Leam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to examine you at the time of Eam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be so much that the marks should come down and mother asked why sons, if they come down then say that Modi ji had asked to sleep, then I had slept.
You don't do that
I don't believe you.
If one-and-a-half organs and one-and-a-half part of our body suffer a little then you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable.
Not only this, our routine is also ruined.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You must see, do not compress yourself in the habit of compressing yourself.
Deciding, look at it.
You must have seen these two types of people.
There is a negative effect on the consequences of the paper that comes in its tension.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experience.
You must have seen, their eyes do not even go around.
Never did we listen to the incident of Arjun's life how he looked at the bird's eyes.
When Viswanathan is playing in the same way, his eyes are at a very big target and he is an expression of inner peace.
It is true that somebody should say, that is why the peace within will come again, it is difficult to say but it should be tried.
If you are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are swinging and swinging, you are swinging a lot of books and then they cannot be calm.
You imagine that you are standing on the shore of a pond and you see very good things below.
But suddenly if someone hits stones and starts shaking water, then what was the best seen below, do they see
If the water is calm, then how deep things are, it is visible.
But if the water is disturbed, then nothing is seen below.
You will not be able to discover the treasury if you have a distressed mind.
If you feel quiet, then your treasure will emerge and your ease will become easier.
So sometimes I try to understand more concentration and I feel stress within one.
Then I think, no-no, I'm going to relax a little, then I'll be good.
So I have developed myself.
I'm breathing too long.
I breathe deep.
Three-five times I breathe deeply, it takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds and 50 seconds, but then my mind becomes ready to understand things by getting quiet.
Maybe this is my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents have also been read in the house and even if there are teachers in it, then tell the whole paper again, what did you write, what happened
Hey, I made a mistake.
Hey, I knew this, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in it.
With the family and on topics, refresh the old laughing memories.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Just get out of them and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting him in the present context, he is trying to reach Sarita this rites in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to the devotee Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that the people who have told me this time have discussed Yoga in their experiences.
And it is a matter of great pleasure for me that somebody whom I meet in the world, why not get a little time, somebody does something about yoga.
Well, friends, I just say today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga don't do it today, don't do it.
Do it then.
But it is true that yoga is a very big key in the development journey of the innermost, whether it is in the student's life or in the last half of his life.
The simple key is.
You must pay attention to him.
Yes, if you are aware of any yoga near you, if you ask them then you will not have done yoga in the days of Eam, you will also tell them two-four things that you can do in two-five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yeah, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very quick to go to the examination hall.
Why do you do these things in a hurry
Why do not you manage the time of your entire day so that even if we stay in traffic, we will reach on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is that the time we have received, the question papers that are infrastructures, sometimes we feel that it will eat our time.
It's not like this, buddy.
You must read these instruments very closely. Two minutes-three-five minutes will go and there will be no harm.
But with confidence, this paper is now with me, no new questions are coming to me, I have to deal with such questions and when I started thinking again, they have written that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I felt that it does not come to me, but if I read the same thing again then I came to mind that no questions have been placed in other ways, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand questions.
Do not understand the questions, sometimes the question seems difficult.
I urge Yash Nagar to read the questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match it with what you know.
It is a matter of great happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed on patience.
In very few words, but we have given a very good message to all the students.
What I take half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Whatever they have said, it is dedication, determination, diligence, stay, friends, stay here.
If you are standing, then you will also be afraid.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good.
Now a message on my App, Ruchika Dabbs has shared her exam efficiency.
He said that there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of ease in his family and this was also discussed in his fellow families.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, positive approach, positive frame of mind-positive energy.
Whatever you may be at any stage of life, the best examples, the truth events also inspire a lot, give a lot of strength and make a new way at the time of crisis.
We all read about the inventor Thomas Elva Edison of Electricity Bulb, about it in our syllabus.
But today that electrification, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that failure also contains the possibilities of success.
JK Rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Harry Potter Series are popular all over the world today.
But it was not so from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face.
Rolling himself had said that in difficulties, all the energy used to be used in the work that actually mattered for them.
Nowadays, we are not only a student but also a teacher of the entire family and the entire school.
However, without the support system of parents and teachers, the situation is not good.
Be it technicians or participants or even senior students, all these together, we move ahead with a team, united thinking and planned methods, then the examination becomes easier.
Shriman Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App, he has complained that Parents should never put pressure on their children to demand more marks.
Only to prepare should be encouraged.
They should be relating to it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not put the burden of his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to tell Parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, do not stop.
Make a light atmosphere, create a positive environment, see how much connectivity your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead of the week of science.
The curiosity is the birth of science.
Knowledge, Science and Technology, all these things should be a part of our development journey and this time theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, Sometimes successes are very late and when success is achieved, the view of the world also changes.
Perhaps you might have been very busy in the eam, so perhaps a lot of news has not been registered in your mind.
But I want to repeat this thing to the countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important food in the world of science.
The scientists of the world have worked hard, generations have come, something has been done and a success has been achieved after about 100 years.
Gravitational aspects were exposed to the pursuit of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire human species is going to work all over the world, but as an Indian, we all are happy that the sons of our country and the promising scientists of our country were also associated with it in the process of search.
I would like to congratulate all those scientists from heart today.
Our scientists will also be trying to pursue this treasure in the future.
There is such a system in two places in the world, India is the third.
The connectivity of India will give this process a new strength and a new pace.
India will surely become an active partner in the process of this great scientific diet of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, from tomorrow you can hear my mind from this number by calling a mixed call, you can also hear in your mother tongue.
I also have to give feam tomorrow.
1. 25 billion Indians are going to take my ease of doing business.
But yes, you must have seen that I must have heard how healthy I am, how much confidence I am.
Just get my ease tomorrow, start yourself.
And if we are all successful then the country will also succeed.
Friends, I extend my best wishes to you all.
Free from the stress of success and failure, move ahead of the free mind and stand.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I look at this portal, from Pune, Shri Ganesh V.
No, we have to make changes according to the needs of India. The poor person wages somewhere, he has physical labour, but by innovation, makes a thing that the poor gets a little comfort in wages. I consider it a start-up.
Then I came to my mind that with the eyes we feel that perhaps he is disabled, but with experience it feels that he has a metra power and additional power. And why should we not use the word Divya instead of disabled in our country . These are those people who have such a part or more organs in which there is a communication of divine power, which we do not have with ordinary body. Is it very good for me to propagate the word 'Divyang' in place of human disabled'
I would like to send this portal to the younger generation of my country to give a small suggestion on duty. On January 26, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we finish the best ornament from the best and best on 26 January by the citizens, by the children of school colleges, the statues of all the great men in our city, the cleanliness, the cleanliness of that campus.
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
During the sacred festival of Deepawali, you must have celebrated the holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business jobs have also started.
On the other hand, Christmas preparations will also be started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to fill the wounds and sometimes the festival gives new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes at this time of the festival, it becomes more painful and painful.
There are frequent natural calamities from every corner of the world.
And there are reports of such natural calamities that have never heard or thought.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
In our country, in the past, the manner in which the rains and rains have been caused for a long time, especially in Tamil Nadu, and the states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I express my condolences to all those families during this crisis.
State governments gather with full strength in relief and rescue work.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am confident that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward at a very fast pace and will continue to play the role of him in pursuing the country.
But when we see these things of crisis around, we have need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be a part of an agricultural department, because then more natural calamities i. e.
Today it has changed its form.
After the Nepal earthquake, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shriman Nawaz Sharif.
A good beginning has happened.
I got Lakhwinder Singh's phone from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking to Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide many people about farming.
I have a question about how the people who set fire to these fields, how to guide them to the pool or the horse bacteria that are being polluted to the mother Earth and how to get relief from this in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji was very happy to hear your message.
One is happy that you are a biological farming farmer.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers properly.
And your concern is correct but this is not the case only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of our people all over India and traditionally we follow the path of burning the remains of our crop.
Secondly, what are the measures, there is no training.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come towards the cities, some voices were also heard.
But the pain you have expressed is right.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They are a biological manure in themselves.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the earth is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, think that our bones are strong, our hearts are strong, kidneys are good, everything is good but if the skin above the body is burnt then what will happen
Similarly, burning the remains of these crops does not only burn the thumbs, this earth burns the skin of the mother.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And that's why his positive efforts should be made.
Once again, it becomes a fertilizer.
Or if you put a little water in a pit by placing a pile in a pit, then it becomes the best type of organic manure.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated banana.
And he told me a great experience.
Earlier, when he used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was over, he had to spend 5 thousand, 10 thousand and 15 thousand rupees per hectare to clean the bananas.
And as long as the people who raised him did not bring a tractor-vactor, they were standing like this.
But some farmers tried to pieces of 66 and 8 inches of that piece and buried it on the ground.
The experience came that there is so much water in the throats of this banana that where it is buried, if there is a tree, there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get out for three months.
Those who had to spend the first sanitation of the thumb, today the demand for the thumb has increased.
Our farmer brother is not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will remember the international day of personality with disabilities.
Last time I had discussed the organ movement in the matter of mind.
I had also discussed the helpline of NET for organ movement and I was told that after that, there was an increase of about 7 times in the phone calls.
Along with film actress Rabina Tandon, many renowned people are associated with it.
Cargan Convention can save valuable lives.
Angadan comes in a way with immortality.
When the organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What else can be the best donation from this.
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness on this sector and the needy will get better help in the true sense, because this help cannot be received from anywhere else until no one donates.
As I told earlier, 3 December is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped are also rich in an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes pain occurs when sometimes they ridicule.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, change their vision, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass.
If we get a little trouble then we sit to cry.
Then remember that my crisis is very small, how does it spend
And that is why these are the source of inspiration for us.
His will power, his way of fighting with his life and the way of converting the crisis into capability is also worthy.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years old.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
He lost one part of the intestine and intestine.
Serious nature has become special injury.
The ability to stand on his feet always went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even reflect them.
His own zeal, but the biggest thing is that without any reason a innocent person has suffered such a major trouble, the youth has become in danger, but no resentment, no anger, Javed Ahmed has turned this crisis into sensitivity.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been drowned in children's studies.
How did the infrastructure improve for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life sufficient to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember Javed Ahmed's life, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
Even though I am talking about Javed in the absence of time, such inspiration is burning in every corner of India.
They are giving a new light to live, showing the way.
There is an opportunity to get inspiration from all such people on 3rd December.
Our country is so large.
There are many things in which we are dependent on governments.
Be it a middle class person, a lower middle class person, a poor, a Dalit, afflicted, deprived and deprived, there is constant connection with government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, sometimes there is a bad experience from some government Babu in life.
And that bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system for a long time.
But sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do good work with service, dedication and dedication that never come to our sight.
Sometimes we don't even know because it is so comfortable that we don't know that any government system, no government is doing this thing.
ASA workers in our country who have a network across the country.
We have never heard of the discussions between the people of India and the ASA orchards.
But when I am the world famous family entrepreneur of the Billgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
We gave such billgates and Milindagates to both of them the last time we gave joint Padma Vibhushan.
They do a lot of social work in India.
He is spending time for his retirement and whatever he earns all his life for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and appreciate those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASA workers, they appreciate them so much, and they have so much to say that they work as to what they dedicate to the hope-worker.
He tells us how much enthusiasm is to learn new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has given a special honor to an ASA Forker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is a hope-employer and all the population of the country is a scheduled tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Mani Singh, a hopeful worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this Tendgaon.
If he gets home and gets to know about a small fever.
Based on the primary arrangements taught to him, it should be for treatment.
Emphasis on the use of insecticide mosquito net every household.
As soon as your child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with full dedication for avoiding the entire village mosquitoes.
And he fought malaria, prepared to fight the whole village.
How many such Jamuna Mani will be.
How many millions of people will be around us.
We'll look at them a little respectfully.
How many such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How to become a big companion of the happiness and grief of the society.
I glorify all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see this.
Not only this, read it to others and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss Books and if any enthusiastic youth go to the schools of the neighborhood, tell the eighth, nineth, tenth grade children that look, brother, this happened here.
So you can become a social teacher in true sense.
I invite you to join you in nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate Change, Global Warming, Dugger-Dugger are also discussed and it is getting approval as a standard before doing every work.
Earth's temperature should not increase anymore.
This is also the responsibility of everyone.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, one should bathe in the full moonlight by shutting down the street lights and darkening.
You should experience the light of that moon.
When a friend sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see him, I felt that I would tell you this too.
By doing a light in Kanpur, a woman does not seem to have got the opportunity to read more.
But they are doing a job that perhaps nobody has thought.
He is working to give light to the poor by using solar energy.
He is fighting the dark and illuminating his name.
He has created a committee of women and lanterns running with solar energy have planted a plant and he gives lanterns at a rent of Rs 100 per month.
There is a cost of about Rs. 3-4 per day but there is light throughout the house and this light keeps working throughout the day to recharge this lantern from solar energy in that plant.
Now see what the world's big people would have done for climate change, but a light is probably inspiring everyone.
And anyway, Noorjaha means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Nurjaha and I congratulate Gee T because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Congratulations.
Thanks to Abhishek ji
The message you sent me from Gorakhpur.
Prime Minister MRA scheme under the funded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Prime Minister MRA scheme.
Dhobi, Nai, a newspaper seller, a milk seller.
And I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are people of ST and B who try to run the family with respect to their feet by working hard.
Abhishek himself has told his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone told me now that somebody has done a shailesh bhosle in Mumbai.
He received a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank under the MRA scheme.
And they started the business of cleaning and swag dress.
I had said during my Swachhta Abhiyan that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosle did it.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time, they also returned the bank.
Eventually this is the intention of our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make a batuwa.
And he used to make a batuva but earlier he used to bring money with more interest and was very difficult to do business.
Now due to a good amount of rupees coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to the extra interests and due to the reasons that he had spent these days, the money was saved nearly a thousand rupees every month due to his hand.
And a good business began to grow gradually to his family.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help more and more small people.
These people actually run the economy of the country.
Those who do small jobs are the economic power of the country.
We want to force him.
It's good, but it's better to do.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed a India-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are things that should continue to be aware of social life.
This rites of unity of the nation should continue to be simplified.
I want to make it a scheme for Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on it.
How is the structure of the programme
What are the people
How to increase public participation
I had asked for all the suggestions.
I was told that many suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Any majorprices have also been declared.
You must also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity be connected to one India-Shreshtha Bharat
What is the plan, what is the program
Whether it is lifelong or magnificent, it is lifelong and it is easier to connect everyone.
What do the government do
What will the civil society do
There may be many things.
Wearing clothes enjoys, but I'm urging you to exercise.
I would urge you to use this good weather for some time to keep the body fit.
And make an atmosphere in the family, be it a festival of the family, it is to do all this together for an hour.
So there is a good weather, then get a good habit.
Once again, I got the privilege of connecting with you all with the point of view of mind.
Today, the fifth day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This is the series named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
Congratulations are because when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I once again have to talk about Kerala today.
The students of Saint Mary Per-Primary School of Chittor, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is many special.
One, these girls have made a picture of Bharat Mata with their thumb marks, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me the picture of the map of India and Mother India.
Earlier I was surprised why they made a map of India with their thumb marks.
But when I read his letter, I came to know how good a symbolic message he has given.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
He is also trying to make people aware and his mission is Angadan.
They are running public awareness campaigns for transit donation.
He has also visited many places and performed theatres so that the understanding of Angadan spread among the people.
Angadan became a trend and tendency.
These girls have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about organ donation in your mind.
They say Angadan should make a festival.
These days, I have a lot of messages on the phone call.
Devesh of Delhi has given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
Organ of the body can be donated on death in road accidents.
There's a lot of legal complications.
Efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a lot of efforts to reduce paperwork and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forward line in the field of Organ donation.
Many social institutions, many NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
The National Organization and Tissue Transplant Organization (NTT) has been set up to promote organ transplant.
This service is also available in a 247 elephant 1800114770.
And it has been said here that the excellent description of the joy of renouncing Ten Tuberculosis Bhunjitha is in this mantra.
In the past, we had seen on TV that a poor man, Hocker and his wife were transplanted in GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And this Liver was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by special arrangements.
And that operation was successful.
A life has survived.
Angadan Mahadan
Let us realize this feeling and we must emphasize this.
My dear countrymen, we have just celebrated Navaratri and Vijaya Dashmi.
And after a few days, they will also celebrate the festival of Deepawali.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Churti is also celebrated.
For the first time on the earth of India, such a big scale is being organized.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
A major conference of African countries is happening outside Africa.
The relations between India and Africa are deep.
The population of India is as much population of African countries.
And if we mix both, we are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago, this was the same territory.
Later, these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of equality.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of African countries.
More than 25 thousand African students have read in India for Human Resource Development, Facility Building.
And today there are leaders from many countries of Africa and have studied in India.
So how deep is our relationship
And from that point of view this summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, heads of different countries meet.
Similarly, there is a meeting of chiefs in a summit.
It is our endeavour to meet the people.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the RD Ministry, has done a very good programme.
The programme of Say Competition was organised among the children of BSL, the programme of writing poems and enhancing their participation.
Nearly 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote things that strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to Memorials of Maharashtra is a exhibition, mobile exhibition from Porbandar to Northern States on 29th October.
Millions of school children saw this exhibition, the villagers saw it.
There were many kinds of compositions in this competition.
I look at a composition, I like it, so I want to hear you.
But it clearly shows us how to connect people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RD Ministry.
On August 15, I had made a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana last time.
After that many MPs have fulfilled this work.
Stay with a big mind.
There was a workshop in Bhopal last month.
In which these ideal villages are being constructed, the heads of the village, the collectors there, some MPs of the country, the Indo-Government and the state-Government together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas have been wasted.
But our MPs are very senior, sometimes deputy-speaker in Parliament, Shriman Kariya Munda ji, he has spent his life for tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate Honble MP Shriman Kariya Munda ji.
That's what I got from Andhra.
Andhra Pradesh MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself was supplied in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose Puri Gram Panchayat for Adarsh Gram through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the system is happening, but they have done a big special innovation.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane Festival on 11th March in the village.
People of all the areas united in it.
How can the village be made the center of economic activity, how can it be marketed for the production of the village
Her efforts to build an Adarsh village as well as a self-sufficient village are really officers of Shriman Ruwala ji's congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it happen if there is talk of cleanliness and cleanliness
Savita Roy has sent me a message from Mumbai through a telephone every year we clean our houses for the preparation of Diwali.
We make this Diwali clean along with our houses and our outer environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I would like to recall you, my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media, especially in our country, launched a big campaign and after Diwali, wherever the firecrackers were lying, they said that this is not good.
So your point is that we should do as much concerns before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today, especially I would like to congratulate all the media world of India.
India Awards and I was also watching how many activities are going on.
How people are working as a One Like One Mission for this.
How are the places that have been kept so clean in our country
All these things have been exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of the India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that T.
He added about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, in many places a big campaign for cleanliness.
Now these news shows the strength to realize the dream of a clean India in itself.
ABP News has launched this programme in the name of my country and has worked to train the people of the country by highlighting how they have been aware of cleanliness.
There are hundreds of channels and thousands of newspapers in our country, everybody, I am unable to take the names of all, but I have launched this campaign because of lack of time.
And that is why Savita Roy ji has suggested that today the entire country is accepting this work and taking it forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Shri Shanmuganathan, he has written a letter to me and has mentioned me in Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya by writing a letter.
He has written that for the last several years this village has taken up a piece of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he had received the award as Asia's leading delegation.
That is why we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to call our mother India as a pride and pride.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on August 15 that there are some things where corruption has been done at home.
When the poor person goes for a small job, nobody knows what he has to suffer and how the brokers grabbed his money from him.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who fully examines a person in one minute and two minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why we are the jobs of this small pair, we should finish the tradition of interview.
My dear young friends, today I want to say that the government has completed all the procedures and there will be no interview for recruitment in the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B.
1st January, 2016 will be implemented
We will not interrupt where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to all young friends
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important plan.
In our country, gold has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold has been considered a medium of economic security.
Crisis time has been considered as key gold.
Gold can become the economic property of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am happy that in this festival of Diwali that we have promised in the budget and when Dhanteras and people buy gold especially on that day, we are going to launch important schemes before that.
We have brought the World Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now the gold will be kept in the bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say that the countrymen can now become gold property or not
Cannot gold be converted from Head-Money into a living force
This is what we have to do with me.
Do not keep gold in the house now.
Another thing is that you don't have a lot of gold in the sovereign world bonds.
So you will get two and a half thousand rupees in exchange for that paper.
So we are starting this.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and there will be no one to steal the paper.
So I will surely put this scheme with security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold queens.
The Gold Coin with Ashok Chakra, about 70 years of independence, but till now we have been using original Gold Coin or the Gold Bullion Bars have also been using foreigners.
At the same time, the world mission of twenty grams will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring about a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, Iron Man is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
One India Shreshtha Bharat
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of the entire India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to the unity of India.
Iron-male has introduced its capabilities as a man.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but he had the dream of uniting India.
Geographically, he showed tax, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our contemplation, behaviour, expression.
Several sects, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many environments, how many diversity is our country and this diversity is because of which we are glorious.
If this was not a diversity then perhaps the glory for which we are proud cannot be done.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the roots of development.
For the last several years, on October 31, there are programmes of Run for Unity in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time also its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race for development in true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race for unity.
Come, pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Proceed the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, now all of you will be engaged in the preparation of Diwali.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come in mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Deepawali, I have to visit Britain.
I am very excited for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such segments of society, be it Dalits, tribals, backwards, those who go abroad.
I am confident that when our children of India go to study in Britain, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them, inspiration will become a land and learn something in life but later for the country, this message was given by Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am saying that during my visit to Britain, I am particularly thrilled, for many years the topics were complicated and now that building is the property of 1. 25 billion Indians, if Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name is connected then you can imagine how many people like me will be happy.
I will also get another opportunity in London, the unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Vishwaswar for democracy and for the employment of women is a really studying aspect of the world.
On the land of London, the dedication of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar is an excellent example of how many centuries ago the great men of India used to think.
So you know that when such incidents occur, the minds of all the countrymen get thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with the talk of mind.
Through telephone, I keep getting your suggestions through MyGov.
Akashwani is also discussed in the matter of your letters.
The government officials are called and discussed.
Some people write their problems, efforts are also made to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
Some languages have been fortunate to learn but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But still I am grateful to Akashwani that they broadcast this mind at 8 pm in every state's regional language.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the matter is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, salute you all.
I don't consider it bad. I am very good to see that the Parliament of the country is also discussing the sanitation of India and on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, Parliament and on the other hand, this country's child should talk about sanitation, what can be the fortune of the country.
Institutions of local Swaraj, whether it is Panchayat or Nagar Panchayat or Municipality or Municipal Corporation or State or Centre, all have to work on this. We have to move forward this movement, despite the shortcomings, and when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
And I was surprised that the entire Gita was consolidated to her. But when I asked her, she used to define her, she used to define her in English, she used to define her in Hindi. I asked her father, she said, I have been speaking from the age of five years.
He said, we do not even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does something else
Once again, to talk about your mind, I have got the opportunity to come among you.
In the remote south, people are coloured in the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes regarding social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, in a comprehensive quantity, all have accepted these schemes.
I had made a small resolution that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we will give these security plans to our sisters.
I have received a comprehensive information that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the launch of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in large numbers a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
The ero Balance had to open an account but the poor saved and saved the amount of Rs.
The mainstream of the economy is banking sector and this system has reached the house of the poor, so the bank-friend's plan has also been emphasized.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Not only have the accounts to be stuck and now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraw under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all those concerned and all those who open the bank accounts also urge the poor brothers and sisters not to break the relationship with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it now.
I have brought you, now it's your job to hold him.
All of us should be active
But in a very short span of time, all my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again on the path of peace, Gujarat went on.
This is the right path of peace, unity and brotherhood and we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
There was an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the way in which way I got the opportunity to listen to them, some kind of music is playing.
The select of his words, the way of his conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, the beauty of a music, all of them have experienced me among these scholars.
I liked it very well.
Perhaps it has become the most important to reach the world in the right form of Islam.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love, liberality, will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit human species, will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we don't believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days and I consider this invitation as my fortune.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions from many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss the global topics related to humanity, I have also been invited and it is a matter of great pleasure for me that they have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru was Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you especially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in the matter of mind.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard in public meetings, you must have heard in the matter of mind.
Every time I have been telling you that the government's mind is open in the matter of the dispute regarding the Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers. I have been saying this again and again.
This means that the situation that was before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one thing was incomplete, and it was 13 such points which were to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it to the ordinance but the matter was also confused by these disputes.
Ordinance is finishing but the farmers are going to get direct benefits, the direct economic benefits of the farmers are connected to these 13 points, we are implementing these 13 points under the rules, so that the farmers are not harmed or economic losses, and that is why we are fulfilling the 13 points that were left in the previous law. And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us. This is our mantra.
I have to say one more thing that two days before the 1965 war, it was fifty years ago and whenever the 1965 war comes, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra.
And it is natural to remember the tricolor flags of India, its honour and commemoration of all those martyrs.
I salute all those related to the victory of the 65 war.
I bow to the heroes.
And the incidents of such history continue to inspire us.
Just as I had the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, there was a very happy experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
I am glad that India is working in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to reach these amendments to the public.
How to convert the principles into tools
How to connect Hab with the Wand
He has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that it was also a very inspiring for me, it was also an education.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking to him, how the dreams were visible in his eyes.
And when I had said last time that our students should move towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I keep getting many letters from citizens.
From Thane, Shriman Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
Emphasizing on reforms in the education sector.
I also have to say one thing to my young friends that I had told the Red Fort on August 15 why this interview for the lower level job
All people run, and perhaps this is also a reason for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want to be free from the tradition of interview below one level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days, but the government is moving forward at a very fast pace.
The information is being sent, and the decision will now be implemented that small jobs will be exempted from the interview round.
The poor will not have to run for intercession.
There will be no exploitation, there will be no conception.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially the mothers and infants mortality, for their action plan, 24 countries from all over the world conceived together in the land of India.
This was the first time in any other country outside the United States.
And it is true that even today, about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die every year in our country at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
It's worrisome and scary.
Well, there's a lot of improvement.
India has also been appreciated internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue continues to come.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am not talking about Swachh Bharat is directly connected to it.
We see advertising on T. but we do not pay attention.
In the newspaper, advertisement is printed, but we do not pay attention.
There are ways to maintain clean water in small things in the house.
There is a comprehensive public education in these things, but we do not pay attention and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, are very good arrangements and it is not known that we are full of water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge you all that death should not be so cheap.
Life is very valuable.
Water carelessness, indifference to cleanliness, become the cause of death, this is not right
Free checking facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centres across the country.
It is useful to protect your lives from time to time and it is very important for all of you to cooperate with them.
And cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days there are festivals in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why don't we connect every festival with cleanliness now
You see the rites will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news, I always say that now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country, but we have got the opportunity to live for the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There is a ycle-race in the US and there is a race of about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long.
This year these two brothers won this race.
See, how everyone is making efforts to pursue the country.
And this is the case, when such incidents hear, the chest gets tight.
Sometimes due to exertion, we have done a terrible injustice to our youth.
And the older generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this process has been going on for centuries.
The experience in my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, then we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say, Brother, I have taken fast in my life on Sunday.
Some people say that I have been kept a day in a week.
My health is also good.
And I also enjoy being a young man.
Nowadays, cycle runs in many cities in our country and people who promote cycle are also very much.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today, when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in America, I liked to mention the direction in which the youth of India think.
I especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
I'm happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill of Mumbai had been hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now it will become a magnificent and inspirational monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, deprived and deprived.
But at the same time, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been purchased.
When Indians traveling around the world will go to London then Babasaheb Ambedkar's monument that is going to be built by the Maharashtra government will become an inspirational place.
I convey my best wishes to the Maharashtra government for honouring Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, you must tell me your ideas before coming to the next mind because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward only by joining the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing Kharif.
And a happy thing has come to me and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should have pulses, to eat vegetables etc.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, Kargil is marked as Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer is as much as the country's peasant.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers was heavy on hundreds and hundreds of enemies.
I bow down to those brave soldiers who failed the enemies without taking care of their lives.
The war of Kargil was not fought only on the borders, in every city of India, in every village, this war contributed.
These wars fought for those mothers, sisters whose soldiers were fighting against enemies in son or brother, Kargil.
Those daughters fought, with whose hands, Pehar's henna did not land.
And therefore, today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all these soldiers.
On 26th July, I consider it very important because after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on 26th July in a few months.
Our resolve to increase public participation in democracy, to connect people with development and I am happy to say that after one year, about two crore people have seen MyGov.
Nearly five and a half lakh people have communicated and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people have suggested on PM Applications, they have taken time and have made a mind-set.
Now it is a small thing, but nobody has come to this attention in the government, nor has it ever been thought of.
But on the suggestion of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government has seriously considered and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, those people who are formed, they are taglines, programmes are created, policy is created, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov.
There is a new rash air experience in the governance system.
There is a new consciousness.
These days, I have also started suggesting on MyGov what I should say on August 15.
Suchitra Raghavachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Speak on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this has brought me a idea, what should I speak on August 15, can you send me suggestions
You can send a letter to MyGov, you can write a letter on Akashwani and the Prime Minister can write a letter in the office.
I believe that perhaps this is a good idea that my speech of August 15 should be suggested from Janardhan.
I'm sure you'll send good suggestions.
I want to express my concern towards one thing.
I do not want to give any preachings nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibility of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I looked at the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver rolled for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people continue to write on the fact that you will speak something on the road safety.
Beware of the people, be the Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amey Joshi of Pune, be the pleasure of Murbidri in Karnataka.
And when you look at statistics, the heart beats.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, a death occurs every 4 minutes due to road accident.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of the people of 15 to 25 years of age are young and one death shakes the entire family.
Whatever work the government should do, but I pass through my parents, whether it is running two or two wheelers or running our wheelers, the environment of paying attention to the things of security must be increased in the family.
Another project is going to be expanded for us and it is going to be expanded later, ashles treatment is going to be done in Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia highways, we have an ashles treatment.
Toll-free number 1033, ambulance system to provide information regarding accidents across the country, but all these things have been done after the accident.
For not being accomplished, we all need to see each one of us, every one of us is very dear, every one of us is very dear and every one of us is very dear.
Sometimes I say, be an employee worker.
In the past, some incidents have come in my mind, I like to talk to you, sometimes people are tired of doing jobs and sometimes for some years, it is a good thing.
I am glad to see this big example that how artificiality can be brought in my work too.
This Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his capability can be linked to his work.
Maybe now Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And one thing came in my mind - the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the entire team started a work that touched my mind and I liked this work.
He started Operation Mala Yudh - Now someone, listening to it, will seem to be something else.
See how the meaning of Raksha Bandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Now a news has come to my ears and sometimes these small things give a lot of joy to my mind, so I am sharing with you.
There is a small village in Keshla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village have tried to make a toilet for the last few months.
And now no person in that village has to go to the open defecation.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
These are the best examples of how the society is changing the values of life, how the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding the questions of the North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's good.
But today I want to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, they will go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to people representatives and talk to the citizens.
You will listen to the problems, you will also do whatever the Government of India has to do in the direction of solving problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come to know how beautiful the state, how good people and now they have to be able to develop this area and to solve their problems.
Even after returning to Delhi with this resolution, it has become very simple to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to move from Delhi to far-off east, which I am calling the Act East Policy. This is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes it comes to the idea that today if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead then there will be one or half of the 100 students who will say that I have to become scientific.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
Encouraging innovation, encouraging them, knowing their capabilities, is a great need.
I also tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone forward by reading so much then you must talk to the children by going to a school college near you for two to four hours a week.
The power that you have in your experience will definitely be used for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have launched it and in the coming years, we will get 24 hours electricity to the villages.
If the children of the village have to read in the days of examination, then there is no problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity is available.
Today, even if you have to change mobile then you have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be given to the villages.
And that is why we have started the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme.
I know that such a big country has to reach lakhs of villages and villages far and wide.
But, for the poor, we have to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, there was a desire to talk about various things.
In a way, there is an opportunity for the month of August, the month of September and the festivals in our country.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your ideas will be very useful to me.
In the matter of previous mind, I had prayed to you people that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture there then incredible.
When I said, I didn't think that such a tremendous result would be found.
Millions of people posted photos, Twitter pages, facebook pages, in Instagram.
I can say, how many varieties India is filled with.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that in terms of tourism, people can do such a big job that you have done.
And I also felt so much that I also re-weeted him.
We will continue to move forward and the world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but the person within me sometimes loses himself from all other posts.
On 21st June, International Yoga Day, I can say that my mind was mounted in the same way as I had put this subject in NE.
We can say by claim that the sun never falls in the world of yoga practicers.
The way the world honoured Yoga and honoured it, the way the whole world raised it on its shoulders, who will be a Hindustani who will not be proud.
The mind was confused.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sin River and the Field Tower are very glorious symbols, they liked that place to do yoga, they gave equal place.
People in New York Yoga at Times Square.
If you talk of Australia, Sydney, then the picture of Pera House comes to us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same time by placing Yoga in equal to the Pera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPP-Kepping Force also performed Yoga very well.
Even in India, our soldiers were doing yoga on the white ice sheet, then there were programmes of yoga by the Navy in the sea, wherever our naval ships were there.
Delhi has recorded its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became a yoga path.
I am grateful to the country and the world and I can say that this was not the last programme.
It seemed that a new curiosity, a new joy, a new emotion, a new connectivity from every corner of the world.
A few days ago, when I had tweeted a photograph from Twitter, a family from Vietnam, using a small child, it was so favourable that it was so popular all over the world.
Everyone, women and men, be it old children, villages and cities, be it development centres or be it development centres, everyone has joined.
Yoga has become a reason for connecting the world in true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity has increased towards India.
The values, traditions and heritage here, the world wants to know.
We all have the responsibility to distribute the world, introduce the world to the heritage that we have without luggage.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things and what is new in it. We do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure it'll be amazing.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the best they have the right to the world.
The success of International Yoga Day has come with a new responsibility with joy and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the world the best yoga teacher.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from one platform to the world.
Introduction of institutions related to yoga, information about yoga gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then where can you learn, where should you get a yoga teacher, you should prepare a database and I believe you can do it.
Let us start somewhere, it will also become a new power.
I look at the events of the last few days with a view, the government, the government, the running government, once the goal is set, we have seen the results in the last few days.
And when there was disappointment, we should not forget that one year ago, one voice was heard from all sides, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government and never takes care of anyone.
If you come to the news about the smallest news once in 2-5 years then you will come here so much, in a corner, in a corner, in a corner, in a corner, but he led the Yoga Day.
And the small departments in the world have organized such a big task.
If the goal is in front, then the small units also do the best, it is a sample.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the people suffering from Yemen.
Within hours, the people of India had come to Nepal to get help, when the government working to open Jan Dhan accounts in the bank, the people of all the bank came to the ground and in a short time they connected millions of countrymen with the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed to the Red Fort for toilets in schools and I had said that by August 15, we have to complete this work.
It was a great courage to call upon the work that could not be done in 60 years, about four and a half lakh toilets were made, but today I can say with satisfaction that it is delayed on 15th August, but it was not completed but people have completed the work of making toilets in nearby schools.
I mean, the government, the people, the government, all want to work for the country.
Last month, we launched three public security schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short span of time.
There has been very little work from the point of view of public security in India, but due to these three schemes we are setting up a very big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people's security but we have to move forward.
Raksha Bandhan Festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolution together.
When I talk about my mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time I should say something for monsoon, many people have sent suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that you must talk about Mann Ki Baat for monsoon.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also have to enjoy hot cotton, sown, corn and tea in the rain.
But at the same time, the way the sun's rays give life, the rain empowers our lives.
The water of the village remains in the village, the water of the city remains in the city, it should be our resolve and we should try to stop the water.
And the rain water stops and if the land is recharged then the problems of the year are solved.
I always tell the people that if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and go to see Mahatma Gandhi's house then there is a tank inside his two hundred-year-old house in which there was a direct arrangement for rain water to go there.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was kept in the house by collecting rain water, at that time too such a care was done.
We can also do it.
We all have to undertake tree plantation and plantation in this rainy season through social organizations and youth in large numbers.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience and a successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant, put an old soil clock in the bag of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month then it will also run.
I also tell the farmers that instead of planting fences on the edge of your farm, you should plant trees.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the days of rain, diseases spread a lot.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria start developing and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
The request for drinking pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of cases we will do will be away from us.
Water should be required, rain should also be there but it should also be avoided from disease.
Friends, Now we have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities capable of living.
In the same way, there should be a country that can equalize the world.
In the country, there should be a smart city that can equalize the world and on the other hand the poorest of the country should have their homes to live. And the houses that have electricity, water, toilets and the school should be arranged to read in the nearby areas.
When India celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big scheme has been started.
I am confident that all these schemes will help in bringing about changes in urban life.
I myself am connected to you all through social media, many new ideas are meeting you people and good information about the government is also available.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village also touches our hearts.
You know that a daughter Bachao-Beti Padhao program is on behalf of the government.
But when the programme of the government becomes a person, a society and a village, then how much increases its strength.
In the past, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village of Haryana took a very fun initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
The most in Haryana.
But when the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village of Haryana turns this way, it is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
So I express my happiness.
But I have also been inspired by this incident and that is why I urge you to post your daughter with your daughter and your daughter as well as your daughter.
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao with her will write a tagline that empowers this idea and will write the best line and it can be in any language, whether English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspirational tagline I will be from your daughter Selfie and I will retweet to you.
In a way, we can transform this into a mass movement.
The work that Bhai Sunil started from village Bibipur in Haryana and should move forward together and I urge you to post the sleeve-with-defector.
So my best wishes to you all in this rain and enjoy the rain.
Make our country green.
Not for one day, you will continue the practice of Yoga.
You see, you'll see its benefits.
Make it a part of your life, sure you do it.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere and send photographs.
The country and the world will know how much diversity our country has.
I felt that there was very little about handicraft.
We have to reach the world, to reach India's features all around.
And we have a simple medium, we must reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet the next time for the sake of the next mind.
In a light atmosphere, 130 crore people used to listen to many things, repeat and sometimes they used to become inspiration for themselves.
You can imagine it's been the middle period, how has happened
Perhaps, this wasn't a lifeless program.
There was a lifetime in this programme, there was an attachment to the mind and the attachment of the hearts. And because of this, the time that took place between me was very difficult.
Every minute I was missing something and when I talk about the mind, I'm probably mine, the word is mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the male is yours, the supreme is yours.
was feeling a vacancy
But this Sunday waited a lot
Well, I've got the chance.
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said they ' re missing the point of mind
Sometimes I feel that this is a journey of harmony with myself.
This is my vital journey to adultery
My quiet interaction with you for me was a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath under the leadership of the election
Most people have drawn political meanings from it
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way, I went to meet me,
I will not tell you any more today, but I will definitely do this thing that the vacancy that was due to this shortcoming of mind, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given the opportunity to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I ' ll ever discuss it too .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I am constantly feeling in your words.
The letters that come for the matter of mind, which are received inputs are completely different from the routine government functioning.
In a way , your letter also becomes a cause of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes the cause of energy .
Sometimes, I do some of your words to articulate my thought process.
People keep in front of the challenges faced by the country and society, then tell them solutions as well.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is expressing his resentment towards dirt but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone discusses the environment then he feels the pain, but at the same time he also tells the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate those strengths and talent, to provide opportunities, to implement it.
It also shows that in the progress of the country, all 130 crore Indians want to join with the strength and activism and I would definitely say that in the matter of mind, I have such letters, so many telephone calls, so many messages, but the element of the complaint is very low and somebody has asked for it, so one thing has not come to me in the last five years.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how joy my heart will have, how much energy will I get.
You have brought me, you have placed me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Let's move forward with this spirit of mind
When the emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to the political realm only, the politicians were not limited, till the bars of jail, the movement was not reduced.
In the emergency, every citizen of the country felt that something has been snatched away from him.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a very big election campaign, from the rich to the poor, all the people were happy to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its significance, its emerging effects are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted.
This number may seem very common to us, but if I say by the world, if we leave China, more people from any country of the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The number of voters in India is more than the population of the whole of Europe .
It indicates the vastness and extension of our democracy .
2019 Lok Sabha elections were the world's largest democratic elections in history so far
You can imagine how large wealth and manpower must have been required to conclude such elections.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees have become possible by day and night hard work
Where nearly 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces performed their obligations to successfully fulfil this great democracies of democracy, 20 lakh policemen from different states also laboured.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more than the last time the voting took place.
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh EVMs (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big item
All this was done so that it could be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, polling station was built for just a female voter.
Polling station at the highest height in the world is also in India
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Safti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is another fact that is proud in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men
Polling percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today record 78 (Seventy Height) are women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth several times, don't book, I urge you to give books instead of flowers in welcome welcome.
Since then , people have been giving books in abundance .
However, I did not get a lot of time, but during the migration, I got the chance to read some of his stories again.
His stories include the mood of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his written addiction, my mind itself went on economic inequalities in the society
This story of God and the poor family of the landlord learns that if you are not careful, then when does the effect of bad co-operation go, it is not known.
The second story, who touched my heart, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, so mature at that young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandmother with a scream from the fair, in the truth, human sensitivity reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because there is a very big truth in life, the child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, the girl became Amina.
That ' s the night of Puss
This story saw a living picture of a poor farmer ' s irony of life
Even after the destruction of his crop, the turmeric farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold.
Although these stories are about a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading them, I felt a different kind
When it is talking about reading, in a media, I was reading about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled between the dense forests of Idukki.
P.K. Murlidharan, teacher of primary school here and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was also a time when books were brought here by filling in the kitchen and loading on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people from every age group participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time and replace the book in your daily route.
You will actually enjoy a lot and write on the Narendra Modi App that all the listeners of the mind will also be able to know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that people of our country are thinking about issues that are not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
Water is very important in our culture
Give your blessings like your mother , and rain upon us your grace .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from the rains throughout the year are saved in our country .
I am confident that we will also solve this crisis with the strength, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty-two crore people with public participation, manpower, just like other problems.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water paramount
This will facilitate faster decisions on all matters related to water .
A few days ago I tried to separate something
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanchs across the country to the village head
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save water drops of rain, to convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha, to discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month millions of people in thousands of Panchayats have performed labour .
People in the village resolved to accumulate one drop of water
Today, in Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a sarpanch.
Listen, the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katkamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us all the message, my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
People there, once again are ready to play their active role for water conservation
My best wishes to all the village heads, all the Sarpanchs, for their activity.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the initiative of water conservation
In a way, it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in competition to build water temples in their villages.
As I said, collective efforts can have big positive results.
There can be no forum to deal with water crisis all over the country
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country, in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that's water saving, water conservation
The drainage lines in Punjab are being cured
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The construction of tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) of Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabir Dham, Rajasthan, there has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive Nag Nadhi.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on rainwater harvesting together.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving hard, we can make the impossible even possible.
When people will join, water will survive
Today through Mann Ki Baat I am requesting 3 people from the countrymen
My first request is that the people of the country should make cleanliness a mass movement, and initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Together we resolve to save every drop of water and I am confident that water is the offering given to God, water is the form of Paras.
They used to say before that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
I say, water is transparent and through the touch of water, new life is built.
Start a awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell about water related problems, as well as propagate water saving methods
I especially urge the celebrities of different regions to lead the innovative campaigns for water conservation.
Whether it is the film world or the sports world, our media partners, people belonging to social organizations, people belonging to cultural organisations, everybody should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake the society, join the society, join the society
You see, we'll see changes in front of your eyes
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the protection of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you, to share those traditional methods of water conservation
If any of you had got the opportunity to go to the birthplace of Porbandar and worshipped Bapu, then there is another house behind the house of worshipped Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and there is still water in it and there is a system to stop rain water, then I always used to say that those people who go to the Kirti temple must see that water tank.
Let us inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShaktiHashtag
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude to you for one more thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, with the activeness of Yoga Day, with emotion, three-four generations of one family came together and celebrated Yoga Day.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come for the healthcare.
Everyone in every corner of the world, if a yoga lover welcomes him as soon as the sun emerges, then there is a complete journey of sunrise.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from A gyms to the tropical desert, from villages to cities, wherever possible, yoga was not only done at all places but also organized collectively.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known celebrities, general citizens from many countries of the world showed me how they celebrated yoga in their respective countries.
That day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures this .
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Should not he be honored by recognizing such a service
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce the Prime Ministers Awards to contribute excellently to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019.
This award has been given to those organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the promotion of yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several Institutions and Training Courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roy of Italy who started all Yoga International and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in itself .
If this is a topic related to yoga, can Indians stay behind in it
Bihar Yoga School, Munger was also honored, for the last several decades, Yoga has been dedicated to him.
It is a very important journey for me to join your ideas .
Let's keep meeting, keep talking
Keep listening to your feelings, keep absorbing, keep understanding.
Sometimes I try to live those emotions.
Be your blessings
You're my inspiration, you're my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the matter of mind - let's also fulfill the responsibilities of life
I ' m going to meet again next month to talk about the mind
Thank you very much to me.
This season is also of heat on one side, and there is a lot of joy.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Talk of mind, December 2014
I have done a special one-hour programme and I have seen that there was no programme of the government's evils, there was anxiety and I believe that in a way there was a struggle to get out of the problem and there was an atmosphere of good discussion. The government's responsibilities have also been sensitized.
Have you ever thought
imagine
If this drug money goes to the terrorists
If terrorists buy arms from these money ,
And there will be a terrorist in the breasts of my country .
My country's youth will be martyred
Have you ever thought about the killing of a mother's red, the life of the mother of India, the living for the country, the bullet in the chest of the soldier, isn't it so
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their moral progress with our children
Modi ji are not tired
One month is very long .
Many incidents occur in the country and the world .
You all celebrated Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are those who keep filling up their lives from time to time, be it poor or rich, be it the village, be it the city, the festival has its own importance in everybodys lives.
Sometimes we think that the people are useless, people have nothing to do, our country is like this.
I am talking about my mind and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking. Our country is not such that people of our country are not such.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead and the governments are far behind.
And when I feel that perhaps the governments are very important to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I am seeing that these youths are committed to do something especially in India, are inspired and are exploring opportunities.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one khadi cloth.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a khadidhari . But I got information from Khadi stores that about 100 per cent handread and Twenty - five per cent sales increased in a week .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from 2nd October compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness. Someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of a mass movement.
There are a lot of expectations and should also be there.
And I am seeing a good result, cleanliness is now being seen in two parts.
An old filthy filthy filth is a government system. What will the people sitting in the government take for it
There is a big challenge , but you can ' t run away from the responsibility .
All the governments have to take steps for this responsibility because the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in this .
But the other aspect, which is very enthusiastic, joyful and satisfactory. The common man has started feeling that let's quit the previous thing.
We will not distinguish the new dirt .
I am from Satna, Madhya Pradesh, somebody has done Shri Bharat Gupta, they have sent a mail on my MyGov.
He was going to visit his railway. He said his own experience. He said that Saheb used to go to the railway earlier, this time also went to the Railways, but I am seeing that people in every passenger in the railway keep eating, throwing papers and papers. Nobody threw it, not only that, he used to find that there is a dustbin in the coach, put garbage in it.
And when we saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , they collected their waste in the corner itself .
It was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji for delivering this information to me .
But I am seeing this that the most effect has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families discuss that if our child eats chocolate somewhere then he takes the paper immediately .
I had just seen someone in the social media that someone had written. Today's my hero. And in today's hero, he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We will not make any difference to the filth .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed and somebody gets to beat them immediately.
I consider this auspicious sign .
One good thing is that those who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life meet.
Someone talks about cleanliness, some talk about education, some talk about social reforms.
Someone is discussing that our family life is getting destroyed .
I think that if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the Government about his own interests .
But I see a big change .
They talk about their selfishness, talk of taking some or the other responsibility related to society.
When I see these things connected, I feel that we are moving forward towards a very good transformation.
If my poor family is not sick , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he is healthy then he will work, earn and run the family.
And that is why my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we can do better service to the poor or not we cannot do dirt, it is also the best for the poor.
I have also seen that those who are working in this area are sending me their success stories .
But I found out two things from my government .
After my saying the officers of our H . . . Ministry felt that we should also do something .
And the officers together made a plan .
See how the changes in the government begin , is an example .
One , he decided that if he wants to go to the technical education then he has planned to give him special scholarship by favoring such a thousand good special - abld child .
I congratulate all these officers of the department for their ideas .
I got the opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I lived in the midst of the dead soldiers for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because of them, we are able to celebrate Diwali, so I went between them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they live in.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The youth of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity somebody gets ready to do any courage to protect us by betting life .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had got an opportunity to take a tea and drink programme from the youth, young students, youngsters and sportspersons of our country.
I got a new energy .
His zeal and zeal I was seeing that our systems and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but instead of complaining, they were talking about doing something more with zeal and zeal.
For me, the programme for tea and drinks was very inspiring for these players.
Towards one thing I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say it with my mind.
And I am confident that the countrymen have faith in my words and I believe in my intentions.
But today again I want to repeat it from my side .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your chief servant, this is the Artificial of Feth for me.
This is my committee that the money that the poor of India has gone out should come back.
Whatever the way, what the system is, there can be differences in it.
And it is natural in democracy , but on the basis of my understanding and information I have , I assure you that we are on the right path .
Today, nobody knows, nobody knows, neither the government nor the previous government knew how much money is out.
Everyone keeps describing different statistics in their own way.
I don't want to complicate these figures, my commitment is that it is two rupees, five rupees, millions and billions of rupees.
And I assure you there will be no dearth of my efforts .
Nothing will be done .
Just keep your blessings.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do, I will continue to do it.
I assure you of this .
I have a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even though I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this kind of feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter in your mind .
I agree with his suffering .
When I will talk about the next mind, I will surely discuss this drug, this drug mafia and the big crisis that can cause Indias youth wealth.
If you have some experience in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved the children of this addiction, if there are some ways of saving, if any government visitor has played a good role, if you give me such information then I will convey to the countrymen and we will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should go on this path due to the frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling the topics in which the Government comes to the forefront .
But how long will we keep things hidden .
I ' m also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that give us suggestions, give them on the face book, give them on Twitter, send e-mails.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have this, what they do.
Your point is right .
This facility is not with everyone .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind then you will listen to me on the village-village radio, then you will send a letter of mind, Akashwani, Parliament Road, New Delhi, if you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because active citizens are the largest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you're very active.
For the sake of my mind, you should also connect your mind.
Perhaps you must write a letter .
I will try, then talk to you next month.
I will try, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m facilitating to reach you .
Slowly cold is starting .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijaya Dashmi.
I extend my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Vijaya Dashmi.
I will try, if possible, I will either talk to you once a month or twice a month.
I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will be Sunday and the time will be at 11 in the morning, you will also be comfortable and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in delivering my mind to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijaya Dashmi celebrates this festival is a festival of victory of goods on evils.
But a gentleman, Ganesh Venkatadari, sent me a mail, he said that in Vijaya Dashmi, we resolve to end ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for his suggestion.
Everyone must think of defeating the evils in their own way, but as a nation, I believe that on the auspicious occasion of Vijaya Dashmi, we will resolve this on the occasion of Vijay Dashmi to liberate all of us from the dirt and to achieve victory by eliminating the dirt.
Tomorrow I had said one thing in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their video in social media while cleaning themselves and they will invite and nine people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of Khadi is very natural.
You know that our scientists successfully used to reach Mars at least cost, successfully done it.
There is no shortage of strength, only we have forgotten our power.
They have forgotten themselves.
I recall that Swami Vivekananda ji used to say one thing, Swami Vivekananda always used to tell one thing.
Once the child had gone with Sherni, she had now grown up.
He said what are you doing.
You're a lion.
They have made me big.
Look at my voice, see the way of my conversation.
So lion said that let's show who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and told him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as he woke up from within, he recognized himself, he also began to scream a lion between the sheep.
The essence within him arose.
Swami Vivekanand ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power within 1.
We need to identify ourselves.
We need to identify the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekananda ji had said, we will walk with our right identity, we will be successful and our nation will be successful.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps that was a very emotional, inspiring event of my life.
Paramatma has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of all the nation.
Later, I was so emotional that I used to separate Olympics for Special Abeld Children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come and their parents used to come and I went myself.
And that is why I liked to share with you all the suggestions that I have received.
One story gives me more attention.
You knew why you did not tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we are not standing ourselves, we will not be able to show the way.
We will not be able to catch the finger and run.
We have to start walking and I am confident that we are capable of walking around 1.
People send big interesting suggestions that I have received for a few days.
Some people have said that when they start small industries, the process of registration should be easier.
I will definitely inform the government for him.
Some people have sent me by writing that children should teach skill development from class II.
Someone has written to me that there should be a dust bean within every hundred meters, if there is a arrangement of cleanliness then.
Some people have written to me that the pack of polythene should be banned.
Many suggestions are sending me.
I tell you already that if you send me a true incident anywhere, which will inspire me, inspire the countrymen, if such true incidents send me with evidence then I will definitely talk to the people of the country when I have touched my mind.
All this is the only intention of interacting with me. Come together, let us serve our mother India.
We take the country to new heights.
As soon as you come to mind, I will definitely talk to you in the future.
I have told you the things that have come in my mind today.
Whenever I meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 a.m. but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will continue.
If you want to say something after listening to me, you must deliver me, I would like to.
I loved you all today and the radio is such a simple medium that I can reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest of the poor, because the strength of my country is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers and sisters and youngsters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
The country will move ahead with your trust.
I believe.
I believe in your power so I believe in the future of India.
Starting the talk of the mind is filled today
10 days ago, India-Mother lost their brave sons
These heroes, we spent ourselves in protecting 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept them together all night and day.
In Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country, and people's minds, shocks and resentment are there.
Condolences have emerged around the martyrs and their families
I salute all the brave sons of the country who have sacrificed their lives in the protection of Mother India.
The challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget all casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace , where they have shown marvellous capabilities , the attackers have also worked to respond in their language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack .
The army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational words of their families have come out through the media have further strengthened the spirit of the entire country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, also inspires us all in this hour of sadness.
They said , They will send their second son to fight against the enemies , and they will come to fight .
The whole country is saluting Meena ji's indomitable courage of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagat Singh Pur in Odisha
He has also taken a pledge to join his only son RP
When the body of the martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in the tricolor reached Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army
The tongue of this innocent today reflects the spirit of children and children of India.
Such sentiments are being seen in the houses of our brave, mighty martyrs.
There is no exception in our one brave martyr, his family is not exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
What is patriotism, for what is sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old incidents of history.
In front of our eyes, these are the livelihoods and this is the cause of inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long time since independence, the water memorial waiting for all of us is going to end.
The curiosity, eagerness of the countrymen is very natural about this.
On the Narendra ModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty, Karnataka, has expressed his happiness on the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was surprised and painful that there was no National War Memorial in India.
A memorial where the bravery stories of brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be decorated.
I decided that there should be such a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has become ready in such a short time.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will dedicate this national military monument to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi i. e. the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present just near it, this is a new memorial.
I am confident that going to the National Military Memorial for the countrymen will be like going to a pilgrimage site.
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the nation's gratitude to the soldiers who sacrificed the highest after independence.
The design of the monument shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concentration of the National Soldier Memorial is focused on our concentrative firecrackers i. e.
The brightness of the Amar Chakra, the symbol of the immortality of the martyr soldier
The second Circle is of the bravery cycle that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
This is a gallery where the bravery of the soldiers on the walls has been decorated .
After this, the resignation cycle shows the sacrifices of Circle soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice for the country are written in gold letters .
After this the defence cycle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of the soldiers and convincing the citizens of the country that every moment the soldiers are deployed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the identity of the National Military Memorial will be built as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude, to research them.
Here is the story of the sacrifices who have made their lives for the country , that we may live , so that the nation may be safe and prosperous .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country in words.
In October last year, I also got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our views under which we believe that the country should be grateful to men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Army Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go there you must share your pictures on social media so that others get inspiration from it and they are also eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, your thousands of letters and commends for the matter of mind, I keep getting to read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your commendation, I came to my notice a very interesting comment from the Spirit of Heaven Mukhopadhyay ji.
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then he was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that on March 3, Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also.
And he further writes that these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds that have enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way to pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand .
These two great securities have not enhanced the name of Jharkhand but the whole country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality to guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British were hiding, very cleverly caught them when they were asleep
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
Because the British who created such a great empire were afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had shaken English rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows
Actually, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people is heavy on the power of arms.
Lord Birsa Munda not only fought the British for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
They did all this in their little life .
In the darkness of the deprived and the deprived , shining like the sun .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed her at a young age of 25
The sons of Bharat Maa like Birsa Munda have happened in every part of the country.
Perhaps there would be a corner of India that no one has contributed to this war of independence for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, bravery and sacrifice did not reach the new generation.
If, personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us understand our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country big institutions.
Jamshedji Tata was a true vision, who not only saw India's future but also laid its strong foundation
He knew well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only this, he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 29.
as you all know that this day comes only once in 4 years
Easy, peaceful personality rich, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders in the country.
The record of presenting the most budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai
Morarji Desai made a skilled leadership of India at that difficult time, when there was a threat to the democratic tactics of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in the movement against emergency to protect democracy
For this he had to pay heavy prices even in old age .
The government of that time arrested him and put him in jail
But when Janata Party won elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
The 44th Constitution Amendment was brought during his tenure .
This is important because the 42nd Amendment brought during Emergency was repeated in which there were other provisions to reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, which used to transgress our democratic values.
Like 44th Amendment provides for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislatures in newspapers
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment also provided that the fundamental rights received under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be abusive even during the emergency.
For the first time, such arrangements were made that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President will announce the emergency, as well as it was decided that the period of emergency can not be extended to more than six months at one time.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which democracy was murdered in 1975 by implementing the emergency could not be repeated in the future.
His invaluable contribution to maintaining the glory of Indian democracy, the coming generations will always remember.
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, this time, like every year, there was a lot of eagerness among the people about the Padma award.
Today, we are moving towards a New India, we want to respect those who are doing their jobs at the grass-root level at an exemplary pace.
We are bringing positive changes in the lives of others in different ways on the strength of our hard work
In fact, he is a true worker, who lives in public service, social service and above all these selflessness in the national service
You must have seen when the Padma award is announced , people ask who is this
In a way, I consider it a very big success because these are those people who are not on the front page of T.
They are far from the world of brightness, but these are people who do not care about their name, believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : He won the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita in a way .

The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being self-sacrifice, it is difficult to get the example of the work done for the upliftment of Divyang women, by establishing an institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the pious work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, the farmer of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, is very inspiring.
He has presented an example in making women empowerment and farming profitable
Kisan Chachi linked 300 women from their area to Self Help Group and motivated them to make economically self-reliant
He trained the women of the village in addition to farming and other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with farming and my countrymen, perhaps this is the first time that 12 farmers have received Padma awards in the Padma awards given this year.
Normally , very few people belonging to the agricultural world and very few people who have made direct farming have come to the list of Padmashree .
This is a changing picture of India.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Today, wherever I am going in the country, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana PM-JAY.

Brothers and sisters, About twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change is coming in the lives of the poor
If you all know any poor person who is unable to treat with lack of money , tell him about this scheme .

There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for students .
All the students, their teachers and parents can see the recording of this programme on YouTube, so best wishes to all my exam warriors for the coming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is no talk of India and it cannot be a matter of festival.
There is hardly a day in our country which has no significance and no festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture
A few days later the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday then its special significance is spread in our minds and temples .
He discussed many topics and his confidence was really inspiring .
When one of them was talking to the enlightened youth during the interaction, he said, "I am a stage artificial, I mimicry in the programmes of entertainment, then I asked whom do you mimicry"
So he said that I mimicry the Prime Minister
So I showed them a little bit and it was very surprising for me, so they did the entire mimicry of the way I talk to them in the matter of mind and the mimicry of the mind.
I am very happy to hear that people not only listen to the mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really very impressed by the power of that disabled young man
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through the Mann Ki Baat program has been a unique experience for me.
Through radio I am in a way from millions of families every month .
Many times I feel like talking to you all, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone, you have considered me a part of your family.
It ' s a very pleasant feeling for me

Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji of Shri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka was not among us.
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveswar has taught us Kayakve Kailas i.e. performing his obligations while working hard, the residence of Lord Shiva is like being in Kailash Dham.
His fame was as a scholar who had wonderful grip on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He put his entire life in the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The welfare of the farmers in every way, it was a priority in Swami ji's life.
Siddhaganga Math was regularly organizing animals and agricultural fairs .
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of the supreme God.
In 2007, on the occasion of the Centenary Celebrations of Sri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji, our former President Dr. A.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem to worshipped Swami ji on this occasion .
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the mission of Sri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji and Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
Once again, I pay my respects to such a great man
On January 25, the EC was the foundation day, celebrated as National Voters Day.
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are organised in India and it is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission.
In our country, there is no obligation to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, is a registered voter, gets the opportunity to vote.
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things .
In view of a voter, the entire team of EC employees goes to a far-flung area and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that young people will use their vote in the 21st century Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they ' re going to be part of the decision process in the country
It is time to connect the dreams of ourselves with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as voters if they are eligible for voting.
It is my duty to vote together - these feelings should grow inside us.
For any reason in life, if you can not vote, then there should be a big pain
Sometimes there should be an error in the country .
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to make the people aware by campaigning about whether we are together to register water or vote on the day of polling.
I hope a large number of youth will be registered as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is Bahuratna-Vasundhara
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
You know that many such rooms, buildings were closed since independence within the Red Fort.
The closed rooms of the Red Fort have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and I.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the aroma of our glorious history is settled.
The words of the heroes of our freedom struggle inspire us to go inside history on the verge of the museum.
At this place, the British rule had prosecuted the brave sons of Bharat Maa Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was witnessing memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Mandir, the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap and hat.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the hat in the museum, so that people coming there also see that hat and inspire him to patriotism.
Indeed , the bravery and patriotism of his heroes requires to reach frequently separately to the new generation .
Just a month ago on December 30 I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised, because there is this tradition only on August 15.
This was the occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and efficient organization
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle
Let's go to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with desperate slogans
For many years, it has been demanding that the files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember the day when all the family of Netaji came to the Prime Minister's residence.
We shared a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Whether it is 26, Alipur Road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or it is a revolutionary temple
If you come to Delhi you must go to see these places .
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, and that too, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of connecting people with the same way Netaji had a very deep relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations, weekly news bulletins were also broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The programmes to be broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also gave great strength to our freedom fighters .
A sight art museum has also been built in this revolution temple .
This has been an attempt to tell Indian art and culture very attractively .
There are 4 historical events in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works three centuries old .
The museum demonstrates the excellence of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Verma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to go there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
Now you ' re thinking about talking about art here and I ' m talking to you to see the best works of Gurudev Tagore .
You have to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician .
But I want to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not name most of his works .
He believed that the person who saw his painting himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in the painting from his point of view
Their paintings have also been displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you're going to see their paintings in the revolution temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have suggested goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
There was such a saint - Sant Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
Saint Ravidas ji's two are very famous
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in caste, which is a caste of ketan, radas can not add man unless the caste is covered with the stem of banana, then the leaves under the leaves and nothing comes out under the leaves and finally, but the whole tree ends, the same way man has also been divided into castes and there is no human being.
They used to say that if God is actually in every human being, then it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his lifetime
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of labour prestige to the world .
He used to say that if your mind and heart are sacred then God lives in your heart in Kathauti .
The messages of Sant Ravidas ji have influenced every section, every section of people, be it the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or Meerabai, all of them were their followers.
I once again bow to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and go beyond the sky and think - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and the message given specially to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Innumerable young scientists of the country contribute to our space programme.
We are proud of the fact that the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space today.
The Kalam set launched by our students on 24th January
Sounding Rockets made by university students in Odisha have also made many records.
The more space missions have been launched since independence to 2014, the more space missions have started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We will soon register India's presence on the moon through Handryan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect our lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all of them are getting a lot of help from space technology.
NAI devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their safety and economic growth.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services
About 40 lakh households of 23 states have been geo-tagged in the House for All i. e.
Along with this, about three and a half crore properties under MNREGA were also geo-tagged.
Our satellites are a symbol of the growing power of the country today
It has a big contribution to our better relationship with many countries of the world .
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also given development to our neighboring friendly nations.
Through its extremely Competitive Launch Services, India launches satellites not only from developing countries but also from developed countries.
For children the heavens and stars are always attractive .
Our Space Programme gives children an opportunity to think and move ahead of the boundaries that were considered impossible so far.
This is a vision for our children to look at the stars as well as to inspire the search of new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the players who have played and this time all young and young players have come in front of the players in India.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports is strong, that is, when our base is strong, our youth will be able to demonstrate the best of their capabilities in the country and the world.
This time players of every state in Khelo India have performed well at their own level.
The life of many players who win the medal is inspiring .
They live in a parking shade with their family
At the same time, Sonali, the captain of the under-21 female Kabadi team of Maharashtra, is a resident of Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged golden talent .
It is often seen that daughters do not get such a boost in sports like kabaddi .
Despite this Sonali chose the kabaddi and performed excellently .
Asansol's 10-year-old Innovative Show, Khelo India Youth Games is the youngest gold medal winner
Akshata Baswani Kamati, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, won gold medal in weightlifting
He credited his victory to his father and his father is a farmer in Belgaum .
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is a New India for the resolution of Youth Power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling that the creation of New India is not only contributing to the people of big cities but also the youth and children coming from small towns, villages and towns, young sporting talents and their contributions are also very big.
