I have said three things to use the space, if you have done three things then you will not have a good thing, you will definitely use it.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Then go to another place and take three-four days there.
This will give you the opportunity to learn a lot.
I also hope that whenever you go there, take some photographs with me.
Have you seen a new thing
Thousands of years ago, he launched a campaign to enter their temples and entered the temple.
We are truly fortunate that in every age the great men have born in us to remove the mischief of our society.
In other words, "Shram Hi Shiva", I often call "Shreemab Jayate".
My best wishes, thank you.
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, he was also declared by the British as the night and when in 1919, the English were divided into Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath was one of those personalities and great men who had adverse effects on his voice against the English government and during this period a small child of 12 years.
The sight of the Jaliwanawalabagh massacre was awakened in the mind of a small child playing in the body-buggy in adolescence and in 1919, the 12-year-old daughter Bhagat is the source of our inspiration - Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Before this day, on March 23, Bhaggata Singh, his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru were presented by the British Government and everyone knew that on 23rd March, there was no fear of death in the face of Bhagata Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru that day Bharat Mata (Maa Bharati).
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are the source of inspiration today.
We cannot describe the lyrics of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
It can be a good beginning for India.
In 2022, 75 years of India's independence will be completed.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
We can do this in our daily life.
Brothers and sisters, Look how much interest is in the minds of a student of eleventh grade.
There is a lot of confusion in his mind by looking at the waste.
I recall that this is a good sign.
I want the people of 150 crore people to be aware of cleanliness.
Once we have become a nation of dissatisfaction, we will start doing something against cleanliness.
It is a good thing that the Gayatris are spreading their television and also suggesting me and also telling them that he has failed in many attempts.
I know some youngsters who have carried out such campaigns.
The biggest problem is that we don't know about such incidents around us, even if we talk openly about it.
Whoever feels depression does not say anything because he remembers himself ill.
If he does not want to stay alone with you then you will not let that happen.
This is the best way.
It will be the third year.
Millions of people should celebrate Yoga Festivals.
If you want to give some suggestions regarding the third International Day of Yoga, you must be my guide through my mobile app.
The poems or poems that can be communicated in Yoga must be understood as people can easily understand.
I also want to say one thing to mothers and sisters because today there has been a lot of discussion about health.
Just a few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The workforce that is working women in our country, their numbers are increasing day by day, the partnership is increasing.
However, he has some special responsibility.
Earlier, working women were given 12 weeks of maternity leave during their period of marriage, now it has been extended to 26 weeks.
There are probably two-three countries in the world which are ahead of us in this direction.
India has taken a very big and important decision for these sisters.
In Narendra Modi App, through Twitter, in the letter..
Whether it is a fight against poverty or to get rid of illness, to connect with the world, to spread knowledge or information, technology and science have created a special place for itself.
It is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful inspiration of PSLVs.
This is an important achievement in the field of defence and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this capacity.
Both persons have worked very carefully and they have developed houses that can save homes in such risks.
In the last few days, our country has received a lot of support for the 'Lucky Fertilizer Scheme' and 'DG Financial Business Scheme'.
More than four thousand businessmen have received awards of Rs.
I understand and encourage you with great enthusiasm.
A young friend of Maharashtra, a graduate student, he is also extending his experiences about how the use of RuPay Card, e-Alet etc. in his family and how much joy is being provided by him.
And how important a prize of one lakh rupees is for him, but he has now adopted this work as a campaign and inspires others to do this.
I urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country, and those who have received the awards in this Lakhi Building Scheme, DG-Dhan Business Scheme, to take the leadership of this movement, be it its ambassador or Ambassador.
You are a kind of sacred.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service of the poor of my country.
We know that when a citizen of our country does some good work, the entire country feels a new energy, the confidence of the country increases.
We all welcomed the exhibitions that our Divyangs performed in Rio Paralympics.
This month, India lost Pakistan on the World Cup Cricket Field UNDER-20, organised this month, for the second time, as a world champion, has enhanced the pride of India.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of this achievement of our Divyang friends.
I am very grateful for your partnership.
Therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I am attracting my views towards both Mohans.
Today, when we are discussing the festival, India is preparing for another big festival.
And this is being discussed not only in India but also all over the world.
We have reviewed his entire life, we have seen that in South Africa, he served the people of those communities who had been inclined to speak, and that was not a common thing at that time.
He served those farmers who were distinguished in Champaran.
He lived not in language but in his life.
I believe that even if 130 crore people have imagined about 130 crore people, 130 crore programmes will be there.
EA is the Nand Lal Bose whose art work is enhancing the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new introduction to the Constitution.
Once again, on the occasion of Gandhiji's 150th birth anniversary, I wish every Indian some or the other resolve.
Something should be done for the country, for the society and for others.
This will be the best, true and authentic activity for Bapu.
Friends, You must remember that for the last few years, we have been launching Swachhata Hi Seva across the country about two weeks before 2nd October.
This time on 2nd October, when we celebrate Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we not only dedicate him to open defecation free India but also laid the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic across the country.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering.
It means that water, food and energy are three kitchens in this world.
But the deaf people call the stone a kitchen.
The glory of food is very high in our culture.
Even we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
This is important especially for women and children because they are the foundations of our future in the society.
Nutrition is being converted into a mass movement in modern scientific ways across the country through POSHAN Abhiyan.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and magnificent manner.
One thing was brought to my sight.
This was a very good step that can be done in all the regions.
Friends, There are many such small things through which our country can fight malnutrition effectively.
Due to lack of awareness, the poor families and their families are also affected today.
The month of September will be celebrated as Nutrition Abhiyan across the country.
There was a period of translation and there was a small course in the ears of Bear Grills.
After this programme, many people are seen talking about the gym Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife.
I have already told you that you must visit North East India once in your life.
On 15th August, I urged you to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I had the opportunity to unveil a number of reports.
The number of tigers in India is now 2967.
But this is a New India, here we have achieved the goals a lot.
When I was unveiling the Tiger data, I remembered the Gir forest of Gujarat.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the residence of lions in the forests of Gir was connected.
But now we have to think about the sensitivity ahead of conservation.
We have to keep ourselves healthy and keep the country healthy.
I know that all these campaigns will also be smiling in the social media.
Let us move forward with a new enthusiasm, a new resolve and a new energy.
I will wait for your words and your opinions.
Come, let us all move towards fulfilling the dreams of our freedom fighters and fulfilling the dreams of Gandhiji: Swanta: Sukhai:
Let us move forward as a service to our joy.
Thank you very much, salute.
Whenever I announced this, many teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked me questions, suggested and discussed the problems.
The energy of the society is felt only during the festival.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the tests in a proper manner.
It seems that it is a question of life and death.
The exams that you are going to give will be tested for your reading throughout the year.
This is not the test of your life.
You have shown his experience, his knowledge and success.
Therefore, whenever the burden of this number stops us from going right.
Because it is generally a belief that if the students turn towards sports then their attention is lost.
I don't know whether it would be right or not, but I have realized that at such a time, it will be very beneficial to do the Deep Breathing.
No, no, take as much sleep as the body needs, which will not waste your time.
It will help in enhancing reading power.
Your concentration integration will increase.
You will feel satches.
Your skills will increase in a holistic manner.
Whenever I hold elections, I swept my throat.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Yeah, young friends, you have prepared for testing and I have tied you in my mind.
That's why I suggest that your parents don't have a burden on me too.
The Prime Minister said that in order to enhance every exam, one festival of exams should be done.
Thereafter, the test will never be done.
Let us move ahead with this mantra.
Mann Ki Baat provides me a very big opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes to Bahatu Bahu.
He said that he was standing near a temple storehouse.
Today, in a big day, the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes.
To say, two new schemes are going to be started.
Be it villages or cities, educational institutions or illiterates, how cash-free transactions can be made without cash. There has been an atmosphere of utility in this regard.
For this, the Government of India is going to launch the E-Payment Promotion Scheme for entrepreneurs and small entrepreneurs.
The scheme is aimed at encouraging consumers and encouraging traders.
The awards will be given to 15000 people every day.
This award will be a part of the scheme along with 30 crore people.
In the last few days, cash collections have increased from 200 to 300.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youth have made immense progress in the start-ups.
This digital development is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters, with new emotions and thoughts, with new technologies, with new systems, have to focus on this sector, but we have to be fully connected to the campaign to free the country from corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge the people to tell me their suggestions and their ideas before Mann Ki Baat every month.
When I saw these things, I would like to say that I divide them in three parts.
This law will also work in the coming days.
Whatever we have to do for the benefit of the country, for the welfare of the people is our priority.
As per the Investment Report, India is ranked third in the potential top economy 2016-18.
The participation of students in such a large number of board tests is concentrating on the fact that our children of Jammu Kashmir are committed to reaching new heights of development through education for the future of water.
Once I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm, I congratulate their parents, their friends, their teachers and the faces of all the villages.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time, I would like to recall the opinions of all those who have come to the fore for Mann Ki Baat.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, there is a lot of efforts to mislead you.
Their capabilities were identified.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I am confident that the resolves of 1. 25 billion people and all the coordinated efforts will establish this country as a new energy.
But corruption is so wide that some people still have no bad habits.
Some people still feel that the money of this corruption, the amount of black money, the amount of Rs.
They have taken uninterrupted paths to save their wealth.
It is a matter of sadness that they have also chosen the way to use the poor.
Some people are trying to save the wealth by misleading the poor and seducing them in their accounts.
There will be a lot of difficulty in the system that has been created in the Benami Property Act.
There is no problem for the people of the country, the government does not want it.
Appreciating the war against corruption and black money announced by Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh, he said, Your Majesty, my name can be Ashish.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village of Tirali Tehsil of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country in which there is a sense of service morale and sacrifice.
During the elections, I was talking about Cha and it was widespread throughout the world.
People from many countries of the world also learnt to talk about tea.
There was no festival, no festival, no festival, because there was some economic problems due to the closure of the boat.
Travelers also took it as a respect.
Bharat Maru and Daksa Parmar of Surat- They have contributed to the fight against corruption, against black money and the fight against EA through their marriage.
I bless the newly married Bharat and Dussehra and conversion of marriage to this great yajna to a new occasion.
Friends, you are my real soldier.
I am very well aware that all of you are active in this great work.
Once the poor people will bless you with the use of RuPay cards.
He told the common citizen that he would be free from all concerns.
I believe that if all the youth of India are engaged in this work then it will not take much time.
Within a month, we can stand before the world as a new modern India.
We will take forward this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money.
People from far flung places will realize that the Indian people are the other names of the festival and this is natural.
Deepawali's Deepawali is the festival of going towards the light of Deepawali, which is the shadow of darkness in the society of Deepawali.
One thing we all know well that every place in India should go to the house of the richest and the poorest of the poor and on the occasion of Deepawali, every household will see the cleanliness drive.
I mean, the festival of Deepawali is going to be a source of inspiration from darkness to light for the world.
When we celebrate Deepawali, somebody stands in the house, somebody is engaged in protecting the summits of the Himalayas and somebody is protecting the airport.
Besides, I would like to say that along with the officers and soldiers, his family and his wives also sacrificed a lot.
In a way, the entire army is getting very good messages and I want to make you appy Diwali too.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Army are not only on the border but also on every field of life.
The need of the hour is to fulfil the hopes that the poor people of the country have created.
And in the 21st century there shall be darkness in the villages, and no more.
Sardar Saheb has given us a India and all of us have the responsibility to make it a better India.
The fundamental pillar of unity creates a strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb was not only a person in struggle but also a creative person.
On this Ekta Diwas, on October 1975, we will be committed to recalling Sardar Saheb and unity wherever we may be.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light in this series of Deepawali.
My dear countrymen, once again dedicate this Deepavali to the nation's soldiers.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
A few days ago, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri sector.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national power and knowing the truth, they have gone through the path of peace by dispersing themselves from such people.
But Harsh Vardhan, I also say that there is a huge value of the anger that the people of the country have in their minds.
This time, very few people will be aware of how this disabilities have shown in paralysis.
Moreover, I was surprised to note that those with disabilities who were in the fourth place and did not get any medal, they took less time than those with the Gold medal among the general category competition.
Congratulations to those who have done this work and those who have tried to do it.
I urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children.
Come, let us move with determination.
They have contributed themselves to the construction of about 9,000 toilets.
The common citizens and the common man of this country inspire me somehow.

He played an important role in bringing Gold to India in the Olympic Sports in 1928, 1932.
We know the name of all the cricket lovers brandmen.
It has become a source of inspiration for me to read these messages of people.
A senior Ajit Singh has written in the NarendraodiApp: You must tell yourself about the education and participation of daughters in sports, because they have won medals in Rio Olympics and honoured the country.
Thousands of people have almost illuminated such ideas.
We have not been able to display our hopes.
It has happened in some events that our sportspersons were not able to reach that level and only two medals were received in the list of medals.
But it is also true that in spite of not getting the medal, many players of India have shown a lot of good performance for the first time.
Something like this is connected to Tennis with Senia Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
There are many sportspersons, such as Aditya Ashoka, Auranginal, Atanu Das, whose exhibitions were good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
And if we shall do that which we have done, then shall we be reproached again.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, and to their students.
The contribution of teachers in our lives is always felt.
And there he was always a teacher.
Not only that, he always used to say, "The best teacher is the one inside whom the students never die.
You will also have a feeling like me.
Your teachers will change the perspective of all the teachers, their pride will increase.
It is our responsibility to increase the pride of teachers in society.
We all hope that the lives of our country, our society, our families and every person should be incomplete.
We are still living in a free India.
Therefore, on the occasion of Public Ganesh Festival, the Swarajya should move towards the Good Governance with this mantra of our rights.
Governance should be our priority.
Can we not propagate this message through public Ganesh Festival
Instead, why shouldn't we use the Ganesh statue built on the soil of village Pokhari
The statue built in the Plaster of Paris has an adverse effect on the environment.
Many more things have emerged with him.
I also urge you all - why don't we use the idol made of soil to brighten our ancient tradition
The destruction of Lord Ganesh.
Therefore, we are eligible to build a Ganesh that will create an interruption.
From the saints, from the sages, from the great men, we always get to learn something or the other.
I also congratulate the Friends of the Air Force for their contribution in the country's foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the responsibility of the Prime Minister but I am a man like you.
You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, an old woman running for pension, wishing to get rid of smoke and giving gas connections to the poor mothers, is not a small thing.
The feelings of mothers and sisters of this kind of crores of mothers and sisters are creating trust and strength for the future of my country.
Those who are trying to create peace in Kashmir by pushing these small children forward, they will have to be responsible before these children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and full of diversity.
In the form of a society, in the form of a society, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen and enhance the importance of unity, so that the country can brighten its future.
I believe in the strength of 1. 25 billion people.
Today, thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we used to think of Marudi but today there is a joy of rains and the news of floods is coming again.
Sometimes there are attacks of such diseases that we have to lead the whole life.
But if we beware, beware, beware, then the way to escape from it is easier.
Keep an eye on cleanliness, try to fulfil the vigilance and preserve the child.
We must understand that Dengu is the first attack in a prosperous area.
You must have seen the television, but sometimes we are encouraging ourselves to take steps to become aware of it.
In our country, about 3 crore women take birth every year, but some mothers are dying at the time of birth.
My doctors brothers and sisters cannot do this for the poor for 12 days in a year
In the Gita, Lord Krishna said, "Ashwatha: Sarvakanam", I am Ashwath among all trees.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there was a large number of travellers in the Ambaji Temple in Vadrava month.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan will understand how big it is.
This year, Gujarat has taken several projects such as floods, unity floods, martyr floods and planted crores of trees in the form of floods.
I cannot mention all the states, but they are a serpent of congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to go to South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit, there is a diplomatic policy on foreign travel, trade is discussed, security is discussed.
But what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet such dignitaries who have sacrificed their lives for equal opportunities for equality.
The Indians, but wherever they went, were ready to sacrifice their lives for those who had gone to that place.
Let us take pride in our Indians who have transformed our livelihood in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the industrialist Burma for giving me a message.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in India.

I can't do everything myself.
Just as people wish to know about Kedarnath, I can feel your efforts to emphasize positive things.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are completely different from the genetic government.
People have asked for something but I have not seen anything like this for myself in the last five years.
And, you have given me the opportunity to tell me again.
That is why the entire country has not only given the entire election for its own benefit but also for the protection of democracy.
With their hard work, this time more than the last time.
You will be surprised to know that the employees of the Election Commission had to travel there for two days.
The world's highest number of polling stations are also in India.
This centre is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahol-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Though these stories were about a hundred years ago, their relevance is still feeling the same.
After reading these things, I had a different feeling.
When the reading is going on, I would like to say that through some media I was studying about the library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.

A few days ago, I tried to do something different.

The familiarity of the National Army Memorial will be such a place where people will come here to get information about the great martyrs of the country, to give their gratitude and to explore them.

It is also a reflection of our ideas in which we believe that the country should express gratitude to those men and women police personnel who are untimely engaged in our security.
These two great personalities have brightened the name of not only Jharkhand but also the entire country.
The whole country is grateful to him for his contribution.

You will be surprised to know about the Tao Porchon-Linch of America.
I felt that how many changes have come in the lives of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to you all for this holy festival of Shivaratri.
I myself will also be a part of this election.
Honouring the healthy democratic tradition, the last day of the month of Mann Ki Baat May will be celebrated.
That is, in the month of March, in the month of April and May, after the election of all these three months, with a new confidence, I will start interacting with you again through Mann Ki Baat and talk to you for years.

Saint Ravidas is very famous.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.

He used to say that if the meaning of Man Changa to Kathauti me Ganga is sacred, then the Lord of yours is also living in your hearts.
The message of Saint Ravidas has affected every section of the society, be it the kings and queens of Chittor or be it Meeraba.

He was honoured with Padmashree from the beginning of this year.

Did we not get inspiration to hear about such achievements
The people of Prayagraj are very excited for Kumbh.
He had received the support and inspiration from Bapu in jail for so many years.
