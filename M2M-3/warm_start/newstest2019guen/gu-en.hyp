Did you read the serpent get joked
How can the Dussehra language of Sultan Mahmoud Gazni of Gazni be Sanskrit for the devotee of the Somnath Temple and for the common Indian
In fact, the research of the Historian of Delhi University, President Shanti Pandey, has made it clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
Now, when Shri Somnath Trust paid homage to Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai for the service of democracy, Sanskrit was only the language of the so-called high-level Brahmins, it was natural to have a simple question.
Pundit Gulam Passenger of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pundit, who speaks in such a simple Sanskrit, can also be understood by the rickshaw, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy uran before the publication.
The sacred uran is Sanskrit in his vision.
u Ran, i. e.
Not only reading himself in the school of Solapur, he is also among the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country who are counting the finger as high today.
However, Pandit ji does not seek to give a description of Sanskrit pundits in the US or other countries for his marketing.
The princes of Thailand are pundits of Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit recites itself there.
To learn Sanskrit from America, enthusiasts have to go to Bone University in Germany.
Besides the Banaras Hindu University in India , most of the universities also have the grandeur of the PHD of Sanskrit which is written in the language of that state itself .
In Gujarat, Sanskrit education is given only in Gujarat, but it should be remembered that education in Takshila and Nalanda Universities was done only through Sanskrit.
The practice of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, P. Shanta Pandey, has said that the Darbar language of Ghazni Sultan was not only Sanskrit but it has also recorded his money money in Sanskrit.
These coins have also been mentioned in the Sanskrit receipts of the uran and the creator of Sanskrit Panini being a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru said that a massive process in the vision of Mary Hindu has descended from the efficiency of Sanskrit language and sustainable power of Afghan and Pushtu language Sanskrit.
Now everyone accepts that not only Indian languages, but also the Indo-European languages have come down from Sanskrit.
One more surprising thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Chief Guest of the Constitution and members of some other Muslim and Southern Indian Constitution had proposed to make Sanskrit a national language of the country.
On 13th September, 1949, when English discussed the national language in the Constituent Assembly, Naib was among those who proposed the National Language to Sanskrit.
The day's discussion and the report published earlier in the National Herald of September 11, 1949 is estimated to be the brownness of Sanskrit language.
Even today, we have not been able to decide any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a official language in our Constitution, not a national language.
As per the calculations of 2011, only 24,821 people of the country have been Sanskrit as mother tongue.
The great Prime Minister of Sanskrit, Nehru had also spoken very respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
Sir Williams Johns said in the sal of Chhach 1874, how old is the Sanskrit language, but God knows its creation is marvellous.
He's full of Greek language, more opposite to Latin and more than both of them.
Nehru adds: I do not know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, from where he has died as a folk language.
Now, as a Sanskrit language prayer or a Parliamentarian, the language of taking oath as a member of Union Minister Smriti Irani is only.
We need to revive the year of Sanskrit and make it a live and folklore.
If Israel's dead language can be revived, Sanskrit is still a vibrant language.
To make it a folklore or to make a serious effort instead of moral efforts, it is only a matter of pride.
