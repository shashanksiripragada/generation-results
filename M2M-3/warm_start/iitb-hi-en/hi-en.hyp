Black box in your car
While the US road planners are struggling with lack of money to improve the damaged highway system, many people are looking at it in a small black box, which is fitted by the cleaning of your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile run by the motor driver and transmits that information to the officers, has now become an issue of a controversial effort for Washington and State Planning Office to revive the old system to financing US major roads.
Generally, boiling work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intensive debate and vibrant alliances.
You have met with Liberatorian Environmental Groups to gather support to allow the government to use these black boxes to drive miles, and perhaps drive the location - and then to prepare the tax bill to use this information.
The tea party is a deception.
The American Civil Freedom Association is also very worried about raising various types of confidential issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go to a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every miles fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor-drives have already taken black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is actually a compulsory thing for our country.
"This is not a matter of being elected by us or not, it is to say that Hassan Ekrata, who is the Executive Director of the South California Government Union, who is planning to start tracking every miles set by motor-drivers in California by 2025.
We are going to change the way to pay taxes.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost become bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes on gas pumps by American citizens.
Americans do not buy as much gas as before.
Now the car runs more than a mile in a gallon gas.
Federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18. 4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians avoid increasing one money in tax.
Transport policy expert Lee Munikh at Minesota University says, "Gas is not communicable at all.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run, it will work as the most logical option."
Wonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea is enjoying urban liberals, for example, taxes can be changed to change the mode of car running, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
The planners of California are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to fulfill the goals set in the ambitious global warming laws of the state.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Shuster (A-PA) also considers Black Box as the most viable long-term option.
In the Region Foundation, independent vendors are also in favor of paying per miles by the driver.
In the Region, the Vice President of the Policy, Adrian Mur said, "This is not just doing this which is going to the blind well."
People are paying more directly for the things they are getting.
This campaign has also been supported by two former US transport secretaries, who had blessed the Congress in their report in 2011 to move forward towards per-mile payment.
The US Senate had approved the test project of  90 million last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing those people who have to go to work daily or to go to the city, the leadership of the House ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving forward in this direction themselves.
It is the most interesting Organ, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Newada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York city is also moving forward in this direction.
Elinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And I-95 coalition, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), along with eastern seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support at all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly before, the drivers were very embarrassed to think that the government could monitor their every step.
Alauddin Khan, who guided strategic and performance management in the Navada Transport Department, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem.
This is not something that people wanted.
As soon as the test moved forward, the ACLU of Newada had warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert this device into full trekking device.
There is no need to develop a large, non-permanent technological infrastructure, which has to be spread imperatively to keep every person's daily departure records.
NEWADA is one of the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles daily the car is running, but it is not where and where it is going on.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
Looking for this technology, some state agencies were transported to the small California Startup, Tru Miles.
This firm was not originally in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay on the basis of their miles.
But the device that it is testing, the highway planners liked, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
Ryan Morison, Chief Executive Officer of True Miles, said, "If you do not track the speed and their place, they will be more interested in adopting this method.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are very few expensive and less interfering methods to do so.
In Organ, planners are using to give different options to drivers.
They can choose the device of GPS or GPS without.
Or you can not choose to take any device, but you can choose to pay the prescribed fee on the basis of average miles fixed by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to the concerned citizens by providing more facilities rather than less in the device.
In New York city, transport officials are trying to develop such taxing devices, which will also facilitate payment of parking meter fees, will provide payment insurance according to their drive, and will create a collection of actual time speed data from other drivers, which can be used to avoid motor-driver traffic.
The city planning document states, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to the participation due to the benefits received from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussions on payments according to miles are a big breakdown.
In the San Francisco Gulf region, the Metropolitan Transport Commission has said that Congress can easily deal with the problem of Diwali Highway Trust Fund by increasing gas tax.
The drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be charged additional one time or annual fees, whose vehicles do not use very much gas so that they pay their proper share.
Randy Rentsheller, director of the Commission's legislation and public affairs, said, "When it can be worked with Aspirin, what is the need for radical surgery for him.
If we do this then millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
Of course, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the late goods near him.
The police has submitted the final report of the investigation of death in the court.
It is known that on August 26, the police recovered the body of ahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Pass.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told in the interrogation that she has given this phone to her relative Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and he was a friend of the late ahid.
Ruhal went to bath in Jhelum with ahid after Namaz-e-umma on August 25.
ahid opened his clothes and kept all the things on the shore, while Ruhal went on the other side to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, ahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched ahid, but he did not get it.
On this, he picked up his mobile phones, watches and other things and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that ahid was drowned.
Police told the court that ahid's death has been drowned and it has also been confirmed in the post-mortem.
Of course, Ruhal has been detained under Section 404 to hide the facts and the luggage of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister, 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, who is known for Bunga-Bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very intelligence manner.
This disclosure has been made by his family friend Marthel Pollonko.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been the Prime Minister three times, has married former TV Anchor Francisco Pascal in his private chapel.

Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
However, he did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjode.
Both of them married about three weeks ago i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old woman from her was associated with Francisco Pascal.
In order to avoid kirkiri, Berlusconi had made the basis of loneliness behind his decision.
In the lower areas, the rain continued to stop between the eyes and the sun.
Along with this, cold wave has started in the whole plaintiff.

Asaram, who was lodged in jail for sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being presented as a dracula drinking children's blood, but the court rejected his demand to ban media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop the news about Asaram and said that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media that he was showing news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They filed a case against whom, but the bench was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter and said that they have more options.
Even before this, the court has rejected Asaram's demand to ban media coverage once.
Department officials claim that this is the case of the biggest TDS theft so far.
The group operator of the mall cut the TDS to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the money of TDS was deposited with itself.
On October 17, the exploration team from Mumbai had taken action with the Jaipur Exploration Team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of sealing the account was raided and surveyed on the group of this mall operator about 15 days ago.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupees to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and acting.
Officials investigating this matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, recovery will be taken by sealing the account.
Given Deepawali, demand for sweets increases.
Given this, the sale of poor and counterfeit goes up.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colourful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70 thousand rupees from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand rupees from uetta Colony.
With the increase in the demand of sweets in the market, the demand for poor May has also increased from Madhya Pradesh.
The department got information about bringing the poor move kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave's consignment is being sent to Nagpur from the transport garage.
The department took possession of this route, whose price was told to be 70 thousand rupees.
Fear of action has not expressed the right to anybody.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed (declared) property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caterers located in uetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphite was used to shine and stay for a long time.
Its sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, co-operator of the department said that the campaign of chemical sweets and poor and counterfeit moves will continue.
In the next few days, information about this campaign has been given by the department.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause poisonous constraints.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from curry.
People have been appealed by the department to be cautious of counterfeit sweets and leaves.
42 senior leaders of the state BJP received their strong reception at the airport.
It is notable that Modi has come on a tour of Bihar for a consolidation visit organized by the BJP.
The organization of Satwana Yatra is the exercise of rubbing the family members of the people killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is notable that during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi on October 27 in Patna, there were a total of seven blasts after one.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to make a stampede during the rally so that more and more people would be casualties and there was an atmosphere of panic in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyred by the BJP.
The party leaders have come out on a trip from Thursday by taking bone-class from their village.
On November 5, all their bones will be flown simultaneously in the Ganges in Patna.
Satwana Yatra is being organised as part of this journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of those killed in the blasts from seven o'clock in the morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, he will also provide a check of five to five rupees to the families of the dead.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Encouraged by the blasting victory in the last match, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final forest against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its goal will be to capture the series with victory.
India had to win Nagpur forest in any situation to remain in the series after the continuous washing of two forest matches due to rain and its batsmen won the record while performing the blast, so that the team matched 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved the goal of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and the biggest goal is also proving to be a lie in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, in the form of Rohit and the summit, the team has got a salute pair which is easing the work of the rest of the batsmen with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat an opportunity to play without any pressure while making a grand partnership in the opening.
The wonderful performance that Kohli has done so far on the third place is considered to be Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Rather, many cricket pundits have termed him better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 years old next week, has set 17 one centuries, out of which India has won 16.
Following the goal, their average is above 80.00 and has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Rana and Yuvraj were badly floping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, he can work as a good innings 'Lifeline' in Bangalore forest.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Belly, have influenced everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding to be taken in the test team for the domestic Asia series against England.
Australia has good batsmen till the ninth number.
Besides Believe, Shen Watson, Glen Maxwell, Adam Wags and James Fockner have batted good in the series.
However, Phil Hunge and Aeron Finch have not been able to leave any effect in the opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can be heavy to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed spectacularly in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Asia Series.
BJP National Executive member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this showing peace.
Referring to the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing the heel to infiltrate terrorists around 2000 prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let peace on the border.
After the failure of separatists to spoil the situation on a large scale by provoking people in Kashmir, Pakistan has become even more scattered.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of separatists last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lt Gen aheer-ul-Islam, LeT, Hizb's donor Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism will be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is busy fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for ending the privileges of the army in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people till there is permanent peace in the state.
These give honey to anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of leaders' army, security forces should be banned.
Snow Den ready to collaborate with Germany on American vigilance
Edward Snow Den, US intelligence informer, has declared that Germany is ready to travel to Berlin to prove Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fails to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Den in Russia, where he was given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented by Mr. Snow Den before the media in Berlin on Friday, "Although the result of my efforts is positive, my government believes in disagreement as a party-change, and does not provide any rescue, which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of gangstery. .
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Den said that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to deny criminal allegations against him.
The allegations filed by the US Justice Department include secretariat and theft from the government's property.
Hans Peter Fredric, German Internal Affairs Minister, told Online Weit: "Mr. Snow Den is ready to talk to German officials, so we have to find ways to make it possible.
The relationship between the US and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has claimed that the phone of Chancellor Angela Markel has been bugged.
Thomas Operman, MP, who is the president of the parliamentary committee, supervises intelligence.
Mr. Stro Belle, a Green Party MP, published a picture of his own with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.

The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities , When the problems of human condition have been resolved .
Rontier Airlines will charge carriage on bagge
Rontier Airlines plans to charge  100 to store goods for passengers on your plane board.
Rontier Airlines plans to start a charge for 100 for a carriage on bag and it will charge 2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday told that passengers can keep the whole compartment.
New carriage - On duty is for bag in overhead bin, so, the small bag below the seat will still be free.
Rontier said that  25 will charge if paid in advance, 100 will have to wait if travelers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Rontier spokesman Kate O'Mally said that  100 fees have to be obtained to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge him, he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger fees are filled with as much as they can, in the Carey-on-baggage that is stashed in the overhead box, that means there's often less space in this box.
There's a way to bring down the fee board to the passengers.
O'Mally said this isn't actually about mobilizing new charge money.
It's for the most loyal customers about the rontier to find out the place of overhead bin has become faster.
Passengers who buy tickets in their website of the airline do not have to give this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay  100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate can get a bag free of cost.
O'Mally said that the ronter's website and check-in processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Rontier's new carriage - on fees, will not start until summer although a date has not been fixed.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction with baggage fees and other fees, but airlines like them.
They argue that money is spent to handle the baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
The baggage fees on Wall Street are looking as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them don't even touch the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc.. started the Carey-on fee for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
Along with such a fee, other airlines are Hungary's II Air, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said, and who tracks ad-on-fee.
He said that Spirit's carriage-on fee brings 50 million dollars in a year, which was estimated in December 2011 report.
A former official of Sorensen, Midwest Airlines flew in Spirit recently and the passengers had to face a carry-on extraordinary bag fee at the gate but expressed surprise.
"The boring process I saw in my airline career was comfortable, he said.
I hoped to suck teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"It was full of air and he climbed it Licketty-split."
Rontier is also following the 2 fee of 'Spirit for coffee, tea, soda, or juice'.
Those travelers who take soda, or juice, can keep the whole coffee, and give it free coffee for only one time.
It'll still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinking substances in 2008, but after the complaint of passengers, they retreated seven months later and followed any other main airline after being there.
Rontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, this move of Rontier to charge fees on Carey-On is his latest attempt to operate customers towards his own website.
Airlines pays to the travel seller online for such tickets sold from 10 to 25.
This is the reason why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy directly from those people rather than going through an online travel agency.
Rontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many flights often started paying half a miles away for those customers who bought from these persons from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 miles rantier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It is also that they allow the only passengers to choose their seat in advance on buying directly from the rontier website.
There's a loyal base of clients in the city of your house in the Danner of Rontier, but its business is getting reduced and it's losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial consequences released by the corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Rontier's finance as part of the airline sales.
NSA accused "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical deficiency, our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people claimed online.
In the statement sent by the Intelligence Agency, the email said, "Today night NSA.Gov was not in access for several hours, which was due to internal error during the pre-determined update.
This problem will be resolved this evening.
This claim is not true that this obstacle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, the online server trackers had found that the website of NSA was closed for at least six hours, and the site for some users is still not in access.
NSA spokesman told ABC News that there was no "MoU" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacklist group has claimed online that they are responsible for interrupting the website of NSA by the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large quantity until the site is closed due to overloading the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unresolved and the objective of the attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of the system.
The former most mysterious NSA, which was never named as an agency, has become a topic of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people due to the presence of a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs in the last month - which was collectively dissolved by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to steal secret NSA files from the agency and after the revelation.
Due to the growing controversy over the agency, there was speculation that this incident was a result of the targeted cyber operation after the night incident.
Beautiful expressions were presented in accordance with the story of 'One and Dronacharya' showing coordination between the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's perspective, a guru is forced to walk on the wrong path in which daughters.
The drama was inaugurated jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Chairman of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The drama showed the equality of Dwapar era Dronacharya and presently a professor Arvind's circumstances.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Uncle, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. gave a grand presentation while doing complete justice with the characters.
The light system in the play was designed by young colorful worker Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
Subsequently, in the function, various awards were given to the subjects contributing to literary, cultural contributions from Apta.
In this, Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of the Urdu Department of Charan Singh University, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and colorful worker Jitendra C. Raj were given.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed in the executive office bearers in making the event successful.
Bombardier's profits in the form of delivery of aircraft, decline in orders
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a decline of 15 percent in net profits on Thursday, in the third quarter of its train unit and less aircraft orders and pressure by delivery on contract issues.
Montrial-based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues related to the release of any flight test data for his brand new Series aircraft or his ambitious program to go to commercial service from September next.
About one more half months before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been blown only three times, the question has been raised whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the share has sent more than 8 to the Toronto Stock Exchange for sliding.
Cameron Dorsen, a analyst share with the National Bank Financial, had reduced its rating to the field demonstration on Thursday, the stock is limited over the next one or two quarters.
"Worthy aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with marginal performance in transport, "Dorsen said in a client note."
We'll get a new order for the Bombardier Series as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, it is suspected that the market program will be embarrassed.

New research has revealed that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think like stealing or cheating.
But as soon as the evening, our mind changes and we start walking against the rules keeping the ideal on one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of Harvard University and David Eclus School of Business of UTO.
According to the researchers, in the morning, we prefer moral values while not being stressed, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
Researchers used two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
It was seen in this experiment that those who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
At the same time, during the use of people between 12 and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately responded wrongly by keeping their roots in mind.
The researchers managed to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but as soon as the evening we stop paying attention to ethics.
This research has been published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Mr . Big was imprisoned by a lawyer of Koken who gave secret information about police investigations
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Nil Scarboro
The advocate felt that people might know about the addiction of his confidential drugs .
He was sentenced to three years in jail by Liverpool Crown Court
To the top defendant, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was scared, people would know about his illicit addiction of drugs, three years of imprisonment.
42-year-old Barashat Ditta, after compromising on the addiction of his cocaine, provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities to the infamous criminal Nil Scarboro.
This advocate, who was given the name of "Bash" and was praised as "top brief" by the criminals, was arrested from his house in 2011 after the police monitoring operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the last Narcotics trial.
Officials had seen 32-year-old Scarboro keeping three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for Law Society Dinner with his colleagues.
After getting the cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, her bubbles and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of drugs of A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his associate.
As part of the main investigation of Heroin and Cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercedes, Berkshire and West Yorkshire, all the four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after the police seized cash worth 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds during several raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta provided information to the criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about the habit of his cocaine.
Ditta, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in BlackBund, was facing inadequacy in Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the path of justice after three weeks of trial.
He accepted about keeping cocaine in the previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started when the police came to know that he was in contact with DITA regularly on the phone from February 2011 while examining Scarboro.
Two spies followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping more than 60 percent pure drug under the lawyer's bin in Black Golf Glove.
After being kept intoxicating drugs, Scarboro was regularly in contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at Black Rovers Football Stadium, Ewud Park.
On reaching the house, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a nine-time dialogue between them.
It was heard in the court that when the clues of A category drugs were found on DITA's hair, boots and credit cards, he was found to be a "regular user" of Cocaine in the test.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use the cocaine and said that he was talking to the suspect dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was a subject of "strategic privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove his batua and remove many credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run offices from his workplace as well as his house, and his clients used to call at his house for legal matters.
After telling the main persons arrested, what the spy knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the major people of the drug supply chain, some of which he had presented the case before.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said, "The criminal advocate should be the best known about not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, connecting very much with his special client.
We are not talking about the ordinary drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his border of lawyer-client relations.
He was as much possible, interrupted the investigation of the police so that he could continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession but insulting.
He made a very close proximity to some certain clients, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement with his independence.
Ditta denied any wrong work and claimed that "If I was a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and if I want to inform Mr. Scarboro, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I do this work immediately."
But after the hearing, the Superintendent of the Lancashire Police Lee Helstead said that at the time Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal.
Due to the habit of his cocaine, he made an excessive agreement and became very weak towards the objectives of leading members of the organised crime groups who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and trust and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to avoid his profession under the guise.
The serious and organised Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, in which he was found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now interrupting the path of justice, which reflects our commitment to bringing the culprits to court.
This matter should be warned for the criminals that no person is away from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarboro was found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and fencing, after 14 years of imprisonment.
Twenty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about him, in which he said that his fancy job will be a lawyer for the death penalty client in the US, his dinner of Mohammed Ali and inequality should be inspired for his work.

US Circuit Court Appellate 2 And Judge Shira Shindelar has said that the judge's decision results will be pending as a result of an appeal by the city.

Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Collson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused that while being the Home Secretary of Charles Clark, he used phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his fatal relations.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis .C. told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a wrong rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting with his "fascinating special adviser" Hannah Polbi.
It was said in the court that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Milkyer to hack Polby's voicemail and keep that male "Nazar", but Collson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Adis said that "Mr. Collson, who is now the editor of NOTW, does not know how to keep an eye on the people's house, but he keeps an article before the people, see what people respond to him. "
He said that NOTW used three ways to check cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third person himself included editors.
It is obvious that he knew about the other way i.e. salvation, he definitely knew.
What about the first one
Did he know about phone hacking
He says, no, we say that "Yes, he knew absolutely.
Regarding Clark's affairs, rumors were presented for the first time by AOTW's feature desk, when a source, sexually interested in Ms. Polbi, had said, "Do not waste your time, it is with Charles.
In August 2006, the tape of Wysmail was seized at least three times from Ms. Polbi's phone from home to Milkyer.
The investigators also found such entries in the computer of the private investigator, on which Ms. Polbi and his sister were named "Project".
During the period in which he was being investigated, information was sought about Ms. Polbi's grandfather by calling anonymous.
During this period, former Chief Reporter Nevili Thurlbek and former reporter James Weatherup looked at Ms. Polbi's visit.
On June 18, 2005, through a voicemail, Colson told him: "I have got a story, which we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I must talk to Charles.
Mr. Addis said that the inclusion of the callson in this case is in the pattern of other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The Justice Peeth heard on Thursday that Colson interacted with Mr. Blanket about marriage relations with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the case of co-operator Rebekha Brooks, who was married at that time.
Callson and Brooks refused to reconnect with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Milkyer, Turlback and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.

The German media asked B to express hope to identify the presence of Lisoning Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in America and Berlin.
James Claiper , Director of American National Intelligence , stressed that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to steal trade secrets of foreign companies and to enhance their international competitiveness or enhance the line below them .
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has created Whistleblower, the treasury of his secrets started telling American monitoring, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director follows his promise or not.
The American National Security Agency spyed on Brazil ' s oil company , Petrobras , and our cloud providers , Google and Yahoo , and Yahoo feared the state supervision .
The last thing came when it came to know that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely the leaders of the business world are also making possible goals.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think this data will be viable to be used for mutual benefit .
"Germany should be awakened, Oliver Grn, President of BITMI, who represents small and medium-size German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the Consultancy of German companies in July, the US has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and stealing data.
There's no evidence that the US has known the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union and must try to reduce their dependence on the US.
Leaders of the business world are doubting about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Platner, President of German business software company SAP, "This is no way," said.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he would not have to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is concessional, from coal to car, farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations highlighted by Snowden on American technical deliberations and espionage access have proved to be an injury to some companies who had previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China .
There is a major change in the Cloud Computing Centre where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the United States is under the jurisdiction and , therefore , has become potentially sensitive .
According to a survey conducted by a business organization, Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent non-US members canceled the plan to use a US based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-chairman of SAP says: "We saw a new question that did not come to the customers a year ago - Where is my data stored" And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that jurisdiction
Many German officials argue that the latest report was just confirming whether they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most precious secrets and data and that is why they should be guarded at every cost.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
It has always happened.
"This is a topic for many years , and through the original present discussion, nothing changed is said to be the Chief Executive of Cart Bock, Chemical Manufacturer BAS.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it ' s in national interest to protect our business .
Corporate leaders are usually not interested in defense system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, the message has been recording for a long time, whether it is impossible to leave one in the business from home, or to leave a laptop unnecessarily in a hotel room, at least to say.
Members of the board of Larich Hackenberg, Car Manufacturer Audi, say that this is a year old system to collect mobile phones before the board meetings because they can not be used as remote hearing devices.
Germany's FB executive, when smart phones are compromising on foreign tours due to risk, advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown later.
However, it is a matter of concern that small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the top in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium size companies often warn in a report to protect corporate secret effectively against lack of experience, personnel and financial resources unauthorized access.
America has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of American national intelligence in February was named in another tire of criminals involved in hacking for the economic information behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a German Blue Chip Company board member, when the matter comes to espionage, French is the worst.
In the interview, former head of the Bernard Swarcini French Internal Intelligence Agency URI, points out: "Servicemen know well that even though all the countries cooperate in the non-terrorist battle, they spy on their colleagues.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do , because it ' s in national interest to protect our business .
No fool made.
"The parents of Georgia's teenager killed in an accident believe that their son was murdered."
A teenager from Georgia, whose dead body was found wrapped in his high school gym, believes that his son was murdered, the family's advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. Central Johnson was found trapped on January 11 in a straightforward match behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.
The investigators of Landes County Sheriff had concluded that Johnson was killed in a "novel accident", but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Corp, who presented Kenneth and Jacquelin Johnson, told Fox News.com that "He believes that his son has been murdered."
They do not believe in death in the manner told by Sheriff.
क्रम said that "he believes that this thing is beyond the argument of physical rule and normal intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag."
US Advocate General Michael Muller said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, considering that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the reason for death
Did he be killed due to any crime
Mure said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring the truth out.
He said that "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation."
Moore told the reporter that the initial body test indicates that Johnson's death was a result of stable respiratory infection.
According to Moore, there was a different reason for death in a second body test.
He said that "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Moore also said that if he gets enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, then he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not available immediately to comment from the office of Landez County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to issue all monitoring videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say that they hope that video footage will indicate how he died.
CDC issues allergy guidelines for children for schools
On Wednesday, the Disease Control and Prevention Center issued guidelines for controlling food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued by the US Government for the first time, as the number of children going to school is increasing due to food allergy.
Now one of the 20 children in the US has food allergy.
CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, cases of food allergy in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this guidelines, it has been informed for schools how to inform teachers and employees about food allergy of children, and how to handle them in case of any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of epinephrine to face fatal intensity (Anaphilaxis) which is the auto-injector of Appen Brand, which is commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, so that the schools can easily keep the stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It seems that something is shouting in my tongue, "I feel that there is a hair on my tongue, or "My tongue is shouting."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose sex of their children uncertain
Germany has become the first country of the European Union, which has given recognition to the third gender for children born with unseen genitals.
Now the newborn children will not be specified in a conventional manner.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "determined or "determined" on the child's birth certificate.
The objective of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can take sex specification surgery decisions for newborns and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said after years, "I am a male, not a woman."
I will continue to be wounded, stained, made by doctors.
According to the estimates, one of the 2,000 children every year is such that neither the boy nor the girl is.
They are intersex, part of a group of approximately 60 conditions, which comes under investigation of gender development disorders, is a collective word which is used for abnormal chromosome, genital gland or abnormally developed gender.
It may be that Walice Sympson has been intersex.
The sex identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex can not be done, it is better to use the best information to specify sex and inspect the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery, if such a job comes.
Dr. Jack Dresher, psychologist of New York City, who is an expert in gender-recognition, said that the new law of Germany seems to be "good".
Intersex children create moral confusion.
He said, "Some people are in a state of livelihood, for which surgery is required, but it does not happen with most children.
You can specify sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will be developed in a child is not very accurate.
No person can respond properly about why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle that why people are homosexual.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described as transsexual or transgender people, because their position is not related to sex, but its biological creation, which is not clearly a man or woman, but either a joint form of both or not clearly defined.
These features can demonstrate themselves in secondary gender symptoms such as weight of muscles, distribution of hair, breast and length primary gender symptoms such as reproductive organs and genitals or chromosome structures and hormones.
The report provides a surveillance of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-favourable gender boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark men, women or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nari Me-Welbi became the world's first recognition-recognised sex-free person after winning the legal appeal to keep sex status specified for life.
According to the internal ministry, the German passport will also have the third specification as  for intersex persons besides M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw gender principles from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, "When the world is going in a state where sex is an option to be elected itself, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.
The mother of the newborn in Meriland also told the baby one that she would like to see the children being specified at the time of birth.
He said on the website about surveillance, "In addition to the boundaries, surveillance is very stressful, especially if you do not even know what is the sex of your child.
Children need stability and decisiveness.
Historically, both men and women, who were born with genitals, were called harmaphroditis (Ubhailingi), which was in the name of beautiful Greek deity, which was double.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered the gender as a slate, which could have been eradicated and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that sex is a complex work, and sometimes there may be a mistake from doctors, who do not know what children will feel about their sex specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Manorrhoea Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgery.
The existing theory regarding the treatment of unexpected genitals was presented by Dr. John Money, University of John Hapkins, who regarded sex as golden.
He composed the word Linga Identity and argued how social and environmental signs - how parents enhance the child - interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify it as a male or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, which is known as John John, his principles became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex had accidentally gone to sex during sex sex surgeon (surgemony) to bind the child completely and expel her ovary and make her gender like a girl.
The dresser said, "Mani presented that matter as a successful case of transfer, but it did not happen.
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
The dresser said that some doctors are still following "his pattern".
But in the years after the year 1990, with the arrival of the Internet, the people passing through these sex surgery started coming out "the result is not happy."
The same case was with Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Doctors did not understand clearly that his sex was small, or his fugitive was big, but he was certain that he could never live a satisfactory life as a man.
Therefore, after some time of his birth in 1976, the external organs and ovaries of Brussels were removed by surgery and her upbringing was done as a girl.
He was given women hormones at the age of 12.
He told ABNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he was supposed to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and some disturbances, he demanded medical records.
This led to the terrible truth.
I was bound at the time of birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented her body from making adequate testosterone, due to which her genitals could not be developed properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
Due to surgery, he became barren.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called Interface Project to make their perception normal.
However, the legal group of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, Executive Director Ani Tamar-Mattis, expresses concern that Germany's law invites "Chippy" and stigma.
She says, "The active people feel that Germany's law will inspire parents to take quick decisions and specify the child."
We are afraid that it will encourage interference.
Instead of waiting, we think it is a better process to specify male or female gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supports the Australian law because "It allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
He said, "Adults should be able to take their own decisions about the legal gender."
Germany's law relates to specify it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Pittsburg's breast radiologist Dr. Erlein Baratz, whose daughter has sexual development disorders, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the law of Germany will give strength to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she was a DSD named full Androgen insensitivity attachment.
Since there was a fault in his Androgen collection, women's symptoms were developed in CAT.
He has vagina in his body but there is no uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and is a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Though he is barren, but he hopes to become a mother through adoption or hostel surrogacy.
Baratz said, "This law facilitates parents not to make any decision in haste."
It gives them proper understanding and time by some tests before writing a man or a woman.
In this way, you are okay - upgrade the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy him.
We do not need to do such surgery in a hurry that can not be returned.
He said, "It brings children in the process of taking decisions and frees parents from the inspiration because they do not believe that they are recovering."
Finally, the child will determine which sex she is more comfortable - and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Legal awareness camp was organized by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar under the chairmanship of Committee and all the judge of Ramnagar Sandeep Kaur in the middle school Dalher of Ramnagar.
In which students and others were given information about the rights of education and law for economically backward people.
Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch in the camp made people aware while speaking on the above topic.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times , the close advisers of President Barack Obama quietly considered Hillary Clinton instead of Biden for the post of Vice President for the ticket 2012 .
The most remarkable blast in the revelation is that Mark Halperine and John Helemon have a hugely anticipated 2012 campaign tom, "Duble Down: Sports Change 2012".
Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told Thursday evening that what dumping bidden can help Obama's re-election to know about the top advisors of the President 's 'Commercial Group-States' and late 2011.
According to Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book tells the full information in the campaign of the Chief Officers and put the main bills of the former White House staff for the name, to know what effects the change from the Vice President of the former state to the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and within the overall office .
With only half a dozen President's close advisories, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerod and David Palaufa were under consideration.
Double Down claims that Delle tried to change Biden , despite his personal synergy , when he was finally telling his information , that Clinton ' s ticket would not improve Obama ' s situation .
In an interview with Martin, Daley has confirmed that the administration actually considered the place of Clinton with Biden.
"I kept the whole scene in view, and one of them, this was the one who told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidential post was in danger at that time, we were in such a hospitality, "The Holy Christ, what will we do more"
While Delle told the research in the form of caution, Martin had told Enderson Cooper of UNN that the election campaign again invested significantly in finding out how much benefits will be given to the poll.
 Campaign does not spend on polling and focus-oriented groups like money until they are seriously considering something, Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, did Obama know that his team is looking for changes.
Martin told the CNN that he asked him to put his boss about the possible reshuffle
While Daley said that he didn ' t think the President knew about possible changes , the former Chief of Staff believed that it was possible that Obama knew it .
"Duble down: Will not answer whether political investigations have reached Obama's desk" Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know about Biden dumping ticket research.
"Perhaps, Martin said.
Glo-in-The- Do you like Dark Ice Cream
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first Glo-in-De-Dark Ice Cream - using jailfish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of maritime animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came after reading a research paper on prisonfish and the trusted scientists of China used the chemical brightness to revive the protein.
The ice cream, the eater will react to the tongue and increase the Ph level of protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says the ice cream is bright with reacting to the heat of the mouth, i.e. it will be so bright as to win.
Lick Me, founder of IM Dalissius Icecream Company, Charlie said: "This is an unbelievable thing but the production of early days will get me 200 to approximately 100 grams of goods.
The protein we are using in ice cream will respond to neutral Ph in tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the protein will increase the PH level and the ice cream will shine.
We ' ve been examining for the past few months and it looks absolutely right to share on helovine because it gives a wonderful shining effect
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream that I have made because the glitter of jailfish is four times more expensive than gold .
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds .
However, the taste of Visa is very good.
Appne is famous for extraordinary taste, including experimental company, beer, paneer, meat and gold leaves based in Charlie's bristle.
But his next creation is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.
It is naturally impossible because of the ice crystal that makes changes over the ice cream, but I think we will get a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of a reflected property of a prisonifying which has been synchronized by Chinese scientists
In the Rani Bagh Market, the whole market was stuck to the customers.
The situation was that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy the utensils.
This is the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and the Central Market located in Prashant Vihar.
Some similar views were also seen at Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Sarafa shops of Model Town.
Here also people bought gold and silver ornaments and coins fiercely.
For this reason, there is also a jam in other markets including the external ring road.
However, people from the office had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Helovine 2013: By numbers
When I was young, helovin was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat Candy, stay silent and play dress up for neighborhood.
Nowadays, I'm more than a greed
I did not even sign in to give out the candy from my apartment for the last two years and perhaps it will not be this year.
But statistics show that I ' m a black sheep when Holovoven comes
According to the National Retail Federation, most of the Americans are actually celebrating 158 million this time, spending 6.9 billion candy and costume and decoration.
One thing I've always seen is every. Helovin's tendencies.
According to NCR, the total cost of dress out of 6.9 billion is estimated to be 1.2 billion.
This year, all sex is angry with innocent things.
Women don ' t have to make sex because they have sex food like pisza , hamburgers and carrots .
I hope a lot of ambis, and thanks to the dead, I'll make our Instagram feeds for the men of space this year.
According to Google, the most found dresses will be ambis, buttons, robbers and stolen.
I guess there is no evil in being traditional.
Last year we wore dogs and we were not alone with surprise.
According to the NCR, Americans will actually spend 330 million for pet dresses.
That's irony that many hotdogs are with dogs.
When Candy's talk comes, we do not see around.
According to the Nilsen company, Americans will spend  1.9 billion this year.
Heyershi Bars, Lollipops, Milk Duds, Twislers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the American Commerce Department, it is a good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are going to participate in our neighborhood.
But in fact we'll buy, and those who're joking during the 90 million chocolate heloven.
According to the Confectioners Association, we will not use one thing during the heloven, Candycon, but they will also sell about 35 million pounds.
He is about Mecca's personal knot 9 billion.
It's a mystery.
Nothing is more than the elementary helovine bottles homes.
They're the best name, "Terror behind the wall (who is actually a prison), "Chich-O-Chich" and "House of Shawk."
According to American power, there's 1200 officially sanctioned houses in the United States that generates 500 million revenues, and those terrible pictures that put your friend on the facebook and the man who looks at you and commemorates the Nace Face.
Finally, talk about Kaddu.
Charlie Brown presented the great trait when we were children, and a Jack-o-Lalten carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is what we have done since we were small.
For us, fortunately, "Baby in-A pumpkin trend" started last year, due to the pinterest, so most of us grew up of these guards and did not stay with them.
According to the US Census Bureau, this year, America will spend Kaddu around  106 million.
Perhaps from Elinois on the front portion of Lantern , which gradually marched from 542 million pounds this year .
If you're looking for additional loans, try to exclude their 2,032 pounds in Phone Time and Susan Mosque Napa, Kalif, and above.

Cocker Spanish Ruby fled after a small road collision .
He was seen by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later .
Fire brigade personnel dropped the front rock below the rope to save the dog from the mouth of death
After being trapped on the face of a crispy mountain at 50 feet above the ground by Papi, he got a fortunate life by calling firefighters.
The nine-month-old cocker, Spanish Ruby, fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Elderson, 25, and his girlfriends were in the flappy mine in Yorkshire to meet Bakey Hall, 20, Denhome, Ruby, and he thanked the Western Yorkshire Fire and Defence Service.

George Keravan : Euro Dissolution options to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of membership of the EU, independent Scotland will be required to join the entire Europe as an independent travel territory.
Passport control on the Barvik and indicate stories about the boundary of the thorny wire on the walls of the handrian.
It is true that the Streetclide Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, though it was not described in the predicted Headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that the EU members spend most of their time in changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shagen area, Brussels will really be cheaper for non-compliance Brussels instead of obtaining whatever they want from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time, first of all, I had heard the uncontrollable news of passport control about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point lost in reciting this interesting old story.
Anyway, why should you expect Europe's bidding from independent Scotland
Why should Yok of London be sold for Brussels, especially now
There is real European news here: The great plan to organise Europe, after war, has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
In the entire EU, the dedicated parties are getting strength to oppose the EU or close the euro as equal currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscopetil Alternative for Germany Party - which has been established this year - suddenly came and won about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections of September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our Lib Dams).
The plan to build federal Europe has always been a domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be radical changer.
With the strict rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone far away due to the obstacles imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
In the high budget deficit of the national governments, the crisis of Euro did not have a very much role - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system stabilized its members in favor of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency disintegration, South Europe finds itself in a condition of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce salary and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
Greater European productivity is sicker than the current budget and currency problems.
In order to exempt the French and German energy firms on consumer expenditure - as a result of the Green Energy Policys imposed by Brussels, European Industry doubles electricity and pays four times for gas compared to the United Nations.
This pumping cost is a loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
To free all the salary in the world, European Petrochemicals Industry can not be saved from being affected by cheap US shell gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt in the people, especially in France, which was once the main fan of the EU.
After the war, French top politicians had seen the EU as a means to control Germany and provide Paris equal billing to Washington in the world.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the French economy is staging.
Consequences: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front, has won the ruling socialist in the recent by-election, pushing it to third place.
At this time, the Front is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote in France - it is a timely warning to the British Labor that they can not assume that the dissolution for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
Lee Pen is doing with the fame of his newly found among the French guys, working class
This party wants to use the EU elections to be held next year to form an anti-EU, supreme anti-monetary group in the European Parliament.
If, as far as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, such a group can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My vision is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-curriculum sentiment in Europe will end Euro.
Euro will not be completely over, but it will return to the Footkar (Universe) countries in any form like Europe, which will be supported by General De Gaul.
Germany and some of its unique economies can maintain Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I hope that the UK will keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing close proximity to the US.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better work in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-Service nations to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - has been the most successful anti-discriminatory political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the proposed cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Elistey Darling and after that on the basis of the Tori-Lib Dam alliance.
Voting for independence for Scotland at this time will be a matter of ruthlessness, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of misuse imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Youth before time: To grow quickly
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get youth at a younger age compared to the girls of their age.
Physical change doesn ' t mean that the youth is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed .
Experts believe that obesity outbreak can be a reason for youth at a young age
The case of youth prematurely is not so effective in boys .
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etharis is a specialist journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts developing breasts and genitals at the age of 7 or 8
In the annual conference of the American Child Medical Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, Dr Paul Caplovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, which show new trends.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time in providing assurances to parents - that it usually does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
Direct symptoms of development such as breasts getting numb, genitals and womb hair and physical smell are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of registration (first menstruation).
In United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When breasts start developing , it takes at least two to three years in the first resource , Caplovitz explains , which are the writers of "Mothers from time to time young : The guides needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of the youth, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two are called "ball-aged".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - whose child doctors can inspect near.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to investigate so that the possibilities of serious problems like tumors or cyst can be overcome.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: timely age growth of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and drama as adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment, child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adult.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Capolytes are aware of medicines but accept, "Suppressing youth can increase practical issues, and girls can feel different from their colleagues."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents do not want her younger age daughter to be menstrual.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain cleanliness."
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, "This was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, but it was not emotionally prepared.
He was scared of his school and returned to trouble that in his friends, he first started menstruation.
There are many prevalent principles about the causes of untimely youth.
Nevertheless, there is no continuous evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual oriented messages in the media can be accused.
Boys are also getting youth from time to time like girls.
Caplovitz determines the rule that its main reason is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting a study on girls from 6 to 9 years of age in 2001, which connects the fat of the body with the time of youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get younger girls before their age.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the image of premature youth, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by all things.
Other puzzle: although the boys are getting the hair of faces and genitals at a young age, but the whole trend of youth is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors present at the AAP Conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, the hair of pimples and genitals has become common.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child doctor at Gorgeb Children's Hospital in Moristoun, Newsercy, says, "We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginning of the youth."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child doctor to take opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean talking before the expected time."
If you remain calm, your child will usually answer properly.
Girls developing prematurely need to be assured that even though it is happening prematurely, it is a part of normal life.

Big orders of jet manufacturers are at stake with controversy for seat width .
This month's Dubai Arsho has started a competition to set up a fight for the dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long distance flights.
The dispute is focused on the width of the Economy Class seat in long flight aircraft, not always given by the airlines, but its allotted space capability has been claimed by the late Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus has hoped to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches -LRB- cms -RRB- in the economy cabin this week but it should be decided by airlines its main opponent Boeing says .
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when there was a competition to sell the twin engine of the long distance aircraft from the order recorded possible after the incident of 17-21 .
How has the previous department of the aircraft been created - especially whether the designs of Mini Jambo Jets are being prepared keeping in view the claims of seating 9 or 10 is equal
Boeing says it is 777  , which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in one line in the academic department .
Airbus says that while competing with A350, it will take 350 people away from 18 inches to 9 equally placed seat.
Air giants often strike trade on technical matters through advertisements in business press .
Now, with Airbus 777 , Dubai is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Arsho, so is appealing to the public further.
Recently, it is being seen that what has been the beginning of the Vigyapan War, will you accept it simultaneously in three restaurants showing this to Finsero
Airbus Sales Chief John Lehi has also said "Boing regional turbos are also offering long distance flights in narrow seats."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way to sit in the plane has not changed.
According to the US Health Department data, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 jambo ne defined Ki Yatra for a long time, and the average weight of 40-49-year-old American males increased by 10 percent.
According to the US Health Statistics, the average American man in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus points out that a rival in 1950 is stuck with concept when the new name was narrow , the average periphery of Jet set .
Airbus says that he has set up a research commission which suggests improvement in the quality of sleep of an additional inch 53 per cent in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the airbus seat measurement data , and said that it is not dependent on the decision of the manufacturers how the airlines maintain balance between fares and facilities .
It is also said, research shows that more than one seat's width depends on the experience of cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said that it actually tells what they need to do to give flexibility to airlines and those things which believe that they need to succeed .
 They do not want to tell us who they have benefits.
They know better of their business than anyone else.
It is about the elbow room for the flyers, but it is an issue fast for the suppliers that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute, it is estimated that at least  700 billion trade is sufficient in the coming decades to tip the US and European exports of the aircraft order.
The reporter told that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually an issue of fighting between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 per seat per seat has been efficient, in their new twin engine design, the leader of that section, 365-seat Boeing 777-300.
The claim of showing Boeing depends on the 10 , 777 x , comparatively 777 designed with the original 9 .
The comparison has now been utilized with the benefit of the unit cost.
Kevin Kenston, head of Europe's Airbus Passenger Facility says, "This Boeing aircraft is doing to capture more seats to make our products, along with more competitive."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat per line cabin is suggested for the current 777 SC that many passengers are in favor of the denser layout, which can go along with cheap rent.
Cabin Interior Expert My Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said that the eighteen-inch seat will be very good for the passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is operated by the threat of proposal 777.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to select suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors from all over the world also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
Relaxing more, all builders are also providing high density layouts for low-cost aircraft services and regional travel.
He is giving an airbus 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold right now.
But recently, Airbus stressed on widespread cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft to need more cabin facility.
Modern jet planes are not likely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it can distract from the wave of 777  sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can end the fun from smoking.
The same dose of vaccine was capable of protecting rats from the habit of nicotine for the whole life.
Before starting the test on humans, there is a need for further testing, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Christal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the initial signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said that "We hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers, who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction of nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. "
The new vaccine has a harmless virus which has been prepared to provide genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectly infects the liver cell, which then starts making a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies discover any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevents them from summoning nicotine inside the smoker by making them ineffective before reaching the brain.
In the test, the rats given vaccines, which were later given nicotine, continued to do their normal activities.
The researcher says that but the rat which was not given vaccine was "good", it was an indication that Nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a magazine called Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give doses at regular intervals so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of new vaccine is expected to be very much, because the liver cell will make antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, then it can be given to children before the greed of testing cigarettes, so that they can be saved from the addiction of nicotine.
But perhaps it will be used by smoking persons to quit smoking.
He said that "He will know that if he starts smoking again, then he will not get any pleasure from smoking due to nicotine vaccine, which can help in redeeming his habit."
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not arise due to the actual reason for the death of Baghin.
In response to this, the Forest Department is telling the death of the tiger at the first sight of natural.

Tripodi refuses to affect us by Obide.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by State Currency Watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to denounce the policy of maritime lease on the request of his political guru Adi Obide, the patron of the former New South Wales, Adi Obide, who had hidden interest in the government-controlled three lands.
The Independent Commission (IA) on Friday detailed the investigation against corruption whether Mr. Obide has violated the circulars of the lease policy of lobbying with several State Ministers, where two restaurants and caf owned by Obide, without a tender, were reviewed in August 2005 after the end of his time.
Lin Aspole, after the evidence given by the former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, he knew the hidden selfishness of Shri Tripodi Shri Obide of this charge, is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressurized to start public tenders for the lease.
The leasemen were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the entrances of the circular for the lease, from which Obide earned  2.5 million annually, were renewed from the tender without lease.
Shri Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargah from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr . Obide ' s request , Mr . Tripodi urged changes in the government lease policy .
A senior official, Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Don, who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports in a Phone Collection in IAF in August and September 2007.
Asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Healthy Mr. Tripodi. "Is the commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the development case"
"No, Mr. Tripodi responded."
I could not remember what discussed, but it was not sure.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obide.
Employees say Israeli fighters attacked Syria .
Israeli fighter aircraft targeted Latakia, the port city of Syria on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.

Israel has done air attacks on missiles within Syria at least two times in this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass through " authenticity test "
The government is considering a "certification test" for foreign employees on 457 visas, because its aim is to expand a harsh action.
If adopted, this test will be enforced through a criteria to prevent 457 to be used to fill unskilled posts in Australia or to reach out to family and friends in a wide range.
A Government Discussion letter was issued today, condemning the Governments dictatorship on foreign employees, former Labor M. P. Maxine Macque today said that it can provoke neighboring Australian countries.
He told the US India Institute today that "Foreign people are reaching the end of the queue and "Strong rhetoric about the job before the Australian people is very unpleasant at a time, while unions have demanded a safe labor market. "
Historically, it meant that white workers should have been provided security - and if some people in the area saw the voice of that historic evidence, I would not be surprised.
In the discussion letter, 12 measures have been demonstrated, which were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Boven.
Immigration Minister Brendan Oconer, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes while the remaining are under consideration.
If the "Authenticity Criteria" is adopted, then the visa applicant can be examined whether the nomination is true in such circumstances, in which the nominated person, the owner of the person sponsored the visa or the person belonging to the person or personal partner.
Businessmen may need to calculate the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessman who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees took hundreds of people to work.
During this week, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, Christmas Iceland, died of a suspected heart attack after coming to a refugee boat.
The nine-year-old son of that person had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after the death of his father, an adult cousin has tied the rope, which was on the same ship.
Australian officials sent the person to Christmas Iceland Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the US2 Railway Project.
Work by HS2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Cremer said that this project will make Britain one.
Scotland Transport Minister Kith Brown said that he is very excited by working with the UK government on this project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
On completion of the second phase, lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June, the government revised the cost of construction of high speed links between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion.
The British government, who was talking to the Scotland Transport, directed the US2 Ltd to consider the possibility of improving railway capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glassgo and Edinburg to London for three hours or less.
According to Barones Cremor: Our goal for the US2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.
We are moving ahead with the US2, because its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities of Britain, including Glassgo and Edinburg, which will be added better due to the US2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elistair Carmiel: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmiel to make a clear return to Scotland in the FS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high speed rail is likely to have huge economic benefits to Scotland, but this will also increase economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high speed rail across Britain.
Therefore, we are enthusiastic to work in the participation of the British Government so that we can examine options to bring high speed rail in Scotland, create benefits for all and fulfil the Glassgo-Adinberg line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am willing to review the investigation report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.
Aircraft Electricity Device Rules will remain effective in Australia
Despite the steps being taken softly in equipment regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will have to continue to shut down their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The US federal aviation administration has left the option to change its processes to the US aviation services companies so that during the important phases of the flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices, provided they remain in the aircraft mode.
Passengers can do so during many flights, but many people do not like to be unable to reach their e-books while flying and landing.
Australian Air Force Services Companies are considering this decision, according to which US Air Force Services Companies will have to work very much to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that he is considering the announcement, but insisted that restrictions on the use of electric equipment are still effective in important phases of flight in Australia.
At present, the LASA has no specific regulation to control the use of power equipment in the aircraft, the authority said, "This issue comes under regulations, according to which the Air Services Operations Companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to follow the security instructions given by the crew members.
Virgin, who is already talking to LASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but he asked the regulator to take further action on the instructions.
The spokesman said that "We will welcome the review by LASA in the matter of allowing the use of electric equipment, because we really feel that it will give better experience to the customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes. "
wantas said that it will now follow the current rules.
He said that "Our current policy can not be used to fly and electric equipment while landing, and we have no immediate plan to change it."
LAA decisions apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit the passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions of the LAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US aircraft service company and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft Services Companies need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disposal from mobile devices as well as to amend their rules books, training materials, care on brief details and travelers.
The LAA said that after the verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow the passengers to use light weight electric equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will direct the passengers to shut down their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper coaches while flying and landing.
The silver of the ponbrokers due to the trouble felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash by paying his gold bangles, rings and swings to pay his daughter's school fees in the ponshop at the Bendemier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
Smt. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought the house, so all our money is stuck in it.
She says that although she earns  3,000 (US2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also employs, but the family's monthly income is inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia where domestic debt is increasing - Valuemax, where they are doing their transactions, became the third ponshop listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
It is not the only way to get cash to grab ornaments - 1,300 Singapore dollars in case of Ms. Amirthalinga, but almost as cheap as the unsafe bank loan.
Normally, Ponbroker takes 17 per cent interest per year in Singapore, which is slightly higher than 15. 4 per cent presented by the United Overseas Bank, which is a local borrower who has a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of examining credit or not needing a certificate of salary, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are turning towards ponshops due to the increasing expenditure of livelihood by the families and the difficulties faced by the increase in domestic and consumer loans.
After a strong growth of five years after the global financial disaster, and due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, the low and middle income families are turning towards a ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agencies, Standards Ange Pures, primarily due to increasing hostage (Mortgage), described the growing domestic benefit as a risk factor for Asian banks' credit.
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic loan in proportion to GDP.
Malaysia is at the highest place in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are worried about the high levels of consumer loan in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the technology recession this week.
On Thursday, the data has shown a decrease in continuous export recession and consumer demand.
In the Malaysian Bank, CIMB, economist Song Seng Wun said, "The decisive point is that with the rising prices, people coming from the middle to the lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way.
In the last two years, historically higher values in gold prices have inspired people to keep individual assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the values of their family ornaments.
70 percent of the subsidized items in the city-state's 200 pon outlet in Singapore are gold.
People are saying, "The sense of gold is good, let's keep the grandmother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Ezamani, the largest ponshop operator of Thailand, has seen 20 percent increase in the number of customers using his outlet in recent months.
There is so much increase in the business of preserving that 15 others like this in Outlet's Outlet in Bendemier and 15 others in Singapore are not only planning to expand in their neighborhood, Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also planning to extend outside Asia, Executive Director of Valuemax Yah Lee Ching says.
The company will financing it with 60 percent of Singapore's  66 million in listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that not only gets affordable rates compared to other lenders, but also does not directly increase the loan.
She says, the consumer pledges things that they already have, and redemption of personal assets does not increase domestic debt.
To get short-term and safe financial assistance, the social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing.
It is not that only financially weak people use ponbrokers.
In Singapore, wealthy persons also use Valumex Outlet, they pledge gold bars or rollers, which can get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers of all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, "There are wealthy persons who need loans for a short time for business enterprise or investment, or small business who need to meet their cash flow requirements.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
India's largest businessman Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her berth-day not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
Many Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend this party, on the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai Airport.
These stars include the names of Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his Vice poem Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously when such big names are included in the party, you can guess how big this waterfall will be.
325 million dollar rescue package for TAG's health
The Union Government has insisted that strict conditions are also linked to the defense package of  325 million for the health system of Tasmania which will ensure that the state government can not ruin the fund.
Union Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the Commonwealth, the island is taking immediate action to solve the current crisis due to the old population of the state, high rates of genetic diseases and the limitations of the system.
The decision to financing during the four years was made after consultation with Andrew Wilki, independent MP of Tasmania.
Ms. Plybersek said today, "The Government has brought emergency rescue package, which we believe that it will solve the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of  325 million includes an alternative surgery scheme of  31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the previous collected cases.
It also includes funds to start walk-in clinics, better care after going from hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health records system in local hospitals.
Ms. Plybersek said, "This investment is in accordance with the best ways shown by me to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading doctors.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The State will have to maintain the current financing level to get Commonwealth Money and report every month where additional funds are being spent.
The Commission of three members will be constituted to ensure effective and efficient service delivery by the State as possible.
Mr. Wilki said that 325 million dollars will not mean much until real reforms are made to reach Tasmania's public health system at a more commercial level.
Yet, he appreciated the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he brought to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the federal aid package will prove to be very helpful in separating the State Public Health System from the crisis list.
According to the state government, these additional alternate processes will primarily reverse the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "Band-ed solution".
He told ABCTV, "We are here because the Labor State Government has taken  430 million in its health system.

The surveillance group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons
The group monitoring on Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and toxic gas war material, while fierce conflicts emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are considered.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian movement group has said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war started about three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization has happened a day before the last date of November 1 .
Which was determined by the Heg-based organization to mix all the chemical weapons production units and chemicals in toxic gases and destroy the machinery used to fill the war material or make it "ineffective".
Mainly completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious event which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Dumscus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Dumscus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
It is believed that Syria now has 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, which includes master gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The UK situation, the Syrian Observer for Human Rights, has reported that this announcement took place when the conflict in Safira city increased on Thursday, about which experts believe that it is a chemical weapon production unit and as well as a collection center.
The movement group, which had details of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 common citizens, including 6,365 children.
It has been said on behalf of the government that 29,954 President Bashar Assad is a member of the military army, 18,678 are fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 labnies are Hizbullah militants.
It also said that there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters in the dead, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN expressed the estimate that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Asad's military team continued to fight the rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom were related to al-aeda groups.
On Thursday, the observer said that people have been casualties from both sides, but have not clearly said anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war in very short term.
In a statement to the OPCW working with the United Nations, it was said that its party is now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all declared important production and mixture equipment in Syria - destroyed.
It also said, "No inspection activity is being planned.
In the beginning of this week, the inspectors had said that they have completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 out of 23 centres declared by Dumscus.
Observers said that they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, OPC W. said that according to Syria, these two centers have been sacrificed and ... the chemical weapons products kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where OPC inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the overall destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
I salute the firmness and provocation shown by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission done by this organization.
This three-year-old home war is mainly the government of Asad and its security forces, which came out of Shia Islam, including members of the group, and the conflict between the rebel Sunni Muslims.

Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused included Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar located in Haboval, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused used to get papers out of the records of empty and old lands in collaboration with Balbir Singh, the clerk and recordkeeper of the Registrar Office and after that buying new stamp papers and preparing fake registry on them.
Not only that, after disappearing the real registry, the fake registry was carried out in the record.
After this, the accused used to sell land on fake papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, these fake papers used to take loans.
After this, the real owner of the land used to remain a pushing account of the police and administration.
The accused who prepared fake registry kept a special eye on the land of NRIG.
Because there is no one to supervise NRIG's land.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare the fake registry of those lands and sell.
Police Commissioner Gill told that the accused told in the interrogation that they have so far prepared forgery registry about 150.
According to the police, there are cases of fraud and theft against the gangster Rajiv.
Resent on the punishment of plotting bomb blasts in Bali
The family and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb blast in 2002, expressed resentment over the punishment given to the plotter of the bomb blast and said that Umar Patek should face firing team.
Patech, who ran as one of the most desired persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building explosive devices used in bomb blasts.
If parole is given, it can be released in 15 years.
45-year-old Umar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bomb blasts in the church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded the sentence of life imprisonment, although they could also demand that this person, called the infamous "destructive person" as a bomb maker, be the death penalty.
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Parth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patech and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtin told AAP, "He should be raised in front of the firing team."
I have to live every day without my grandfather and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, at 11 o'clock in the night, the nomination of this club was deleted after the bomb blast loaded in the van standing outside the entire club.
Peter Huges was in the padies bar while exploding just 20 seconds ago, the bagpack filled with explosive material by suicide attackers.
As a result of the incident of this bomb blast, he went to a long coma for a month and died three times while living on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Huges says that Patek should have been punished the same, which was responsible for the massacre, three other members of the Jemmah Islamia terrorist group - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Sagara - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
Actually, this person should be given death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive, see, there's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding innumerable people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patech is the last person to be punished from Bali bomb blasters.
He continued to avoid being caught for nearly a decade, but in January 2011, Pakistan's Abbottabad was arrested, where the US Army had killed former al-aeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had presented the evidence that the report showed that Patech was in Pakistan to meet the bill transaction in an attempt to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-aeda.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not surrender."
Even today, it is not really the sadness of hurting all such people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Courtin said, "This year many tears will flow.
Patech can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Aircraft travelers can now use gadget in the aircraft (But can not call from cell phone)
The aircraft will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, sports, movies, music, from entering the gate to descending from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - this is the excessively predicted new guidelines issued by the federal aviation administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Hurta said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
The airlines have to show how their aircraft complete new guidelines, and how their crew members are updating the rules to collect training books and devices to show the guidelines.
FAA has said that it has already received schemes from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and Jetbulu are from those airlines who have already presented plans.
FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can accept the extensive use of electronic device very soon.
At present, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They are expected to not start them until they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and allow them to be allowed by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again while landing on the plane, and do not start it until the aircraft is completely landed.
The FAA said that under the new guidelines, such airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic interruption can allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, land while descending and using devices at taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft which have been revised in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at a higher height are expected to fulfill these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - then it will be a matter of victory for both sides.
When it comes to this issue, we have been bored by feeling like "Hol Monitors".
The agency said that but surfing by connecting internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, email exchanges, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no talks with friends, a game like online scrabal, the famous event related to which is that when the actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the airport park in 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American Airlines had dropped them from the plane.
And heavy devices such as laptops etc. will still be collected because their boom will concern the injury to the other person in the cabin.
The cellphone call will continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory rights related to the phone call are with the Union Communication Commission, not with the FAA.
While flying and descending, FAA can remove restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenkon of National Transport Security Board, who is the National Transport Security Expert of CBS News, said that the cell phone is still considered as a risk.
Rosenkar said, "The cell phones are actually a serious issue, but not because they can probably create obstructions in navigation-related devices, but also because they can create obstructions in cell phone towers when they are in the air.
In order to investigate this issue, the Industry Consultation Committee constituted by FAA has recommended last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce the restrictions from their use.
A critic like Sen Claire McCaskilk, D-M has said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is all-round.
Some studies also indicate that about three-thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when the passengers received reports of interruption in navigation and communication devices due to carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at that time.
New airlines companies are more dependent on the electric system than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to resist electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height from the passengers for many years.
The revised aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interruption.
Hurta said that most airlines companies should meet the eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic device emits very little power radio transmission compared to the previous generation electronic device.
For example, e-readers, there is a total transmission of nominality during the reversal of the page.
But transmissions are strong while downloading or sending data by the device.
Ammon.com is also among those who want to reduce the restrictions on the use of devices by the passengers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test the problems but no such problem was found.
The FAA advisory committee has expressed similar sentiments about the risks arising from the use of the device.
The Duggals Kid of the National Air Travel Traveler Union said that he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is of nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are reports described by the pilot only in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to shut down the devices when the aircraft was landed in less visibility.
The Travel Industry Group welcomed the changes and described them as a common knowledge facility for people traveling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Do of the US Travel Association said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that travelers traveling with joy are not incompatible with defence and security.

Are the higher class of Europe ready to do business with Britain
In April, the Business for Britain was launched and promised to bring business together and determine what we want to see in our relationship with UK Employment and Prosperity Producers EU.
For him, we organized the largest and most detailed survey of British business leaders and asked him what his ideas are about Britain's business with the EU.
The U-Gov took into consideration 1000 business leaders representing UKs business size, areas and places.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of businessmen now want to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while the EU members are becoming dynamic.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not in the long-term and evil process of improving the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When asked about their ideas about specific policy areas such as monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could be easily seen, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far more than the benefits of becoming part of the trade sector of Europe - even 40 of the large businessmen who traditionally favored European companies.
Finally and most obviously, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly seeks to move ahead on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with Britain, EU.
The conclusion, which was seen at the levels of leading business groups, showed that businessmen are inspiring towards a "sufficient transformation" which would refund its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price - Treaty Transformation for Britain and obtaining a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of sustaining the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey is a condition that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the conditions of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to revive a meaningful change in favor of the UK to revive the current power balance.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming very fast compulsory, as Eurozone is moving forward in the direction of affiliated economy and fiscal Union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as the findings of our survey show that for businessmen, a new focused focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation of Brussels.
Gazprom's Alexi Miller described pipeline in Bulgaria as a new round.
Gazprom chief said that the beginning of the construction of South Stream Gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today is a historic incident: Construction started on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and important project in Europe, which was said by Gazprom President Alexi Miller in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a major element of energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russia's export routes in Europe.
Officials said that a dispute relating to the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is part of Europe, offers a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geo-political risks associated with transit countries have ended forever.
After the operation of this entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at relaxed rates from South Stream.
Gajprom said that by the end of the year, construction should be started in other downstream countries.
This pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2. 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two employees of YMCA accused of sexual crimes before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hearing
Prior to the allegations against the careering child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two employees of YMCA NSW have been accused of child sexual crimes.
But in his statement before the Commission, he said that "It has never emerged a case of child sexual harassment inside his organization, it was told to the Commission."
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the matter, in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which YMCA Kairingbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual crime against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, advocate, who helped the Commission, said that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of YMCA before the Commission has been external investigation of YMCA and he has found the YMCA at the forefront of child safety.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified and received the second best rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community uality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with the age of 21, acknowledged that due to appointing the Lord, management has failed, and failed to ensure that the child safety policy was clearly aware of their obligations related to informing the violations.
In the beginning of this year, the Lord was convicted of sexual crimes with 12 children during the two-year tenure of YMCA.
He was given a prison sentence for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the employees did not inform the Lord of child safety violation.
The employees gave the evidence about the violation, in which the Lord spent time with the children alone, personally babiesizing them, sitting in the lap, telling them that he loves them and playing them on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, had asked for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that Y.M.CA. Kairingbah, who supervised the Lord, was very threatened and difficult to meet most of the time.
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that he was not easier to inform above his manager.
He said that, but his friendship with the Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
He said that he had given his vision to the YMCA NSW Mandal that the Jonathan Lord incident was about not giving lessons to the organization.
Mr. Harey said that the decision to sign the secrecy agreement was made by the employees immediately after the allegations came to light, by the Child Service Consultant Leum Whitele of YMCA.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the mixture of evidence, but it was not executed and executed properly.
Stephen Smallbon, special professor of child sexual abuse of Griffith University, said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA was not a safe organization.
He said that there were serious problems in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said that he would like to be the Prime Minister of Britain again - but he believes that there is no possibility of returning.
In an interview taken at night on the fifth anniversary of his farewell from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007, after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair avoided considerably discussing British politics while limiting most of his comments to the role of representatives of foreign affairs and peacekeepers of the Middle East group.
When asked if he would like to come back to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the Evaning Standard newspaper of London saying, "Yes, of course, but it is not likely to happen, so ...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts demonstrating horse for the best horse in Cardif was gathered, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no person was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Just a few months away from taking his first step, Tattu Tafi of this little child and his son-in-law Shetland easily completed three phases and won the top award - he left behind his 30 adult rivals.
In the Annual Competition organised by the Sunback Equatorial Centre at Rudri near Cardif, it was appreciated for the exhibition, behaviour and style of undivided pairs that have lengthened the sky.

The decision makers praised Fenton for his natural skills to control which are far ahead of his age.
And Toffee gets the highest marks for his display and personality.
Toffee was given to Fenton as a gift on his third birthday in March, and since then he has practiced with this tattu of Shetland daily.
Her 30-year-old mother Dona said: "Fanton and Toffee are a grand pair.
They had to face challenges from all the candidates, but they both won gold cups and rosets.
This was the second time when he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all are very happy to win it.
The most different in this colorful land, he felt so amazing that he wanted to take photographs with him.
This younger child of Nantiglo village near Ab Well, South Wales is running on the footprints of his Anti-Sharron Havels, which has been displaying horses for more than 10 years.
Smt. Havelis said: The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating happiness and playing the lock.
He was running on the sand in the whole colorland, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a crazy cattle - she loves horse, tractor and farm, and she has two chickens she takes care of.
The way he has started, he will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long and I am confident that he will perform very well.
The annual horse exhibition spokesman said, "Fanton's age is only three years, but he has to control his tattu."
They are very good pairs.
The decision makers gave marks in view of the methods of performance of Fenton and Toffee and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tattu and his rider - the best in Fenton and Toffee Ring in this case.
I am confident that Fenton's loved clothes have helped him, he was actually looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be revived
A press regulator said that a Chinese newspaper, which had appealed on the page to leave a reporter convicted of defamation, will be revived.
Guangjau's newspaper New Express gave a unique public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjau.
But thereafter, Mr. Chen accepted the television that he had bribed for writing confused news about the partial ownership company of the state.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through complete reforms.
"Sudhar's order came from Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Eving News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company umaloin from September 2012 to August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was unorganized."
He said that it had decided to set up an administrative piece by canceling the license of the reporter of Chen Yongjau.
It had instructed the Yangcheng Eving News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, in the New Express, it had recommended to investigate the people responsible for it and revise the leadership team of New Express immediately.
Mr. Chen wrote a number of articles that blame the financial irregularities in a construction-production company called Jumaloin in New Express.
After being prohibited, his newspaper published two pages of appeal for his release and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to the state television, accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that "In this case, I have harmed Jumaloin as well as the entire News Media industry and its ability to win the confidence of the people."
I did this mainly because I had the greed of money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's forgiveness, New Express issued a forgiveness page in which he said that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have accepted the blame broadcast by T.V.
Experts say that from time to time, blame is strongly accepted, despite this, in the late this year, a law prohibited the officers from binding themselves to blame any person.

US-Mexico Drug Tunnel was found on its own
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between USA and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
US officials have described the tunnel of four feet and three feet as one of the most complex secret routes that have been discovered so far.
The tunnel is equal to the twisted length of about six football pitch, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Digo, USA.
This area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easier to hide the drug-filled truck.
Officials said that it was closed before passing a drug from the tunnel.
According to the court records, officials have seized eight and a half tons of Marijuana and 327 pound cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
Three people, about whom the officials told that they were working as drivers, were accused of being kept Marisuana and Cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, they can be punished from 10 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Noglass, Erizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.

British police sent extradition notice to Assanja
The British Police sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Asange, who has taken shelter in Equator's embassy in London and requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said that he has sent a "dedication notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Association, for which he will have to appear in the police station, and also said that if he fails to do so, he will be responsible for being arrested.
Assemblies are facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual crime charges, as well as their options under the British law ended at that time while the Supreme Court had rejected their appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the US, due to this fear, he had requested the South American country for political shelter, on June 19, in the Equator's embassy in London.

He is in violation of his bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notice.

Tax on foreign property owners will end the artificial situation of London
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but Mr. Osborne is awaiting the final decision, who presented stamp duty at a rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the budget of 2012 and for those who prefer to keep houses in a company rather than a separate person.
In the tax year 2012, the stamp duty received from residential assets in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chellesa was 708 million, which is already more than the joint yoga of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Shri Kuk said: "After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the Associated anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fairest tax on high value property, which has no relation with the effect of the old council tax system.
He added , " But this step has made some foreign investors silent in buying wealth in London and can make it unwilling to sell existing owners .
Primary property, wealth, South-West London, has increased by 11. 8 per cent last year, from top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market, spreading from Phulham to Vimbaldan.
According to Saville's research, the prices of Central London continued to increase by 5.6 per cent every year, but increasingly, the domestic market seems to be slightly less than the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have highlighted the subject that what is the relationship between the dog's tail movements and his mood.
Last research has revealed that happy dogs shake their dumb on the right (in view of the dog), while restless dogs mainly shake their tail on the left.
But now scientists say that companions can identify this microscopic distinction of tail and react to it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellartigara from the University of Trainto said: "In humans all this is well aware that the left and right part of the brain are involved in the excitement that creates positive or negative sentiments.
Here we have tried to see it in other species too.
He said that in the dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and two amateurs played different roles in emotions.
To know more how dogs respond to unilateral shaking by other dogs, researchers monitored the animals watching the films of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb moves on one side and on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra said: "We presented the dogs with the films of dogs - in the shadow picture to deal with the realistic version or other issues in confusion, and we could see the movement of the tail and could present the tail more left or right.
When the animals saw an emotional dog swinging on their tail right (in terms of dog) they were completely comfortable.
But when he saw the tail turning the direction to the left (repeated dog) mainly, his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these movements.
Instead, he feels that the dogs have learned from their experience that they should be worried about what action and not on whom.
He said, "If you have met many times from other dogs, and if they constantly shake their tail on one side, then it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience. "
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about the sentiments of animals to owners, veterinary doctors and trainers.
John Breadshow, a specialist in the behavior of dogs, the guest of the School of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Bristol, told that this is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when the dogs look at an aggressive dog, they turn their heads towards the left and turn their heads on seeing the happy dog.
In other research of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Apparent to the Italian study - when the tail of the robot was moved to the left, then the dogs were more likely to reach near him rather than being restless.
He said that this difference was because in different studies dogs were not fully echoing animals or robot dogs in films.
He clarified that it can help the dogs study the way to respond to real dogs.
"When there is a lot of evidence from different breasts that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still available - and in this case dogs are not exceptional, he said.
However, in view of the ease that their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their dumb moves on one side and on the other.

Pope Francis to announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, Catholic Church consists of supreme categories, their posts are below the Pope only, and these people choose the Pope, so French will select the first group of their individuals, who will eventually assist in choosing their successors.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
However, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope elections - they come in the group of 120 Cardinal Electors.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said in a statement that before the ceremony of promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called Pope Sabha.
Lombardi said, "Pop Francis has decided to tell its decision to organise the February Pope Conference so that plans for other meetings of cardinals participation from different countries of the world can be simplified."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that there was a possibility of reducing the number of cardinal electors by February.
He said that the pop generally, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, the same cardinals, and as per their wishes, the names of cardinals above 80 years of age.
Valero said that the next year's Pope Sabha will be important, because this will be the first pope-seminar after Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It will be interesting to see whether the new pops, the cardinals are nominated from the rest of the world to restore the balance."
There are forty percent Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by France - which is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to find ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Earlier, Pope used to decide all things on its own.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said that "It is possible to seek advice from Francis Cardinals."
But we have not been in this situation - this is absolutely new.
Valero said that usually Pope gives Bishop the post of cardinal to big places, but French was surprisingly surprising - so we do not know whose names they will declare.
GM calls back pickup trucks in US to correct the seatback
According to an information from the US Auto Security Regulators on Friday, General Motors Company, its total new 2014 Sheverley Silverado and GMC Sira Pickup trucks, about 19,000 trucks have been called back to cure a deficiency in the seatback.
There may be a reduction in the system of turning the front seat in some trucks.
As a result, the Sangh failed to comply with auto security standards on seatback, head responsibilities.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Security Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, then it is possible that the head restraint can not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The models were called back from 1st August to 10th September.
The GM trucks began to be sent in June and after the insolvency renewal of 2009, it reflects the most important vehicle launch for the top US automekar.
GM told the truck owners about this defect in the late October.
The NSTMA could not review the Swami notification letter due to the 16-day government captive, which had interrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sera trucks which were re-designed for the year 2014 model year increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.

On Friday afternoon, the share of GM in the New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent.
Obama's disappointment of voters
I voted for Obama twice than a change
They say that due to the policy of blockage of GOP, Obama's great efforts have been interrupted
The barrier policy can not excuse Obamacare website's problems, drone attacks
Obama reminds us of what could have happened in the 2008 campaign .
Nathaniel P. Moris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book about which I feel that this second year will enhance my enthusiasm during the depression of medical school and will wake up the rays of hope in me.
Its name is the courage to win, and it is a memorial of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get frustrated with my patients' leaves at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a round in which politics inspired millions of people and speeches could stop your breath.
Elections proved unilateral, and news speakers had rested to show the historic significance of that time.
My classmates were tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper.
A team of young visionary persons was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
During the formation of Obama's President in 2008, he had 82 percent approval rating.
And then I stopped the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the world of dreams.
It is difficult to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a far-reaching memories, a sad memories of lost opportunities.
For the first time, after voting was done, there was actual change.
Simplely, none of these could have imagined.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, "Do not ask," till the end of Osama bin Laden is killed."
Besides, I believe that the policy of anti-partisanism has prevented many efforts to move ahead of our country, including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, shutdown on Gwantanamo Be.
But innumerable times in which I take the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, the answer ends with me, which I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition policy of the Republican is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It can not answer the collection of data about the private life of common American citizens by the National Security Agency nor can it respond to the prosecution of the people who highlight the wrongdoings of the government.
It can not tell the reason for the killing of American citizen Anwar L Avlaki without any trial, nor the reduction of public funds and expenditure limits during the President's Campaign.
It can not answer the findings of the report, which says that efforts by the White House to quiet the media have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure of designing a simple website even after three years of signing the Affordable Care Act.
I do not know whether I had hoped for it.
If at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance can constitute a political campaign to bring it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a predictable route, because anti-political parties and miraculous incidents such as Newton murder, will shape our public discussions.
Yet, the examples that I have given above are mostly elected by the administration.
This thing troubles you most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidature.
Mitt Romany presented a confusing and an indefinite option, which did not seem to determine their policies or their posts.
I felt that a second tenure for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes that we have been listening for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's following rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return through that book in 2008.
Seeing him, I remember their disappearance promises.
In this week, a part of the book was reading, which described how Clinton was suffering a lot due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
In a Post-Martam Campen Meeting, he spoke to his subordinate employees that they need to return to the tracks and to remain verific on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mozo back.
We should remember who we are.
Today, after five years, I cannot agree with you more.
The ideas expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Moris.

RBS suspended two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its Foreign Exchange Department, which has received information from two persons from the matter, is another indication that the global investigations conducted by regulators in the suspected manipulation of the currency market are progressing at a fast pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including BSF Barcles, Dush Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the regulators in the investigations in the world's largest financial market in which 5.3 trillion is exchanged every day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the investigation of the recurrence of the Libor Interbank Loan Harafar case.
The bank has refused to comment on suspension and confirmed that the bank has received requests from the regulators this month for information.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is continuing in this matter, and we are fully cooperating with the FA and other regulators."
Last month, the experts from the case had said that the RBS was sent to the ex-trader and sent the records of email and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Code of Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Yusher had left the RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been discharged from its current post of European chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader in Barclej and BS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of doing any wrong.
The experts from the case said that Mr. Yusher's quick message group includes barcles and citigroup bankers.
BSF said that after being told by the Swiss regulator, Finama that she is investigating the suspected manipulation of foreign currency market in many Swiss banks, she has taken action against some of her employees this week.
At least six authorities globally - European Commission, Finama, Switzerland's Competition Authorities are examining the allegations of seizures to make their favorable fluctuations in the currency market on the banks of the Department of Justice in VCO, USA and Hag paper monetary authority.
People familiar with the matter said that the USB, City Group, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suis have also examined the internal investigations, or received requests for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely examining a quick message and email for many years in search of a clue of any wrong action.
The news about the investigation has created a disturbance in the trading sector which has been one of the most beneficial individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the last several years, but they have to face the challenge this year because less fluctuations in the currency have reduced the opportunities for stores.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and excessive liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessary that this is true.
Senior trader said that despite the very huge magnitude of foreign exchange purchases, the breakdown of linkivity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of your own platform by the banks means that "you can start affecting the market at a little less ticket price."
This news came on the day when Credit Suis had announced the service deduction of the trader from his Exchange Trade Funds Desk in London this week, which had lost about 6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with their regulators.
Credit Suiss said that "We believe that the trader had worked alone, and it has been controlled."

It is true that our work can not be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for livelihood, but it is not in our interest to accept everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped as the god of money Kuber and death god Yamraj.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Our feelings towards money are good.
The money that comes to the welfare of humanity can not be more valuable than that, but the money that has become the reason for egoism has no meaning.
We earn money for the sacred purpose and spend for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of it should also have the spirit of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unnecessary collection or yen-ken-professional money destroys our discretion, personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in mind.
One part of the money given by you can also be the basis of someone's livelihood.
We all should think for many people living in a terrible lack of society.
In fact, the meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the men of life.
All people wish money and yes and according to their menstruation they also get money and yes.
The same wealth is sustainable, with which respect is connected.
No matter how rich any criminal is, he can neither consume it properly nor can any other work.
If someone else has money, then do not inspire him.
The true wealth is the same which makes the way to flow in innumerable hands of money.
There can be no other use of money from the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, money is not only in the form of currency.
It is also in the form of love for your health, character and others.
Try to become the owner of this money.

After the general elections, if the new government continues to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states these shops will not get kerosene.
The states where kerosene sales are to be closed include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from this, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and North-East are also preparing to close the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Ministry of Petroleum, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene on PDS shops in the states on two basis.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made fast in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made strong preparations about this.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, kerosene quota has been reduced considerably to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kg liter to one lakh kg.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, the news of the shortage of kerosene has not come from these states.
The Ministry is assuming that it is clear from this that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is a difference of Rs 37 at this time.
This encourages adulterers.
In the states where sales will be closed through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market.
At this time oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be about Rs 31 thousand crore.

Then the investor's demat account is opened so that the shares can be purchased and sold for him, but this company named Metatrader-5 was neither connected to any exchange nor did the stock trading.
This company bought the server for itself by citing trading on September 24, 2012 in the name of Vintrade.
Since then, people are being blamed in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight businessmen from Indore have come out to complain in cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their amount was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started demanding profits from the company's workers.

The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to join this company by giving greed to more profits.
After this two lakhs were deposited from someone to five lakh rupees.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, addressed an election rally on Friday and attacked the Congress.
On this occasion, Modi said, "The coalition government was formed in many states and centers of the country, sometimes the Congress, sometimes the government of the communists and sometimes the BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be decided in the country.
What party did
If its comparative result comes, then the question will not come in front of the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is a witness that inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai was low.
The poor man used to get food two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, it was not forbidden to fill the poor man.
A single Congress leader, a single leader of the UPA, is not answering what he did in nine and a half years.
The media of our country can not even reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They also do not answer the media persons.
Elections are from the Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "Come day Modi is being asked questions. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, then every year they will present their account of their work in front of the public.
In democracy, there should be no ruler in Delhi, the servant should sit.
There can be no orphan in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends leave balloons on the day they come.
Congress friends, we have given exams 10 months ago.
In democracy, the public takes the test.
In the case of Nortel Petent, there is an economic case against Google, Sasmang, Huai.
Thousands of former Nortel Petent-owned groups have filed several patent cases against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, whom it had overturned in the Nortel Insolvency auction on Thursday.
A union named Rockstar, who purchased naretel patents in 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Continent Limited, HTC Corporation, Huwai and four other companies for patent violations in US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar ownership is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Ariction and Soni.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
It was said in the charge that these patents also include the technology that connects the words searched on the internet with a coordinate advertisement, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huwai, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huwai and HTC make all these phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which has a tough fight against Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of  900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google, while increasing the bid many times, finally offered  4.4 billion.
After losing the rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility at  12.5 billion, one of the main reasons for which was a long list of patents near Motorola.
It was said in the charge that despite losing efforts to acquire patents-in-suit in Nilami, Google has violated, and is constantly violating.
Rockstar has demanded increased indemnity against Google, because according to the allegation, it claims that violation of patents by Google is incorrect.
First elected independently in Egypt believed in the President
Mohammad Morsi has sworn in assumption of his post, but his victory day could hardly end political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking oath as the first independently elected President of the country, who replaced Hosni Mubarak, removed 16 months ago.
On his formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the first independently elected Islamist President of the Arab world, and almost 60 years ago, the fifth President of Egypt after the removal of democracy.
On his chair, he sworn in front of 18 judges of the court's black-laden swearing-in on the banks of the Nil river, which looked like ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in the live broadcast on national television, Morsi said, "We are aspirations of better future, new Egypt and other Republics."
The fundamentalist group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an illegal organization since its establishment, and who has been on the target of the previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, trained in the US, said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police protected the building and according to the local time, after some time of 11 o'clock in the morning, Morsi came to the small convoy of cars.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new President, the traffic was also stopped for a while so that their motor convoy could leave the normal busy road, which connects the center of the city to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige to ridicule Brotherhood's non-creational empty tire increased after his victory and on Friday, his speech presented him not only as Islamist but also as a candidate of all those who want to fulfill the revolution of 2011 against dictator Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took oath before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber and said that "Today, Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing the national tune, while they were standing in the careful currency.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tuntavi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed the slogan that "the army and people are one hand."
In the year 1908, established as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became the stronghold of Islamist student groups in the year 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic swearing in Tahrir Square, which is the original place of the revolution, which ended the dictatorship of Mubarak last year, and took oath of withdrawing President's powers from his post from the leader removed last year.
But by agreeing to take official oath before the court instead of taking the competent swearing-in of Parliament, they bowed before the desire of the army, which is an indication that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tehri Square was full of dramatic popular currency.

Committee President and Senator Diane Festin said that the program to record NSA's phone is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.

Schools undertake more focus on Mathematics, Spelling grammars
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poem, and contemporary British story after 1914.
In order to encourage more and more reading , the examination will also include ' Non - Searched Text ' .
A joint English literature and language curriculum will be terminated.
Since 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of inspiration to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will issue a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow, which will be the first subject in which revolutionary changes will take place.
It will also change the other major topics next year.
In a different step, the examination regulator will display changes in the structure of the GCSE with the new grading system and less courses.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said that "It was very unanimous that to reestablish the faith of the people, we need to improve our examination system, he said that "GCSE will be more challenging, more ambitious and more hard."
The study found that English schools dedicate less time in mathematics - 116 hours in a year or 3 hours in a week in comparison to most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours in one year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
However, there is no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the combination of comprehensive mathematics with the topics in the GCSE-league table was likely to encourage additional education in schools.
This curriculum will focus more on the problems of the real world, including financial math.

The names of the people who came after a long time from other parties have been recorded in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, then some make life ideal with their hard work and people inspire them.
In the same persons, one name comes from Self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third in five brothers and sisters.
Five children of the family include Ramiklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumti.
Due to economic disturbances, Dhirubhai had to leave studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai had started financial helping the house in childhood.
At this time, he used to set up a buzz shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, at the age of 17 in 1949, he reached Eden city of Yemen with a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting jobs abroad.
But there was something else in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, he returned to Vatan.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try luck by putting 500 rupees in the pocket.
And his business journey started from here.
Dhirubhai Ambani has taken such steps from here that he never looked back.
His name was not only famous in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handled by his kingdom.
Like father, today the name of these two brothers is also among the international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today

Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was included in his cabinet while being the Chief Minister.

I live in Shopian, called the stronghold of the terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was posted at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are also bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday.

But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate this matter.
Of course, when IGP Abdul Gani Mir of Kashmir was contacted in this context, he denied the information of this matter and said that this is a sensitive matter.
I myself will investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my information.

I am in Jammu this time I am coming to Kashmir in the next one or two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Rather, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), during the PM of Atal Vihari Bajpayee, a round came when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
While laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182 meters high 'Statu of Unity' statue in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "After this there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM Candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of members of Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tewari asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertisement.
Because the price of advertisement depends on many things, including the size of advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, whose protesters are trying to handle the heritage of a great leader without knowing about it.

Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, is providing free healthcare in the rural areas of Cameron
Well and their team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend .
West African countries don ' t have very much doctors , there is only one doctor for 5000 people .
Give your vote here or give it through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or anybody in other top 10 to make the CNN year's hero.
The winner will get  250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Wayle came to his sick father's senses and was unconscious, visiting the hospital, which was not able to help them properly.
Jamel Well, in the year 1981, was injured in a car accident near Cameron's capital Yonde.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased which spread to his mind, and he built a bleeding, which affected his rest of his life.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron."
If we had money, we would take our father out of the cameraon.
Instead, Vel kept roaming around the highly crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and continued to get the treatment that he could get.
Well said, "This is not easy."
You come out of the house at 5 o'clock in the morning that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can wait in the mouth of death while waiting.
Since Vel's father's death in 2002, there was not much change in the situation.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 person in Cameron.
If compared, then in United States, there is a doctor for every 413 persons.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameron can not bear his expense.
Two out of five people in the country have won below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is from the private sector.
Well says, "His only problem is poverty.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the sufferings of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolution to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon in Yonde's Central Hospital.
He also launched non-profit organization Escovime which goes to rural areas on weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tied medical supply to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck does not even happen to them.
They have to move forward more than once by pushing the vehicle from rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get respect for the heroes: the best housing to be presented by the feast, singing and dance, and the community.
Free medical service in these villages is actually a cause of celebration, and Well, with its big smile and uninterrupted energy, is happy.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We are meeting 500 people in every journey.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekends clinics provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get basket, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is required in the school but many poor families can not afford it.
In the evening, the party does simple surgery with local signature.
Operations are generally done at school buildings, town halls or houses, after the process, the patient walks to the recovery place and makes a place for the next person.
The generator of the group publishes the operation room and the sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work in the morning on Sunday.
This is a bitter speed, but the musicians of the village usually help in motivating the party.
Well said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Cameron doctors and foreign medical students - has done 700 free surgery last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
A person said that due to free hernia surgery, she will be able to go back to work.
The person said, "This will change the future of my and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgery in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He said that this is his second job which financing 60 of his non-profit work, the remaining part is fulfilled by private donation.
In Philadelphia, the second year medical student of Draxel University and volunteer in Vel's group, Catty O'Mally said, "I do not know when they sleep.
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medical and nursing like O'Mally, who come from United States and Europe to join Vel's campaign, have this experimental opportunity, which they can never get in their country.
O'Mally said, "We have been able to get experimental experience in the surgery that we help to catch tools for Dr. Well or clean blood veins."
You will never get the opportunity to do this as a second year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameron, and they often come with the medical supply of donor.
But after reaching Yonde, they have to stay and go, and take the cost of instructions.
O'Mally says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameron is never going to end.
For Well, there is not a burden of almost the same work, difficulty.
To help others live a happy life, fulfill the promise made to their father, these are those things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I am very happy while doing this work."
And I think about my father.
I hope they're looking at what I'm doing.
I'm laughing at people, to reduce their pain.
See the website of Escovim and find out how to help.
You might not be sure but this is true.

He said, "Congress has become so egoistic that it does not respond to media questions.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs a reply from Modi.
It is your duty to answer the public.
Clearly, Modi was answering Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his controlled atmosphere where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.

In unexpected acceptance, John Kerry said that the US espionage has gone far ahead inappropriately.
John Kerry, by accepting it unexpectedly, has indicated that the US's security attitude on its monitoring program has become soft that sometimes its spy "inappropriate" goes far ahead.
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty of Barack Obama in the case of being on an automated pilot as a rebellion to the informer Advert Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities.
This revelation has brought the US government diplomatic rivalry in relation to its allies.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Shri Kerry said, "There is no question that the President, I and others in the government really knew about some things happening with the Automatic Pilot, as they look back to the second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, in 911, there was definitely a potential.
He has become the first high-class member of the US government, who has admitted that the US espionage has crossed its border, but has insisted that nobody's rights have been misused.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone far ahead inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make an effort to clarify it and is still reviewing intensively so that there is no sense of misuse in any person.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry stressed that, however, NSA was trying for good purpose, and its monitoring has saved the lives of many people.
He further said: "We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are capable of stopping it before it happens
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, demolishing buildings and killing people because we have been able to know about the plans of others.

Chris Merfi, Senator of the Connectivity, said that he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and he is worried about the threats of preventing participation by them in anti-terrorism organizations due to confusion over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
In an interview with Washington, the President of the Senate Foreign Convention of European Affairs, Murphy, who was elected for the first time in the Democratic Party, said, "It is actually important for US national security interests that in terms of our anti-terrorist efforts, European countries are with us.
To clarify that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger over the NSA program.
The reports of NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have brought bitterness in relations with some US allies, though the agency chief said that these reports are not completely correct, and reflects the misunderstanding of Metadeta shared with the United Nations, organized by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Agenla Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the incident of spying on allies and said that it is common to do so by both sides.
Between the ruckus, Murfi said that his office is arranging a Congress visit which is likely to happen this year, and he expressed hope that the delegation will include members of both parties and members of both the chambers.
The names of other strategists participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the travel program.
While Merfi said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "practical relations" have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will have to be honest to their spying programs used for years with their people.
Merfi said, "Although we can amend our monitoring program to protect the rights of European people better, they also need to agree that we are not the only one who are spying.
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit Middle East and Poland, where he will solve the discussions between US strategy and US monitoring activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
New politics of changing the board has started in the municipalities.
Recently, Trinamool's board was converted into a board due to changes in the board councilors of the Congress leadership in the Sanithia Municipal Corporation of Virbhum district.
This change took place due to the involvement of most of the Congress councilors including the municipal chairman in the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but also some councilors of CPI (M), CPI and Forward Block have also suppressed Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai considers it auspicious sign for the party.
They say that 10 Congress councilors including Sanitia Municipal Corporation Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta joined the Trinamool.
Some councilors of the Left Front, including the CPI (M), have also taken the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and according to the number force, the Sanitia Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI (M), CPI and Forward Block are moving forward to join Trinamool Congress.
Welcome to the Trinamool of any party's worthy leaders.
Prior to the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, due to the change of party of Congress councilors in the Sanitia Municipal Corporation, the occupation of Trinamool on the municipal board is considered to be important in political circles.
Earlier, in the Left Front-ruled Haldia and Nadia, there is an example of the occupation of Trinamool on the Congress-ruled municipal board.
When Trinamool is occupying the party due to the change in the municipal board in the districts, those who join the party are welcomed in the Trinamool Bhavan located in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about joining the Trinamool by breaking the other parties.
They say that those who have broken from any party are welcomed in Trinamool.
He claims that people's faith under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI (M) says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being scared.
Fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress, people are joining it.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is considered to be an injury to the CPI (M) democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base, but it is imperative to question the justification for changing the vote in the matter of power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai Prison Period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in Phuket to make false allegations of attack on a taxi driver, she has appealed against this decision and she has got bail.
On June 15, the Fuket Provincial Court found Stevey Rassel Bombford guilty of making wrong allegations against the Thai Police, alleging that on Sunday morning, a local taxi driver had tried to stop it with two other persons.
But later, CCTV footage revealed that he had returned to the hotel safely after separating from his Australian boyfriend.
Fucket police accepted the story after inquiring from the Bamfort for two days.
Before hearing in the court, he was kept in the local police cell.
The Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment at the Low Security Prevention Centre in the outskirts of Phuket instead of adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunx, who has requested the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunx told Sydney's Sunday telegraph that the whole family is very worried about the care of his daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tunks said that "Undoubtedly this has been a worrisome time for us, but we hope it will be at home as soon as possible."
Bamfod has appealed against the order, and bail has been granted on 50,000 excuses.
During this time, the report in Australia said that he was celebrating holidays in the southern Thailand to celebrate Crabby's holiday.
Legal sources in Thailand said that the case of Bamford was being fought by a local advocate in Fuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court can increase its bond order for two years and force him to stay in adult jail.
However, after the assassination of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Fuket recently, Thailand can also blame for attempting to improve its bad tourist image.
