There are revolutionary movements even before Bhagat Singh.
However, Bhagat Singh and his companions have given a new dimension and clear ideal to revolutionary movements and through this.
Even today, we can see that the revolutionaries are just blind and unconscious about human beings.
The era of Bhagat Singh shows us his manifestation and clear thoughts and capability.
In April 1929, the name of Bhagat Singh was spread in India after the legislative bombing programme.
A little later in Tamil Nadu was introduced to the public in 1930.
But within a year, his fame has spread rapidly in all corners of Tamilnadu.

'If he had decided that he would have been on the right path, we would have said that if he had decided that he would have done the right way to fulfil his policies, and that he would not have been able to say that if he did not happen, he would have been a reasonable man.
So now we call him a real man.
It is our strong analysis that Bhagat Singh's policy is really important for India.
If Shri Bhagat Singh does not drive away his life, then this success will not be the source of such a popularity.
We say that if Bhagat Singh had not been able to snatch away, Gandhiji would have been created yet.
The mother had to give her life to show the real equity and peace of the people of the world to the people of India that she had to be sick and slaughtered by her.
We appreciate Bhagat Singh's heart, vayar and Kayar, saying that nobody else can reach us ordinarily.
In the Republican Literature Literature, Father Periyar said.

Can the Chief Minister Eddapadi Panichsamy, who is responsible for the public works sector, speak against the truth without knowing that
The blockage built in Mayanur led to the increase in the water resources of the earth in that area.
That's why agriculture was prosperous.
Therefore, I am glad that thousands of people of this region, who are now benefitting from this region, have been grateful to the corporation government.
According to the requirement of that period, the corporation government had immunized in Mayanur.
There was no need to build more restrictions.
If there was a need, the artist who was then the Chief Minister would have given it permission immediately, would have distributed the money and dragged the job.
That's why it's not very close to neutralizing the corporation's government in maintaining the interests of the US.
I ask you, how many immunizations have you been built in the last eight years of the ADM regime
Secondly, we have built more than 40 dams in Tamil Nadu during the divine regime.
Can you point out that a single dam has been built in the ADM regime so far
Don't lie.
If the opposition leader is in response to his allegations, tell the evidence where we are planning to build or build immunity.
I am obliged to indicate that it is not a civilizational activity, not a civilizational activity, but a civilizational activity,' he said.

Is it Bhajaka who handles the caste politics in Tamil Nadu
It is said that in Tamilnadu, wherever it is not clean, the caste politics is finally taken into the hands of the people.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, he was in a position to switch off in Tamil Nadu.
After that, for the second time, when the Empire was held, Amitsha denounced, "Why don't you know, the lord should grow up in Tamilnadu."
However, only five of the contested constituencies were able to cover the soil.
Though all over the country, there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
Besides this, Triple Talaq, Kashmir Dispute, Hindi Discipline, One Nation, One Language.
Since all this is mixed, it's still in sweetness.
That's why the BJP's leadership on Tamil Nadu's bureaucrats is in a rigorous position, and that is why it is said that even the state's leadership has become unsuccessful.
Even if this is on one side, the Bhajaka plan is to root out in Tamil Nadu in any way in the forthcoming assembly elections.
For this, a direct field report and intelligence report appears to have led the Bajak leadership for nearly one decision.
Accordingly, there is a feeling that there is no greater importance for the people of the Nation and the people of the Vaniyar and the people of the Devendra Kul.
This is also said to be annoying the PAPs.
This is what has begun to be done in the hands of the people.

Moreover, one thing that cannot be forgotten in the politics of this caste can be forgotten for the masses.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu is already in caste politics, it is not known whether these functions of Bhajaka will be like adding more oil to the burning fire.
It is true that if the tribe of Tamilnadu has started fluttering, there will be a slightly blossoming limestone in Tamilnadu.
