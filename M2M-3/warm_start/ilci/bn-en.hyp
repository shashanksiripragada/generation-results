Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes, it's different.
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of both in languages .
This language is called Kachhi .
Although there is no script of this language .
If you want to write the knife then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Near the ground itself is that Anjar city where earthquake occurred many times and the whole city was destroyed .
Near Anjar itself is the tomb of Jasal - Torali .
The story of Jessel - Torali is very thrilling .
If I want to return on that way then we will have to take a second month 's holiday and the school will open there in Bombay .
Then what can be done  This time I will travel to the train by moving fast buses of Gujarat .
From Bhuj a small train of metrogen reaches Rajkot .

According to the main basis of the economy of Rajasthan tourism industry is going through very bad conditions nowadays .
Due to the danger of increasing terror in Manda and South Asia there has been a deep impact on tourism business .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted in the major states of the country has been seen very less .
According to the recent figures published by the Government of Rajasthan in 1990 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan decreased by 10 percent in comparison to 2008 .
According to the number the number of national tourists is 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists is 27 . 36 percent less .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists came to Rajasthan in comparison to the total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists .
Of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 national and 73 lakh 414 foreign tourists were there .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
The director of Rajputana Holiday Makers Sanjay Kaushik said that due to business depression and incidents of terror tourism business has been very badly affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong based structures and structures in our country .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India is 3 . 29 percent less than the previous year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan the number of tourists coming from France is the highest .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
From the point of view of tourism this year has passed a lot .
After 2000 this time the number of tourists of Rajasthan has decreased for the first time .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests all are kept in ancient state for tourists .
To work on the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , thrilling tourism in the field of tourism all the governments have increased but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less chances .
Foreign tourists along with women have also made the pictures of this state even worse in the last few years .
The Rajasthan government had given the guidance of tourism industry in the state several years ago but it was limited to paper only .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government towards tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1997 .
This corporation provides the facility of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc . to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units in this corporation .
Of which 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight cataracts , three passenger cars , one passenger united and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels , but the condition of this company has been worse for some years .
In 2008 - 1992 the loss of RTDC was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotel of this corporation is such that in the last five years forty percent houses of this hotel have not been filled .
Along with the hotel other units of the corporation also faced great losses .
Among these the main is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This rail has not made the attraction of tourists .
Even after decreasing rent it could not attract tourists .
In such a situation the interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair has been seen less .
In 2007 - 08 the number of tourists in the tourist village made from the point of view of RTDC has decreased to 217 this year where 398 foreign tourists stayed .
In the middle of all this the satisfactory point for RTDC is that palace on wheels i . . the royal train has shown some deficiency in the attraction of tourists .
There is relief from this railway .
In the last year RTDC has received Rs . 9 . 5 crore from this railway .
It is natural to be worried by the loss of tourism in Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest source of Rajasthan economy .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of the person then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy proved it by making a modern city Ambo Valley in the Sahadri mountain range of Maharashtra .

His pleasure was seen at the time of the inauguration of his own airport of Ambo Valley .
The work of Ambo Valley started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place in the form of a beautiful city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been made on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other benefits have been provided .
Many entrepreneurs come forward to build their houses in this city built for millions of people and today around 800 families are staying in this city .

Some other ruins have been found in the Lohir district of Arunachal .

The necessity of these satches is fulfilled from the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight is on the left side in the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges towards the light lalima of the stomach in the hungry sky .
The wind is very cold .
Along with winters one feels humidity in the weather .
Beneath the trees the rocks spread on the wooden threads are seen on the rocks of the wood .
Nothing is seen more in the weather because of moisture and humidity before sunrise .
The sight gets stuck on the lymph nodes of the east .
He wants to sit on the bench kept in Baranda .
The shining sound of the shiny level of the palm starts shining with the hand and the hand gets removed as soon as the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from its country on this hill covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience in the life of spending the night in this small village .
This is my third migration in Swiss.
Before this more time was known or spent near it .
Located in the valleys on both the sides of the Saru river the dense population is spread on the light slope to a great extent .
This is the main river of Switzerland , the valley of Ron , on both sides of which many small and big cities are located .
The cars are clearly visible on the roads and roads along with the Ron river .
The journey of 300 kms by car and half an hour is connected to the Geneva lake , which is called French Lake Lama , near the city named Montro , the Ron river coming from the east with the transparent and half Ron river .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide this lake is situated on the western side of the Jeneva city .
The lakes here again move towards the west through the river .
The mountain ranges of Dhabal , Gaganchumbi Alps along the Daily and Lake .
After crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left the highway on the left side and reached on the hilly path of the north .
Due to the slopes of the mountain being southward the sun gives full sunshine at noon .
In comparison to valleys the quantity of snow here is often not less .
As the height goes towards the height the density of snow increases .
Despite good snow being frozen on both the sides of the road due to clean sky and shining sun there is no special cold in the air .
After finishing the journey of about 20 kilometres on this rotating hilly road we reached a small village named Thal .
Shail : This is the big and big multi-storied bungalow made of full wood with slopy roofs .
Along with the arrangement of lodging of cars in the basement made of cement contract of this three storey bungalow there are also rooms for controlling the necessary services like cart , water , laundry .
Switzerland is famous for grape cultivation .
It is the main center of making wine grape alcohol .
Grapes are produced on 37  of the entire cantonment .
The gardens of vineyards in the village situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley give a marvellous way to the beauty there .
Travelling , roaming in the gardens of grapes , resting at night in the villages there and taking into the factory of making wine wine wine is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a large museum of grapes in a palanquin built in 12th century in a small town named earlier , to see which foreign tourists keep booking premiums .
Once again we are going through the jungle of the desolate jungle in Daban .
The road till three - four kms was getting worse in the question of children .
That is why the dramatic and charming change of the view comes in a turn .
Right in front , on the top of the deep valley on the left side of the road there are many houses .
People are skiing on slopes above the village .
On the skiing slope the dense forests of cedar are spread till the head of the mountains .
There is dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the settlement are shining wearing the sun rays .
Within five minutes we reached the village .
This moisture is also spread here .
All around from the peaks of the mountain to the valleys the empire of white snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round circular in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is leukerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Liukarabad is approximately 1500 .
For staying in 1700 apartments and shawls with capacity of 6900 beds here , 28 hotels , camping sites for tent leaves , 90 bed health centers and 50 restaurants we can estimate the number of tourists , sportspersons and patients coming here .
Till now a total of 65 yields of hot water have been found in Lukarabad .
Out of this 40 lakh litres -LRB- everyday -RRB- of hot -LRB- 51 cm -RRB- water can be reached at around 30 thermal pools made at places , some pools are in five star hotels and pocket followers of different age groups .
On reaching the village one feels hot feelings .
On the roofs of houses in the bright sun the thick level of snow is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the reserved places in Switzerland in the form of reconstruction of national heritage .
It was said in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only go to taxi therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the region is other , but the mountains are the same , the trees and trees are also one , the air is also one .
The moisture of the whole body is also one .
During rainy season brightness is also one .
As soon as the plan of Darjeeling journey is fixed it is decided to take the table of Karsang first .
Karsang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens full of dust jungles .
Best tea is famous for production .
On going towards Darjeeling from Siliguri first tea gardens welcome you in a joyous manner .
In the middle of tea gardens the heart became enchanted for the first time on going through the road .
On one side green mountains full of jungles and on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
Empire of greenery all around .
Once I had fallen into difficulty - I will not see these natural jungles this tea tree planted by humans .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful the jungle was as beautiful as the tea gardens spread .
On looking at the road the creation feels amazing .
Travelles like snake rice and turning roads were going .
Time was also going on .
What was not cut is jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements appear .
From a distance a hilly house , etc . were seen to be very dense .
This was Carsong .
Staying here at one place we made programs of roaming throughout the day .
That is why we went out to roam Karsang with a car .
Deer park is the first .
A small garden is surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the deer park we had to leave the car below a lot .
Despite being full of beauty Karsang has not yet been developed or famous in the form of tourist spots .
Although the city is very clean .
Despite being desolate the road the joy of climbing the road between the loving and smooth trees to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles was enjoying us .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point situated at a height on the other side of this city .
This is called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to commit suicide by jumping from here .
Nowadays it is connected to a park and restaurant .
There is a dome here from which the view of the whole city can be seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women are capable of making tea leaves at a rapid pace by taking a toker on the back .
There is an exhibition outside the Carsong city , but on that day we could not go there because in tea gardens the tour of open weather appeared to be very important .
The next day it was decided to visit Darjeeling .
This place was very thrilling but there was a greater concern than this that how would we roam around while raining like this .
But the connectivity was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we could enjoy the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
Going a little below from here the Gangamaya surrounded by mountains will be found .
Here the shadows of waterfalls in the middle of the stones are worth seeing .
We were seen in the Rock Garden that waterfalls are decorated in the empire of stones here and the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya rocks .
These two places are present in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
We saw the air loop in Darjeeling by lifting up by car .
From here the entire hills and cities of Darjeeling can be seen with the help of television .
The mess of the weather was still good .
But the way we moved towards the monastery we knew where the clouds came and rolled and started shining .
In the evening plans of walking and shopping are made in Malroad .
In the journey of Darjeeling the journey of toy train makes it even more attractive .
From Darjeeling to sleep and journey from sleep to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
There is a slight rest in boating and garden in the Mirik lake here .
Tourists go to Pashupatinath Bazar also on this way , where sweets made by Nepali artisans etc . are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its colors are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens but the sound of jungle - waterfalls is here .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolehgaon , which are full of jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time I could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in winters but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling here bind me on their own .
One of my recent journeys was very thrilling and charming .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , was very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a thrilling thing in which sometimes the journey attracts us then sometimes some special place , water ship or a royal train or a lake palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place where I am going to talk has been built about four and a half years ago , but the preparations that this place has been built are really worth seeing in the jungle .
Not only for those who go there but also for those who stay there .
Even today in my ears we were not able to think of my guide Ram Babu Meena before that we could stay in such a way in my jungle .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work in Heritage Hotels .
Ram Babu dwelling in Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur before and now this is a royal garden .
He has made his walking and talking new in a different structure .
Sahiba is the hustle-bustle of Aman Bagh .
There nobody engages you in English .
Aman Bagh is actually a peaceful and comfortable place .
This garden has its own history and the biggest thing is also introduced to the nearby areas .
There is no need to go far , very few among the people of Jaipur may have spent nights in this area .
After opening such gardens many big people of the country and abroad have come here .
I remember that night when Shabana Azmi invited me there but I couldn't go.
It is different from this that he had reached Bhangarh by forgetting his way .
This time suddenly I reached there to invite my foreign guest , those who want to spend a good holiday for less time should go to such gardens .
This garden is one of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to take rest for hunting .
It was built in nineteenth or twelveth .
Its old walls are witness to those days .
The first sight of Aman Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees will hypnotise you .
The way you will be welcomed in which you will feel that there is a focus on divine peace here .
With the Mauli Dam in hand the magnificent supervision of Manglachar is done .
We reached in the evening and we decided to put a cycle of the garden .
My table sister Jackie told me with a decorator that it is very charming .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is the library here .
Everything is new and artistic . It is not surprising that Aman Bagh has been given prizes in recent times .
The manager made our program right for the morning .
First of all I walked on foot with Ram Babu and then roamed in Bhangarh jeep .
While walking on the way to Kankad we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
I saw the Sukhi lake in which the peasants are cultivating .
This year there was no rain but for the first time I saw the production of tobacco .
The opportunity to see rural life was very pleasant for Jackie .
After this we went to Bhangarh by jeep .
In the morning we saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep meditation .
It's a million dollars.
While leaving such a garden they told us by eating jaggery and curd in traditional waves .
Now we got to know why tourists come here to spend so much .
I have heard that tour packages are also prepared to see the lives of tribals .
Is it right
Surely this is done in not only in many states and tourists give special encouragement in this tour .
This tour is generally made for four days to two weeks and this time tourists are taken to different places .
Among these staying there , eating etc . are also inclusive .
This way attempts are made to roam such places where there is no very much development and there is no special effect of time on nature and lifestyle of people .
Along with this old tourist sites etc are also there .
Besides this concentration is also given on feeding nutritious food .
Actually the purpose of this kind of tour is to face the activities and traditions of the tourists in all these places .
Although it looks a little difficult to think , but such a tour is really a thrilling and a different kind of experience .
There is a different joy of tour by bus .
Despite being with many you can enjoy staying alone .
Not only this in this journey you can read for a long time without obstruction of your favorite books .
Yes , it is right that along with spending a lot of time in less cost and peace this tour also demands all of you .
To enjoy this tour it is important to remember some things especially when you are watching any foreign place by roaming in the bus .
Find the best deal before taking ticket .
Students , senior people , children etc . get rid of this tour and there is arrangement of leave for both .
Although buying tickets from before is somewhat cheap therefore in the end it is better to do bus tours than plans .
Instead of taking tickets on both sides get information about round trips .
It falls cheap .
Materials related rules are specially done so ask about the weight and weight of the goods .
It does not happen that you have to leave your things in the terminal or to pay increment .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or losses from the tour company .
Carry on bags take the right , for this tour .
Because it gets stuck on the top of the seat .
Keep in mind this thing that while changing the bus the responsibility of the goods is yours .
From where you reach the bus reach one hour before the scheduled time .
You should keep this in mind especially in the busy season .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will get a better seating place .
Keep in mind while selecting the place of sitting .
There is more tremors towards the back and they are unable to fall properly towards the front .
If you go to the bathroom again and again then take a place towards which and if you do not like to be more disturbed then it is better to take a seat towards the window .
This time there's a challaki.
If you are trying to wind both then first put your bag in the nearby seat sitting in the corn seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then this plan will be successful .
If there is facility of bathroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing while selecting the seat because after some time sitting there becomes difficult .
Interact with the bus driver or conductor .
By this you will get to know many important information .
Everyone is called to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time you will not leave your luggage in the place because on losing it people do not take the responsibility of it .
Wherever the bus stops come back at the right time .
If you do not come time then you can take a new passenger and you will have to wait for other buses on the terminal .

It is not even known when you suddenly get up in the air while running like a speed boat on the water .
On the whole flight you will feel the ride on the normal plane .
You will always be seen below - Resort Island and Prabal Island are seen in different kinds of blue colors of Maldives .
Everything is so clear .
There are two C plane companies in Maldives .
Translation is one of them which has twenty C planes .
If you want you can roam around around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an hour or the entire C plane can be rented for tour throughout the day -LRB- for that there should be a tax zone -RRB- .
If you go from Malai Island to any other island then the journey of C plane will be necessary because that is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which you will never want to end .
The journey of C plane from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the east -RRB- is done on Maldives island .
We were in the shops of the capital Antique and Swineer in the Agadi market of Mal .
All Salesmans were listening very carefully to the speeches given by the President of Maldives in Copenhagen a day before .
In reality I have not seen any Indian speaking President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of creating a new existence on this earth then it is necessary to be so serious .
Many people will feel like going to Maldives even after meeting on the surface of the water by the cabinet of Maldives in October if the wrath of nature snatches it from us then how poor will the world become .
There is a special thing in the beauty there .
This small country does not seem so beautiful .
From that tour of the market while going back to the jetty to return to the cruise when I realized how much the people here understand the value of this beauty .
The water is so clear that in the light of lamppost colorful fish is being seen several metres deep .
This is that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
You are fortunate to see some centimetres clearly in the sea or river water connected to any city of India .
On coming to Amby Aquamirin the evening spent in the jewellery drowned in two hours .
Koral Rif -LRB- Munga rock -RRB- is the life here .
Even you will get an answer on the crematorium .
Just a while before listening to President Nashis we were standing outside his government residence .
It is not believed that we were in front of the highest personality of any country , no security personnel could be seen far and wide .
We were funny taking the drops of the garden just fifty metres away from the doors of its bungalow .
Can you think about the houses of any leader in India
It was also known that both the blocks went to their department before crossing the road on foot .
Everything we feel about Maldives .
That is why we were waiting for Brussels the next day .
It seems that this day will be special .
In the morning we took a boat from Cruise and took our airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the rocks of the queen .
Last evening when the cruise reached near the goods then we got to know the air going up immediately .
I saw a lot of pictures.
But then did you know that the next day I will get the opportunity to ride on this plane .
We were going to Rangoli island at a distance of five kilometres through the C plane of Trans Maldives .
The view of thousands of resorts and Koral islands spread over the sea of Maldives on this sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres was unforgettable .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
In thrill and excitement there was a flight like breathing stop .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangoli Island we felt as if we had come to some other world .
In such a world which has no relation with the outside world .
There was no such relation that it was difficult to get out the beauty and beauty available here .
The tour of Konark can also be done on foot or by battery driven vehicle .
From Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was amazing .
Even now we could not get up with the nature around , we reached such a place which was impossible .
After descending down several metres below the stairs we reached such a house of glass which was under the water .
This house was actually a food hall .
On all sides of the glass were seen the small and big fish , coral , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating sitting on a decorated shoes there is very thrilling .
On coming to this island from Male to Plane the fare of underwater lunch is 47 thousand rupees per person .
I did not want to return from there .
We were ready to weigh our passport in water .
But I knew it was not possible .
I came back with the hope that sometimes , sometimes fate will definitely come here .
I was planning to go out of Delhi for a long time but because of the busyness of work it was not possible .
There was a lot of fondness of wild life in childhood so I thought that this time we should go to Jim Corbett .
In 2006 before the Khardungla pass in Ladakh this was the second bike tour after biking till Penang Lake .
On 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that I took out had reduced our speed .
The road between Hapur and Gajrola was very tired .
On that there is a ruthless and bad way again .
Many times it felt that we would fall .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park was 20 kilometres before Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Tikuli near the park , which we had booked beforehand .
There was no specific program that day , despite winters we went to roam around Kosi first .
After staying there for two-three hours we left for the Corbett Museum which was near the Ghangdi Gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to Ramnagar below .
We went back in the evening .
I came out firmly from Delhi that I would definitely see tigers roaming in the jungle but I saw tigers in dreams all night .
Suddenly in the deep of the night I could hear a loud voice and then the dog which began to scream in the dog kept on walking for two hours .
Initially the advice of roaming black pepper and carbonate fruits came .
Kaladungi is 30 kilometres away , Corbett Falls falls on the way .
There are exhibitions of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his life are kept .
We went back at 12 . 30 o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village only .
After reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It is said that they have made arrangements for sighting in number one .
It is said to ask about number one that there are more grass and tigers here to escape from cold this time .
On reaching Bijrani a guide is given to us that to roam around for four hours one and a half hundred rupees will be taken .
We had to go inside for the jungle .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw elephants of both teeth , whose long teeth were .
I photographed on the ground.
In the middle the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are about 150 tigers in the park , in which many died in a few days .
At many places we saw the marks of the legs of the tiger , but on not getting the sight of the tiger the mind was getting worse .
On the third day we were returning to Delhi .
There was a tiger ' s ghost in my head .
That is why I remember an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him the same way.
I told him I came to Corbett.
He asked if I saw the tiger .
This thing of her was bound like a shore .
I said slowly that I didn't see it.
There was no permission to take bike in the park .
One told us to take a ride to roam inside .
