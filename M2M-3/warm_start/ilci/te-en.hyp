Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , others .
On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of two in language as well .
It is called ' kachhi ' .
Although there is a language speaking here , it has no inscription on its own .
If you want to come to Kutchi then you will have to write in Gujarati script .
Near the shoulder is that Anjar city where earthquake came several times and the whole city was ruined .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very charming .
If we returned on that path only then we had to take a monthly holiday again and schools were opened there in Mumbai .
But what did we do  Now we traveled in the train by telling taxi for fast buses of Gujarat .
Small rail going through meter gauge reaches Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge reaches Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad the big train of broad gauge reaches Mumbai .
The tourism system considered on the main basis of the economic system of Rajasthan is spending in a very uncomfortable situation these days .
Due to the dangers of increasing intensity in Vaishvik Mandi and South Asia tourism system has become very less .
With the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased very much these days .
It has been said that in 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to the figures the number of tourists of the country has decreased by 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 foreign tourists and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists participated .
There are two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 foreign tourists and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists .
People associated with tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , the founder of Rajputana Holiday Mekers , says that due to the incident of Vaishvik Mandi and intensity the tourism system has completely affected .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not developed the tourism system here strong and baselessly .
Because of this the number of foreign tourists coming to India also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan France is the highest among the tourists .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has passed a lot of years .
This first time after 2002 is the deficiency of the number of tourists of Rajasthan .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , buildings , forts , ponds , jungles , everything is as old as to enjoy tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments say the words of working with the name of village tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism are very important but nothing has been done in this direction .
The facility of tourists coming to Rajasthan is also very less .
At the same time by foreign women tourists in Rajasthan in recent years incidents of violence and humiliation have also taken the beauty of this state to international level .
The Government of Rajasthan has given the status of tourism in Rajasthan a few years ago but it has become limited to only papers .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism is Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation .
With the aim of increasing the number of tourists in Rajasthan and developing them based on tourism the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 AD .
This branch provides the convenience of accommodation , food , commutation , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 branches in this institute .
Out of these 39 hotels , 22 motors , eight motoria , three journeys , one unit journey and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan wheels , but the situation of this institute has also remained behind for many years .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakhs and in this year there is a possibility of increase in 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of hotels of this institute is such that in the last five years even forty percent rooms were not filled in these hotels .
Along with hotels other branches of the institute are also harming it a lot .
The main among these is Royal Rajasthan of Views .
Tourists are unable to attract this train .
Even after reducing the fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly during the time of Pushkar fair also the favoriteness of the tourists has been seen less .
In the year 2007 - 08 this fair had settled 398 foreign tourists in the tourist village built after RTDC whereas this year this number was less than 217 people .
In the midst of all this there is no dearth of attracting tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . city train .
This train is continuously benefitting .
Last year by this train the benefit of RTDC was of nine and a half crore rupees .
Due to this deficiency in the tourist area of Rajasthan it has become natural to see the loss in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the most base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of man then he can make gold from soil .

The vision remains on the red color situated in the east .
There is a desire to sit on the bench situated in Balkani .

Thousands of miles away from our country , coming to this small village in the middle of these mountains covered with snow of Switzerland this is the first experience in the life of night .
This is my third foreign dwelling place in Swiss .
Before this we spent a long time in water or around it .
Located on both the sides of the thin Balkhati river most of the people are spread to a great extent on light rocks .
This is the main river of Switzerland Ron Valley on both sides of which there are many small and big cities .
The national highway and vehicles moving on it are clearly visible in parallel to the Ron river .

This 100 kms long and 10 kms wide waterfall is in the west of Geneva city .
From there the waterfall again turns into river and flows towards the west .
On the right side flowing shining waterfall , touching the sky are the peaks of Alps mountain .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left this highway on the left side , we came to the mountain path on the north side .
Because of being southward of the mountainous plains the sun is giving sun to all the corners on the third day .
In comparison to the valleys the ice climate can not be said to be less here .
As the height goes towards the height , the snow is increasing rapidly .
While on both the sides of the road there is a lot of snow covered , there is no coolness in the air because of the environment calm and bright sun .
We reached a small village named Thal on a journey of approximately 20 k . . on the mountainous road of this tremor .
There are large storeyed buildings made of wood with roofs of rocks and slopes .
In this three storey building along with standing cars in the foundation made of cement contract are part of controlling the required facilities like electricity , water , laundry .

There is a very big museum of grapes in a room made in the 12th century in a small business named Age to see which foreign tourists have to book agrime .
Once again we went through that jungle with Dawagni .
The mind became even more unhappy with the questions asked by the children for three-four kms .
Suddenly due to a sight of a turban a dramatic and charming change comes .
Right straight , on the left side of the road on a very deep valley a beautiful group of houses is established .
People are skiing in the snow in the plains beside the village .
On the skiing slope till the peak of Konda the dense forest of gods is spread .
There is a dense snow on all four sides .
The sun rays are shining on the houses .
In five minutes we reached that village .
Here also the same peace is spread .
All around from the peaks to the valleys the bright snow empire is the empire .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round wheel situated in the middle of that business .

It is said in Darjeeling that only the taxis of Sikkim go so that there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the place is another , but the same mountain , the trees and plants , the wind of sounding .
It vibrates the whole body .
This is the blue light rising in the rainy season .
As soon as the plan of the journey of Darjeeling was decided the first of all to take carsing camps .
Karsang is a small city in Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , is full of Dhupi jungles .
Good tea is famous for production .
On going towards Darjeeling from Siliguri the tea gardens start looking for smiles and welcome the people coming towards them .
Going on the road from the middle of tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side a dense slope .
Here once the jungle was seen tea gardens .
There was a green empire all around .
Once I am sorry to see these natural jungles or see the tea gardens laid by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The more beautiful , the more beautiful is the tea gardens spread .
The creation looks marvellous on the roads .
We kept on passing through the narrowness of the serpents and on the way .
Time is also going on .
Forests and tea gardens do not end at all .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
From a distance on a hill houses etc . were seen very crowded .
This is Karsiang .
Staying at one place here we made a plan to roam around a day .
Therefore taking a vehicle we left for the journey of Karsang .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
Go up i . . to reach Deer Park the vehicle had to be left very low .
The beauty of Karsiang is spread upwards , yet it has not been developed as a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and very peaceful .
Though the road was clear , to reach the deer park filled with jungles the joy of climbing the road between the charming and pine trees was boldening us .
Another place is Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called Suicide Point .
It is said that in the British period lovers used to take life from here .
However , there is a park and restaurant here .
There is a Siddhuma dome here on seeing it from a height a beautiful view of estimating the whole city is seen .
In the tea gardens nearby women are engaged in sneezing tea leaves playing hands very fast tied on the back .
There is an exhibition outside the city of Kasiang , but on that day we could not go there because it seemed very important to roam the beautiful environment of tea garden .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but it was very troubled by this , so how can we roam while raining .
But on reaching till the Rock Garden the weather is very good we roamed around while enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more entertaining than this .
The Ganges flowing through some mountains going down a little from here was visible .
The magnificence of waterfalls amidst rocks here is spectacular .
We saw in the Rock Garden that the waterfalls in the rocky empire are decorated with stones in the world .
These two places are present in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
Going up with the help of vehicle we saw the smoke in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope all the mountains and cities of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The quantity of environment was very clear till now .
When we moved towards Monastery , where the group of clouds came from , do not know and clouds are blooming .
In the evening there is a plan of shopping staying on the Mall Road .
In the journey of Darjeeling the journey of the train shines like a bright moon .
From Darjeeling to Gume and from Dhoom to Darjeeling the journey of train is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in the Mirik waterfall here and a small break in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this way , where in Nepali industry sweater etc . are available .
There is also facility of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its shape is different .
Here tea gardens are not only greenery but also the sounds of jungles and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist places of Kalimpong are Lava and Lolegaon , which are full of jungles and waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Calcutta to tour Darjeeling in the winter season , but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling have tied up their faces .
My situation was a small journey very joyful and thrilling .
This journey is not from abroad but from Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism in itself is a favorite thing in which sometimes the journey attracts towards itself , sometimes some important place , water ships or any city like train or a city full of pink or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some major attraction people come towards themselves .
The place about which I am talking was made just four and a half years ago , but with which construction this place came there he really praised the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears our guide Rambab was reciting my words , Oh , before this we did not even think that we could be like this in the jungle .
This place is fifty percent subsidiary .
Suddenly I felt that so many locals did not even get work in heritage hotels .
Ramba , a resident of Ajabgarh , was earlier working in Jaipur and today this great Shahi Suraj Waley was in Amman garden .
He himself hangs his words and deeds in a new way .
Ah , the estimation of Aman Bagh .
There nobody will engage you with English language .
Amman Bagh is actually a peaceful and all comfortable tourist spot .
This garden also has a history in itself and the most important thing is that it will also introduce you to the nearby areas .
How many people spent holidays in the emperor 's houses of Rajasthan have traveled in Bhangarh , why should you go far , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek may have lived the night in this very place .
After the construction of Aman Bagh big and big people of the country and abroad came here .
I also remember that night when Shabana Azmi called me there completely but I could not go .
This thing had reached Bhangarh after leaving her own way .
This time suddenly I reached there on the invitation of our foreign brethren but it seemed that those people who want to spend their holidays properly in less time they definitely wanted to go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden in those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to make camps for hunting .
Its construction was done in fifteen hundred twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
In the shadow of mountains full of and fragrant trees the first glimpse of Amman Bagh hypnotises you .
As you come inside you will be welcomed by which you will feel that you have to pay attention to great peace here .
Together with the construction of the palace of Manikaran the life of the Arti mantras is lost .
We reached there in the evening and we began to put a surrounding in that garden .
We were decorating the joke given our hospitality , immediately gave me peace that it was very interesting to me .
All buildings and forts are inspired .
The best is their lighting .
Yes , on all new things , artistic , there is no wonder that Amman Bagh has also got a gift today .
Manese had determined our programs in the morning .
First of all roaming on foot with Ramba and then a jeep journey in Bhangarh .
While walking on a small road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the sun rays were spread gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the rails are doing farming .
This year we did not rain but for the first time we saw tobacco fruit .
This glitter of rural life is a unique experience of zeki Kosam ' .
After that we reached Bhanugarh through jeep .
In the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in a deep meditation .
This is an invaluable fruit for millions of dollars .
The same method of the habit of Aman Bagh is also genetic , by feeding jaggery and curd we got rid of it .
Then it was understood why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard that in order to show the train life also tour packages are also put .
Is this true
There is no doubt and this happens in many states and tourists also show more interest on it .
This tour is generally decided for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating , etc .
This way an attempt is being made to explore such a place where there was not much development and there was no major effect on time on the level of nature and life of people .
At the same time there are ancient tourist sites etc . also there .
Besides this , it is also paid attention to the survey of Traditional Kuzine .
Actually , the tourists with regard to such journeys have to show straight the methods and traditions of dressing at that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such a tour is really very interesting and another experience is felt .
The journey of sufficient journey is pleasant for us .
You can enjoy roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book free for a long time .
Yes , here it is so important that we have heard that with spending and with a long time we are oblivious to stay in this journey .
This is the reason that to enjoy these some things must be remembered , especially when some foreigner is watching with you through a tour of destinations .
Find a good middleman before taking a ticket .
Students , officers of the army , children etc . get stones in them , both are also available for stones .
Although it is less than taking tickets before hence it is better to put bus tour plan for the last minute before planning .
Instead of tour ticket know about the whole tour rate .
It is cheap .
There are also some suggestions for the material , therefore one should also know about the quantity and weight of the material .
If this happens somewhere then you have to leave some things in terminals or pay more money .
Together with this also know the information of insurance or harmfulness in tour company .
Take the calorie on bags alright .
Because they get fit in the rock situated on the seat .
Keep in mind this also that during the journey while changing the bus yourself will be the obligation of the goods .
From where to go by bus reach there , one hour before time .
During the rivalry you should keep special attention on this matter .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the chances of getting a good seat will also be with you .
While choosing the seat also keep an eye on your convenience .
There are many scratches in the back seat , but it is not suitable to read in front of the seats .
If you have to go to urinate again and again then take the last seat and do not like much difference then the seat near the window will be good for you .
Now is an active thing .
If you are in the seat keeping hands on both sides then sit on the last seat before and keep your bag on it .
If there are not much people in the bus then planning can be successful .
If there is facility of washing in the bus then keep in mind this thing as well while choosing the seat because after some time it is difficult to sit there .
Introduce the driver of the bus and the conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
Everybody is asked to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not keep your luggage on the seat so that the buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stops come back on time .
If you do not come on time , then you can get your place for a new tourist and you have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

In the Emvi Equamorine of Lui Cruise ship you can go to Maldives for a trip of about 5850 rupees per person for three days every night .
That is , the fare for one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
But if there are two elders then in the age of 15 years the child is completely free .
Otherwise .
Tea tips , meals all are available on the fare of cruise .
Every moment is with the time of time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the treasures , activities available in Maldives according to the number of your pockets - from seaplane ride to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes you will feel like a sportsperson suddenly coming in front of you .
But this 12 - 15 stairs of television is best for roaming in Oterplane like Maldives in all ways .
It is not known when it flys in the air while running like a speed boat on the water .
When you fly completely you will not feel like flying ordinary flights .
Every moment your sight will be seen below the window , in the blue colored water in the variety of sites of the Maldives the resort islands and Koral islands are covered with shining .
Everything looks good .
There are two seaplane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of them , near which are twenty seplines .
If you want you can roam around around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- in an airways or you can take a fare for spending a day in the entire syphilis .
Although if you go from the island to another island then the journey of sea plane is necessary because this is the way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which your mind will never feel like finishing .
The journey of sepline from 12 kms to 183 kms is done in Maldives .
We were in the biggest Antique and Sovenire shops of the capital of Ahmad Bazar of Male .
One day before by the President of Maldives , Mahmoud Nashid of Salesmanta , he is listening very carefully to the conversation given in the World Environmental Conference in Copenhagen .
In reality I have not seen any Indian listening so carefully to the conversations of the princes or prime ministers .
But when there is a question of the conditions of a new creation on this earth , it is so impossible for seriousness .
Many people consider it unemployed in the convention that happened in the water through coconut in Maldives in October but if they go to Maldives then it seems that if the nature 's specimens are locked from us then the world will descend into a very unconscious situation .
There are some such importance in the beauty there .
As if the beauty of that small country has remained incomplete .
When we returned towards the jetty to go back to their cruise from that market tour , when our eyes go towards the water of the sea while moving towards the road then it feels that the people here can understand the price of these beauty at what level .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming in several metres deep below the lappost light are seen with all its colors .
This is a part of the sea which is completely separated from the city .
If you can see the water of sea or river from any city of India completely then you will be very fortunate .
The evening spent in Male while returning to Emvi Ekyamerine was roaming in the jungle for two hours .
Coral reef is the life here .
As far as possible you will also get to see stones of marble on the tombs .
A few moments before the conversation of President Nashid we were standing outside his government residence .
There is no belief that we were ahead of the highest testimony building of the other country , nobody would be safe for some time .
A lot of joy we took photographs of Vasara and gardens located at a distance of about fifty kilometres by entering through the door of their building .
Can you think of any political house in India like this
It is also known here that sometimes the president goes to his office before two blankets crossing the road on foot .
Everything about Maldives is amazing .
That is why I was waiting for the next day .
Devawani meaning that day some major incident will take place .
In the morning a ship from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached Maldives while roaming around in Ranve .
Before evening when cruise reached near Male we immediately remembered the sepline going on top .
The number of photographs you have seen are of them .
But then we could not lose the next day there was a chance to travel there .
We had to go to Rangali Island of 150 kms through the sepline of Trace Maldives .
It is unforgettable to see thousands of trees spread in the sea of Maldives from the sea plane flying up to a height of approximately thousand kms and seeing Koral Island .
This beauty of water is not visible anywhere else .
It is the courage to fly on holding the breath with thrill and excitement .
But on reaching Konarad Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , there is no relation with any country outside it .
Wasta is also not such that it is difficult to get such beauty or glimpse out .
Walking on Konark can also be done on foot or by battery running vehicles .
The views of the lifestyle of the tribes on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to Main Island are marvellous .
Now we are unable to believe us naturally in the nature around , we reached such a place which is unimaginable .
With the help of stairs we reached the room with glass while entering the sea water several metres below which was inside the water .
This room is normally a dining room .
On all sides of the glass we can see all kinds of small and big fishes , corals , snocraling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated chairs was very thrilling in us .
On coming to this island from Male the fare of seeing it and underwater chain is Rs . 47 thousand per person .
I did not feel like returning from there .
We all were also ready to spread our passports in water .
But know , this is not so easy .
We went back with this belief that if there is any chance then fortunately takes it here .
I have been planning to go out of Delhi for many days but the work is not possible to go anywhere due to stress .
Wildlife was fond from childhood but I thought that why did not this sufficient gym cobra go .
This is the second bicycle after biking till Pegog Lake situated before Khardugla in Ladakh in 2006 .
In the month of 27 December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the excitement that came out of smoothness had displayed our speed .
In the journey between Hafoot to Gajrola we were really stuck .
Smoke from above and no good roads in front .
Several times we felt that we had become more .
Somehow we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Right we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres away from Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near the park , whose booking was done beforehand .
On that day there was a major program that we went to tour the coast of Kosi before being cold .
After spending two-three hours there we went out to the Carbot Museum , with great distress the Dhangdi Gate located at a distance of 2 kms .
From there we went to tour Ramnagar situated below .
It was just evening to return .
On deciding from Delhi I would definitely see the lion roaming around in the jungle , I was seeing a lion all night .
In the middle of the deep sleep at night suddenly I heard a very big sound and after that the dog did not stop for two hours .
Just before it was decided to roam Kaladungi and Carbot Fall .
Kaladungi is thirty kilometres away , only then came on the carbot Fall way .
Kaladungi Jim Corbot Saheb Museum , where some important things related to their real life have been kept .
On coming back it was twelve and a half .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbot had come to this village .
The journey to reach the resort is waiting for us .
It was told that they had provided the facility of sighting in a Saint Bijrani there in November .
When asked about one of the numbers then it was said that there is a lot of grassland and Tiger comes towards that side to save from winters .
As soon as Bijrani reached , he gave us a guide , who takes two hundred and fifty to travel for four hours .
We went out to go inside the jungle .
We saw many types of animals and deer of several species there .
Inside we saw two tosser elephants , which had big teeth .
I took photographs bravely .
In the middle of this the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide said that the tigers around 150 in the park , some of them have died now .
At some places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tigers .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind the tiger had encompassed the earth .
That is why I remembered one of my older sons of Haldani .
I made him a phone of Sardake .
I told him that I came to Carbot .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
These words of him make me a well .
I said slowly , not .
There is no permission to take a bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride inside .
