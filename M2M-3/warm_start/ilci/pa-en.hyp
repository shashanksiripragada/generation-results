Their language is different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch and on the other side Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in language .
It is called  kuchi ' .
Although this is ' Boli ' , its own script is not there .
If you have to write the knife then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has come many times and all the cities have been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The story of Jaisalmer - Toral is very interesting .
If we return from the path from which we had come then we will have to take a whole month ' s holiday and there will be schools open in Mumbai .
So what do you do  Now you will travel in the train by calling fast buses of Gujarat .
The small train of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there a small train towards meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train of broad gauge from Ahmedabad will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan 's economy is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the increasing threat of trade slowdown and terrorism in South Asia the tourism business has reached a deep stretch .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan who are being killed in the major states of the country has been declining cough during these days .
The figures released by the Rajasthan government recently show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased by more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . percent in the number of native tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
A total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in 2008 out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countrymen and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 only two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Of these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 indigenous and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with the tourism sector are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Mexican gradually says that global slowness and terrorist incidents have badly affected tourism trade .
We have not been able to develop a strong infrastructure of tourism here in comparison to other countries of Asia .
This is the reason that even in the number of foreign tourists coming to India there has been a decrease of 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Of the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The recent years have passed the best for Rajasthan with the help of tourism .
After 2008 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has decreased .
From the point of view of tourism a new thing is happening .
Desert , palaces , forts , ponds , forests everything is such ancient that to enjoy tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments talk of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
Along with foreign palaces , in recent years in Rajasthan the incidents of blasphemy and chaos have also made the shadow of this state at international level .
Years before the Rajasthan government had given tourism the state the status of encouraging but it has remained limited to only papers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the achievement of Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of inviting tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed the RTDC in 1979 .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , movement , boating etc to the tourists .
There are total 75 units of this corporation .
Out of which 39 hotels , 22 motor , eight cafeteria , three travellers , one traffic unit and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the condition of this corporation has also remained thin for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008-09 was 185 lakhs which is estimated to be 632 lakhs in the year 2009-10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels could not be filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big deficit .
Among these the main is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists could not become attractive towards this rail .
Despite reducing fare it could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a decrease in the interest of tourists towards the Pushkar fair .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by RTDC in this fair this number remained less than 217 .
Among all this the satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards Palace on Wheels i . . royal train .
This rail is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC had the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this fall coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism area .
Tourism is the biggest base of Rajasthan 's economy .
If there is a desire to do something in the heart of a person then he can make gold from soil .
Subrata Roy has shown it true by setting up modern city Embo Valley in the mountain ranges of Sahadri of Maharashtra .
The suppression that he had seen glimpses in his eyes while proceeding day by day .
His pleasure was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has become successful in making its place as a good city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been built on only 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many entrepreneurs come forward to build their houses in this city built for only millionaires and today around families are living in this city .
First of all industrialists and residents bought their homes here in the form of Hollyday Home but now they have made it their first house and they travel to Mumbai for work from here .
Behind Ambe Valley is Korigarh Fort which gives beauty to this area .
The ruins of Likawali in western Siyang district are very important .
The remains of a large temple are found in the excavation .
On the pillars of the stones of this temple the excavation of the idols of Kamal and the gods and goddesses has been done quite which is mostly in a broken state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very region .
On this place a Dussehra statue of Devi Durga is found .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devpali are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in these ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the glory of Tamareshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings in the north - eastern hills this goddess was recognised far and wide .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .
There was sacrifice of humans here which was later stopped by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak city which is situated in the middle of the Dibang and Diang rivers here .
According to the stories prevalent here this place is ancient Vidharbha , where at one time king Bhishmak used to rule .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
Tribes like Degru , Mishami etc . guide the tourists here .
These people themselves also have great faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far-off places come here .
Besides the above ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also of very historical importance .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roing are still telling their story .
The deficiency of bathing , getting surrounded by pucca stairs and pucca ponds all around and getting relics of wide and wide roads are still singing the peace of their ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam through jeep for four hours .
This place is the main center of Lor Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is the charming place where there are hunters .
It takes several days to reach here before the road of jeep .
On reaching here the views of high deodar trees , beautiful premrose , volleytes , wild carnet , strawberries and raceberries enjoy the visitors .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the hustle-bustle people .
With its untiring hard work the hunters have made it their heaven .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plain is a living example of their hard work and the skill of agriculture .
The need for their irrigation is fulfilled from the Kali river .
The trees of pine enhance the beauty of this valley .
Looks like a light redness emerging in the sky on white in the middle of the ranges laden with snow of the left hand .
Good cough is cold in the air .
Along with the coolness swinging in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of waste below the legs one gets to see on the layer of the turban spread on the floor of wood .
There is narrowness in the environment and because of the blindness before sunrise being shadow there is not much visible .
Eyes remain pills on redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the bunch lying in the balcony .
On putting hands the smooth layer of the eyelid gets chewed with the sound of a light kitchen and the hand gets separated from sneezing with a feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience of spending the night in this small village settled in the middle of these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third stay in Swiss .
Before this most of the time spent geneba or around it .
The dense population settled in the valley on both the sides of the thin balcony river is spread up to very high on the slopes .
This is the valley of the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The highways and cars shouting on it have begun to give clearness in parallel to the Ron river .
300 kms away and half an hour journey from the car is halfway then along with the equivalent of the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction near the city named Montro which is called the Geneva lake -LRB- Lak Lams -RRB- is found in the middle .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide Geneva city is settled on the western end of this lake .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side on the side of the lake are the mountain ranges of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
Crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we leave this highway from the left side and come on the hilly path towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being south - eastern the sun of climbing is giving full sunshine to all the eyes .
The quantity of snow as compared to the valley is less here - almost not equal .
As soon as we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite good coughing snow being frozen on both the sides of the road there is no special coolness in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
On this circular hilly road after completing a journey of about 20 kms in half an hour we reach a small village named Thal .
There are shallow slopy roofed , completely large multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood .
In the basement made from the cement concrete of this three storey bungalow there are rooms to control essential services like electricity , water , ladder along with parking of trains .
Switzerland is famous for the cultivation of grapes .
This wine is the main center of making wine wine wine .
There is cultivation of grapes on 37  of the entire cantonment .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley grapes give a marvellous dimension to the beauty there .
To take the gardens of grapes to the ground , to roam them in the villages there and to take them to the factory of wine wine and to taste alcohol is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of grapes in a watch made in the 12th century in a small town named Aghe , to see which foreign tourists have to do a grim booking .
Once again we pass through the same jungle from Dawanal .
Till three-four kms the mind becomes even more filled with the chillies of the children throughout the road .
Suddenly on a turn a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Right in front , on the slope of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
On sloping from above the village people are skiing in the snow .
On the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope the dense jungle of Mak deodar is spread .
There is a dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
Here also there is silence .
From the peak of the mountain to the valley all around the empire of Dhaval Hima .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big round cycle in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Luckerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Luckerabad is about 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and healthy people coming here can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels for staying in Chaula 1500 , camping site of tents , health center of 90 beds and 50 restaurants .
65 sleeps of hot water have been found in Lukarabad till now .
The 40 lac litres coming out of these everyday till 510 hot water in the entire town of water is transported to around 30 thermal pools made at places , some pools are inside five star hotels and according to the pockets of the people of different groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of hotness .
In open sunshine on the roof of houses the thick layer of snow is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the safest places in the form of a heritage of national importance in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling that Sikkim can only be taxis therefore there is no checking .
The journey is going on , the region is second , but mountains are there , trees and plants are there , all the air is there .
There is fresh moisture on the whole body .
In the season of rains sweet light is the same .
The plan of Darjeeling journey is fixed . First of all the decision of the sight of Karsiyang was taken .
Karsyang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dry forests .
Famous for excellent tea production .
If we move towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , then initially tea gardens welcome those who move towards themselves spreading smiles .
In the middle of tea gardens less than a road hypnotise the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side is Hari Khai .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was an empire of everybody around .
Once I got scared , see these natural jungles or tea plants planted by humans .
Both were drawing towards themselves .
The beautiful jungles were as beautiful as tea gardens spread far and wide .
If you look at the road then it seems very marvellous .
The way of snakes was passing through twisted and barren paths .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing then jungles and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance itself a hilly house was seen very dense from houses etc .
This was Karsyong .
Staying at one place here we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is why after taking a vehicle we went out on a tour of Karsyong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the ascending up i . . deer park the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being rich with the beauty of Karsyong it has not been developed in the form of a tourist spot .
However , the city is very good and clean .
Despite being deserted the way the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the way between the dust trees was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is also called suicide point .
It is said that in the era of the British lovers used to give life by slaughtering here .
At present , this is a park and with restaurants .
There is a stair-like dome here at a height of which a beautiful view is present on visiting the whole city .
In tea gardens around women were busy breaking the tea leaves running hands with extremely fast speed on the back .
There is a museum outside the city of Karsyong , but on that day we could not go there because touring the environment of tea gardens was more important .
The next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in itself , but there was great concern from this that if there was rain then how would we roam around .
But it was very good that after reaching the Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than this .
On moving a little further below from here we got Gangamaya surrounded by hills .
Here the shadow of waterfalls amidst the rocks is spectacular .
In the Rock Garden we found that waterfalls in the empire of rocks are charming here then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Ganga Maya is decorated with stones .
These two places are very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
Arising on the basis of the vehicle we saw a loop in Darjeeling .
With the help of telescope the entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The mood of the weather was still clean .
But as soon as we moved towards the monastery , decreasing where we appeared and started shining .
In the evening there was a plan of walking and shopping on Malrod .
In the tour of Darjeeling tower trains enhance the journey .
From Darjeeling to Dhoom and from Dhoom to Darjeeling the journey of tower train is special attraction for tourists .
Here boating in the Mirik lake and a little thrill in the garden .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route , where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district , but its form - color is different .
Here there is no greenery of tea gardens but the movement of forests and waterfalls .
There is the most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong besides Lolegaon , which is full of jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling tied me with them .
My recent little journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign or outside Rajasthan but was very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , water ship or any royal train or any city like a rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of this one special attraction people come to pull .
The place where I am going to talk is just prepared about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has come there it has actually turned into a jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for those living there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena echo , Saheb could not even think before that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff belongs to this area .
Suddenly I felt that these local people did not get work in the heritage hotel as well .
Ram Babu resident of Ajbgarh used to work in Jaipur first and now in this unique royal style Amn Bagh .
He has sloped his speech in a new color .
Saheb ' is the estimation of Amn Bagh .
There nobody calls you in English language .
Amman Bagh is actually a tourist spot with peaceful and all comfortable facilities .
The garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it also makes your acquaintance with the surrounding areas .
How many people spent holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan would have toured Bhangarh of the past , why do you go far , even among the people of Jaipur , Kuchek may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Amn Bagh big people from all over the country reach there .
I also remember that night when Shabana Ajmi had called me there from Tehdil but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he had reached Bhangarh by wandering on his way .
This time suddenly I reached there on the pleasure of my foreign guest , then felt that those people who want to spend a grand holiday in less time , they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to stay for hunting .
Its construction was done in one and a half to twenty .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
The first glimpse of the Amman Bagh surrounded by hills and in the shadow of dense trees hypnotise you .
As soon as you come inside , the way you are welcomed , it seems from that that the attention has been given here on the divine peace .
Along with binding Mauli in Kalai the mantra of Mangalacharan is enlightened alive .
We had reached the slope in the evening we intended to put a cycle of that garden .
Like my messenger , who has been devoted , suddenly spoken , ' This is interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
That is , artistic on everything has not been surprised that Amman Bagh has also got the award recently .
Manesar decided our program for the morning .
First of all roaming on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on a road like a road we saw the fort of Ajbgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw a dry lake in which farmers were doing agriculture .
This year when there was no rain then for the first time we saw the agriculture of tobacco .
If for this then such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhawangarh from jeep .
In the morning I had seen a traveller of Haland sitting in deep concentration .
This is an unmatched moment of million dollars .
The way to say goodbye to Amn Bagh was also traditional by feeding jaggery and curd they left us .
Now it was understood why tourists come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept for showing traffic life .
Is this right
Of course this happens in many other states and tourists also show cough interest in them .
This tour is generally prepared for the time of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes staying there , eating etc .
This way an attempt is made to explore such places where there has not been much development and where there has not been special effect of time on the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time where old tourist sites etc . are also present .
Besides this , attention is also paid on doing tridental cooking .
Actually , the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists aware of the ways and traditions of living in that place .
Although it feels a little difficult in thinking , but such tours are really interesting and give a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own enjoyment .
Despite being with a lot of people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give your favorite book a lot of time without distributing .
Yes , it is important that along with giving a lot of time less expensive and peaceful , this tour definitely keeps the demand of Sabar from you .
This is the reason that to enjoy these it is important to keep in mind some things , especially when you are watching any foreign destination through bus tour .
Find the best deal before taking ticket .
Students , senior people of Military , children etc . get discount on them , then there is also a discount arrangement for two people .
Although shopping of tickets in advance is cheap , therefore in the last moments it is better to make a bus tour plan a little earlier .
Instead of tour ticket know about round trips .
This is cheap .
Regulations regarding bags are very hard , therefore ask about the size and weight of the goods .
There is no such thing that you have to leave yourself on some normal terminal or you have to fill extra percent .
Together with this go to the rules of insurance or loss compensation with tour company .
Carry on bags remain right , but go .
Because they get fit in the reckoning on the seat .
Also keep in mind that while doing bus changes during tour you will have the responsibility of yourself .
Wherever you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the business season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , the better seat operation will be with you .
Keep in mind the conference while choosing the seat .
If you will feel more fractured on the previous seat , then reading on the posts ahead is not conformable .
If you have to go to Lu again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more depressed then the window seat will be better for you .
Now there is a talk of walking .
If you are in the backbone of both the armies then sit on the corner seat first and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then planning will remain .
If there is facility of vasrum in the bus , then keep in mind this thing while visiting the seat , because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is asked to go out .
During this do not leave yourself at the seat because on its disappearance buses do not take responsibility for it .
Wherever the bus stayed , come back at the time .
If you do not come on time then you can get a new tourist in your place and you have to wait for another bus on the terminal .

In today 's date the fare for Maldives is 28 thousand rupees back from Delhi to the cheapest person .
After that if you stay in Male then even then hotels can be found in a little rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then pocket will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Lui Cruise from Kochi started India 's only cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Lui cruise is a European company and is quite famous in cruise and hotel business .
Though due to some problems Lui Cruise has adjoined its services now , but from October they are expected to be restored .
You can go to Maldives for a three day cruise at the rate of at least 5850 rupees per person on the ship of Lui Cruise Equamirin .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
If there are two elders then children below the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else should be needed .
The rent of cruise includes tea - breakfast , food .
Enjoyed the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Male you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives according to your pocket - from C . Plain Road to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a cyclone stands in front of you then you will feel like a toy .
But this hill with 12 - 15 seats is uninterruptedly excellent for tour of Orchipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Oter Plain Maldives .
While running like a speed boat on the surface of water it ever gets up in the air , do not know .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of normal airplanes .
Every time your eyes keep watching the lower islands while watching the resort islands and coral islands in the blue water of different Sheds of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are only two C . Plain companies in Maldives .
Translated Maldives is one of them with which there are twenty plains .
If you want you can tour air for an hour in approximately thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- or the whole sea plane can be rented for your whole day .
Although if you go to any island beyond Male Island then the journey of the Sea Plain will be necessary because this is a journey between different islands .
And that is such a journey which may not be your mind to end .
The sea plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in the east -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the biggest antique and golden shop of the capital in the Ahmedabad market of Male .
All Salesmans were listening to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nashid a day before in the World Climate Summit in Copenhagen .
If you say honestly then no Indian has seen the speeches of the President or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of an unprecedented creation of this earth , such seriousness was inevitable .
Many people may have considered the meeting made inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but after going to Maldives it seems that if the anger of nature loses it with us then the world will become so far .
Something in the beauty of there is such a special .
In that small country as if it does not bring so much beauty .
Returning towards the jetty to go back to his cruise from that tour of the market , when the sight went in the water of the sea along with Burbas circuit then it felt how much the people here understand the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that the fish floating under the light of lamppost several metres deep were clearly visible with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can also see some centimetres in the sea or water of the river connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself dry .
While returning to MV Aquamirin two hours of the evening spent in Male were roaming in the brain .
Coral reef -LRB- coral rocks -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones on the tombs you will get to see the rocks of coral .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his official residence .
It was not sure that we were ahead of the residence of the best person of any country , there was no security worker far and wide .
With fun we were drawing pictures of gardens and surroundings just fifty metres away by increasing our hand inside the door of his bungalow .
That you can think about the house of such a leader in India .
It also came to know that sometimes the president reaches his office on foot only while crossing the road .
Everything about Maldives was surprising .
That is why I was waiting for the next day 's vessel .
It seems that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a boat from Cruise brought us to Airport Island .
From there we reached the base of Trans Maldives by cutting the rock of the runway .
Last evening when the cruise was reaching near Mall then we were walking from above and immediately recognized the plane .
Those pictures which were seen , of them .
But then it was not known that the next day it would get the opportunity to ride .
We were going to go to Rangali island a hundred and five kilometres away from the C Plain of Trans Maldives .
It was amazing to see hundreds of resorts and coral islands spread in the sea of Maldives from the Plains flying till a height of approximately thousand metres .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
He was the flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Kornad Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no residents from any outside world .
The dweller was not even such that it was difficult to get out like beauty or Vilasta .
Tour on Kornad can also be done on foot or by battery run train .
While going from Jetty to the main island the view of water life on both the sides of the bridge was amazing .
Now we had not been able to make ourselves comfortable with the nature around , that we reached such a place , it was black .
While descending into the water of the sea several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
That room was actually a dining room .
On all sides crossing the glasses we could see innumerable types of small and big fishes , corals , snowcling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables was very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to Sea Plain the fare of seeing it and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for a person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to give shelter in our passport water .
But we knew , this was not possible .
Returned with this hope with heavy mind that sometimes , sometimes , sometimes the fate will definitely be brought to the fore .
It was planning to go out of Delhi for many days but due to the arrangement of evening this was not possible .
From childhood the wildlife was adventurous then imagine why not go to Jim Corbett this time .
In 2006 this was the second bike tour after biking till Pagong lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh .
On the morning of 27 December we returned to Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the zeal that came out from Kore turned our weekend back .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
From above Kora and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now we fell .
Somehow we reached Gajraula at eight o'clock in the morning .
Well we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dikuli near the park , whose booking we had already done .
On that day there was no special program but despite being cold we first went to tour the coast of Kosi .
After spending two-three hours there the Corbett Museum went out , which was near Dhangadi gate two kilometres away .
From there we went to visit Ramnagar below .
It was quite evening while returning .
It was clear from Delhi that if I saw lions roaming freely in the jungle then I kept looking at lions all night .
In the midst of the depths of the night suddenly heard me a strong thunderstorm and after that the dogs who started roaming then they were not silent for two hours .
Therefore there was a suggestion of touring Kaladungi and Corbett Falls first .
Kaladungi is 30 kms away whereas Corbett Fall falls on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Sahib in Kaladungi where some special things related to his personal life have been kept .
On turning around we got twelve o'clock .
Kaladungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the journey Jeepsy was waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged for sighting in the number one site business there .
On asking about number one it was said that there is more grassland and tigers come towards that side to escape from cold during this period .
As soon as we reached Bijnani we were given a guide , which takes two and a half hundred rupees to travel for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two twisted elephants , whose long teeth were .
I roamed and photographed .
In the middle the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are tigers around 150 in the park , out of which some have died recently .
In many places we also saw the marks of their claws , but I was sad by not getting the view of the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my mind there was a tiger 's furnace rider .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I called him the same way .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked if he saw the tiger or not .
These words of him were kissed as soon as possible .
There was no permission to take bike in the park .
Someone advised us to take a ride inside .
During the journey it was found that due to the busy highway near the park often animals get wounded or die by crawling with vehicles .
