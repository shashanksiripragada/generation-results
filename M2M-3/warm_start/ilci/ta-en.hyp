First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by jungles all around .
The train is very low to reach from above .

Although the city is quite good and clean .
From the road without being surrounded by jungles , reaching till the Deer Park and going in the middle of the trees in the sun gives us a feeling of joy .

The resident of Ajabgarh Rambabu had earlier worked in Jaipur and now this unique amazing ambience is in Amman garden .
He gave a new shape while talking to himself .
Sahiba is the honor of Aman Garden .
There nobody calls you in English .
Aman Garden is actually a peaceful place and a tourist spot with all the best facilities .
This garden is its history and the best thing is that it introduces its nearby areas .
For spending holidays in the best statistics of Rajasthan how many people roam around the bugyals of Bhutan , why do they go far , some of the Jaipuris may have spent nights in this area .
After the opening of Aman Garden most of the people of the country and abroad come there .
I remember that night when Sapna Ashmi called me with interest but I could not go .
If they reached Bangadh by finding their own way then this is a different kind .
This time suddenly with the call of my foreign guests I felt there that these people want to spend a good holiday in less time therefore you must go to Aman Garden .
This garden is a separate garden protected in those seven gardens where Alwar king had gone to hunting .
Its construction was done in 19 - 20th century .
Its ancient wall is a testimony of those days .
In the shadow of the dense and dense trees surrounded by mountains Aman Garden charms itself in the first part .
The way you come in the same way you are welcomed , so it is said that you can feel the very peaceful environment here .

On seeing the dry lake the peasants used to crop in it .
This year on not rainy season we saw the field of tobacco for the first time .
The village life of Jok was such a unique experience .
After that we reached Bangkok by jeep .
In the morning I saw Halandu sitting very carefully in a tourist place .
These are invaluable moments of millions of dollars .
From Aman Garden also the tradition of Alvida was traditional , giving us jaggery and curd gave us information .
Tourists can now know why they come here by spending so much .
I am told that a tourist group is set up to show the life of the tribals .
Is it right
Certainly this is found in some states and tourism shows special interest in it .
This tourism is generally organised for 4 days to 2 weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
In this how to eat stay there .
In such an explanation attempt is made where there is no maximum development and there there is no contribution in the lifestyle of nature and people .
At the same time there are ancient tourist species .
Besides this attention is also given to the survey of the Tridisonal Guge .
In reality such tourist lovers can be seen directly in the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although if you think it is a little difficult , but going to such a tourism gives interest and gives a different kind of experience .
Tourists can enjoy going on bus .
If you see a crowd here then you can enjoy roaming in a different way .
Not only this in this journey you can take too much time to read your favorite book .
Yes , along with spending less and peacefulness all the time this journey also makes us feel satisfied .
To celebrate this it is important to keep in mind some things at a very important time when you will be watching any foreign destination bus tourism .
Find the best tea before getting the ticket .
For stunts , military people , children etc . tickets are available here and arrangements are made for both people .
As such it is better to buy a preferred journey , therefore it is better to arrange tourism in the last train in the bus , then make arrangements before .
Instead of traveling , tell about round trips .
The cost of the morning is less .
It is very important to take things , therefore keep in mind the matter of fatness and weight .
You leave some of your things in terms or you fill the electric substances .
Along with this take the pleasure of insurance or loss from the tourist group .
Take care of yourself very comfortable .
Because it can be put on the rock on the seat .
This thing should be kept in mind that during tourism the responsibility of changing goods from bus is on its own .
Wherever you have a bus go to that time also an hour before .
If you want to keep this thing in the main duration of the pission .
In reality the sooner you go , the better seat system will be around you .
Keep in mind the convenience while choosing .
Take the back side too much but there is no convenience of reading in the front rooms .
If you have to urinate frequently then take a far-off seat , if you do not want to get much trouble then it is better for you to sit near the door .
Now there is a miraculous thing .
If you both sit in the seat of sitting then first sit in the coastal seat and keep your precaution on the other side .
That is why if there is not much crowd in the bus then your arrangement will be successful .
Therefore while examining the seat if there is facility of washroom in the bus then keep in mind this thing that it is difficult to sit there after some time .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get enough information .
Everybody is told to come out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not put yourself on the seat because if it goes away then people of bus do not take responsibility for it .
Go back to the time where the bus stands .
If you do not go on time then you can see a new tourist in your place and you have to wait for another bus .

Every time you are watching below the window , roam the islands and corps islands in the water below the different caves of Maldives .
Everything has two C . Blain companies .
There are two C . Blain companies in Maldives .
Transmittee is a good place in which there is a sea plane near it .
If you want you can roam around around 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- in an hour or complete blade is given to you on rent for travel throughout the day .
If you go to the island from Maldives then it is necessary to travel in C Blain because it is normal to travel between different islands .
And this is a journey by which if there is fear of danger then do not travel in it .
C . Blain travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres on Maldives .
We were in the most temporary and sovanier markets of the capital of Ahmad Bazar of Maldives .
All the selsmen have been listening to the words given by the President of Maldives Mohammad Nashid a day before in the Cave Halls in a world climate very carefully .
I am confident that no Indian has heard the words of President or Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a challenge in the base of an unparalleled army of this earth then it is such a terrible thing .
Some people know the magnificence of the people who reach inside the water through the captain of Maldives in October because how poor the world becomes when they snatched away from us the anger of nature .
Some of the beauty there are such important .
There is no such beautiful tomb in that small country .
On roaming around the market returns towards the jetty to go to their guruj , then surely on the road sighting the sea water is eaten because the people here know this beautiful magnificent border .
Fish swimming in some metres deep under the light of Lamp Pongt was showing with all its colors .
It was a sea part which was connected to the city .
If you are able to see some centimetres clean in the river or sea water connected to any city of India then you will get the pleasure of yourself .
On returning to M . . Academy the evening of spending roaming in Maldives is roaming in jewellery for two hours .
Goral ripe -LRB- buffalo -RRB- is the life here .

In order to listen to the words of President Nashi some governments were standing outside again .
We were ahead of the best president 's residence of a country without any security for a long time because we could not believe .
We were taking photographs on the garden and footpath at a distance of about 50 metres as soon as we left our hand inside his terrible gate .
Can you think like this by taking some ordinary head in India .
It is said that the President had always come to his office in front of two blocks while crossing the roads on foot .
Everything in the matter of Maldives is harmful .
That is why I was waiting for the next day to be unconscious .
That day had to be important as a good dress .
From Guruji in the morning a boat entered us till Airport Jaland .
From there we reached the place of Trans Maldives by roaming around the Ranway .
After that when Guruji was coming out of Maldives in the evening then we immediately recognized the C . Blair going out .
He was looking at such maps .
But then there was no doubt that the next day there was a chance to pay attention to it .
We had to go to Rangali Island 500 kilometres away from the C Blair of Trans Maldives .
Flying at a height of approximately 1000 metres from C Blain to the sea of Maldives hundreds of restaurants and call islands were unforgettable .
This beautiful water is not found anywhere .
This is a journey to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But as soon as we reached the Golden Resort of the Hillton Hotels in Rangai Island it seems as if we have come to another world .
In such a world , there was no contact with any other world outside .
It was difficult to get out of the beauty or smooth life there .
One can go on walking in Konark or one can go to the train running by battery .
While going from Jetty to Main Island on both the sides of the bridge the beauty of life was amazing .
Now we came to this place that we could not imagine that we could not be natural with the nearby nature .
On getting down at the sea level several metres through stairs we went inside a glass room which was inside the water .
That half was really a meal and was a room .
On all sides through glasses we can see marvellous types of fishes , golf , snocarling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating sitting on decorated tables keeps on thrilling in itself .
From Male to sea plane this island has come to see it and for drinking food under water the fare is 47 thousand rupees per person .
There is no feeling of returning from there .
We were ready to swallow our passport in water .
We know it's not possible.
We returned with the same confidence in our minds , then sometimes the privilege will definitely bring us back to a turn .
There was a plan to go to Wali from Delhi for a long time but because of being employed it did not happen .
Because of the desire of wild animals from the child , why should not Jim Corbett go this time
In Ladakh in 2006 it was another picnic after skiing till Yekong lake at some distance from Kardukala .
In the morning of 27th December we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the surge of the surgeon had reduced our speed .
The journey between Hapur to Kajraula was really tired .
Snow and bad roads in front of me .
Many times it appeared that when we are going to fall .
On one side we reached Karjrola at eight o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock properly .
Corbett National Park is at a distance of 20 kilometres from Ramnagar .
We were in Tiku near our resort park , which we had already registered .
Because of no special event everyday we went to roam the coast of Kosi first after getting cold .
After two-three hours we left for Corbett Museum , which was very difficult at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went to roam Ramnagar underneath .
It was late in the evening to return .
On seeing the tiger riding in the jungle I could see the tiger in a dream throughout the night after deciding from Delhi .
In the midst of deep night I heard a loud voice then dogs did not stand for two hours after bathing .
For this first one comes on the way to Kaladungi and Corbett .
There was a museum of Jim Corbett in Kaladunki where some familiar things related to their own life were kept .
The museum of Jim Corbett Museum in Kaladungi .
It was two and a half hours after returning .
Kaladunki is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett lived in this village .
On reaching the hotel the tourist gypsy was waiting for our arrival .
He told us that he was organised to roam around there in Saint Bijrani .
On asking about one trust the tigers come towards that side to stay in the winters due to excessively there .
As soon as we reached Bijarauli we were given a guide , we bought a hundred and fifty rupees to roam around for four hours .
We went out to go inside the show .
There are many types of birds and monkeys .
Inside we saw two tailed elephants , which had long teeth .
I took the picture standing .
In the middle of this the guide started trekking the foil .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park in which some tigers died in one year .
At many places we saw their footsteps , but I was sorry because I could not see the tiger .
On the third day we had to go back to Delhi .
The deficiency of not seeing the tiger in my brain was running .
Then I remembered the old friend of Halduwani .
I contacted him on the telephone.
I told him I was coming to the carpet.
I asked if I saw the tiger or not .
Her word swept like a mud .
I wasn't slow.
There is no permission to take the bicycle to the park .
Somebody told me to take a ride to go inside .
