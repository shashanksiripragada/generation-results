Their language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch and on the other side Gujarat is therefore a mixture of both in language .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although this is ' bid ' its own script .
If you have to write Kachchi then you have to write in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj itself is that Anjar city where earthquake has occurred many times and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal - Toral .
The story of Jaisal-Toral is very interesting .
If we come from the same way then we will have to take a lot of a month ' s holiday and on this side schools will open in Mumbai .
So what should you do  Now by making the fast buses of Gujarat travel by rail .
The small train of metrogen from the arm will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of metro trains will reach Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad a big train of broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
Tourist industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan 's economy is passing through bad times these days .
Due to the danger of increasing terror in global slowdown and South Asia tourism business has become a big hit .
From the point of view of tourism the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan being included in the major states of the country has been recorded very less these days .
The fresh figures announced recently by the Rajasthan government show that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 has decreased more than ten percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics there has been a decrease of 9 . 77 percent in the number of national tourists and 27 . 36 percent in the number of foreign tourists .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan in which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included whereas during 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
In this two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 77 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People associated with tourism are very worried because of this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Holiday makers of Rajputa says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have completely affected tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we have not been able to develop strong infrastructure of tourism there .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has also decreased by 3 . 29 percent in comparison to last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the highest .
After that tourists of Germany , England , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism recent years have been excellent for Rajasthan .
After 2002 this is the first time that the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
From the point of view of tourism nothing is happening .
Desert , havelis , forts , Wave Forest everything is old to serve tourists .
In the area of tourism the government increases the matter of working in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism , adventure tourism but nothing has been done in this direction .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
At the same time in recent years in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists the incidents of blasphemy and trembling have also made the image of this kingdom internationally .
Rajasthan government had given the status of tourism industry in the state years ago but it has remained consolidated only to papers .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government towards tourism .
With the aim of encouraging tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed RTDC in 1987 .
This corporation provides facilities of accommodation , food , transport , boating etc to the tourists .
There are a total of 75 units of this corporation .
In which 39 hotels , 22 big , eight cataracts , three passengers , one vehicle unit and two train palace on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels but the situation of this corporation has also worsened for many years .
The deficiency of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakh which is estimated to be 632 lakh in 2009 - 10 .
The condition of the hotels of this corporation is that in the last five years forty percent rooms of its hotels are also not filled .
Along with hotels other units of the corporation are also making it a big mistake .
The main among them is Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
This could not become the attraction of tourists towards the railway .
Despite reducing rent they could not attract tourists .
Similarly in recent years there has been a deficiency in the interest of tourists towards a lot of fairs .
In this fair in 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists stayed in the tourist village made by RTDC , this year this number decreased to 217 .
The satisfactory thing for RTDC is that there has been no dearth of attraction of tourists towards palace on wheels i . . royal train .
This railway is continuously benefiting .
Last year RTDC got the benefit of Rs . 9 . 5 crore from this railway .
Due to this deficiency in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to see the lines of concern in the tourism sector .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of the person then he can make gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has made it true by setting up modern city Amboveli in the hills of Sahyadri of Maharashtra .
Seeing the dream they had seen , the happiness of their eyes shines on seeing it progressing day by day .
His joy was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley has succeeded in making its place as an excellent city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities have been created only on 9 percent land .
On 91 percent land trees , ponds , lakes , fountains and other facilities have been made available .
Many entrepreneurs came forward to build their houses in this city built for only crores of sisters and today there are about 800 families in this city .
Initially industrialists and employees bought their houses in the form of Hollyday Home here now they have made them their first house and from here they travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley is Koirigarh Fort which provides beauty to this area .
The ruins of Likawali are very important in the western Siang district .

At this place a Dashabhuja statue of Devi Durgi has been found .
Several sweet stories and old stories are prevalent among the residents here after the name of this idol and place .
The ruins of Devalpani are still singing the pride of Arunachal .

The time of Chetia kings was recognised in the north - eastern hills far and wide of this goddess .
The people of the tribe here used to worship the goddess .

Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
It is called the ruins of Bhishmak city which is situated in the ground between Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the stories prevalent here this place is Vidarbha , where at one time king Bhishmak used to reign .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Lohit river , which is a famous place of Lohit district .
The tribes like Digaru , Mishmi etc . here give guidance to the travellers .
These people themselves also have a lot of faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund itself is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far-off places come here .
Besides the above mentioned ruins mentioned in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also very historical .
The ruins of brick lake near Roeing are still narrating their stories .
Being surrounded by bathing valleys , stairs and pucca forts from all sides of another pond and getting the ruins of wide roads are still singing the silence of its ancient grandeur .
We reach ero from North Lakhimpur city of upper Assam through jeep for four hours .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place hypnotises the hearts of the visitors .
This is that charming place where the parents live .
It took several days to reach here before the way of jeep was made .
On reaching here the views of high - tall cedar trees , beautiful primerose , voluntary , wild cart , strawberry and rosary enjoy the coming .
Apple and potatoes are produced a lot here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of the guests .
The people of the parents have made it their heaven with their unrest .
There is a lot of rice farming here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this surface is a living example of their labour and the skill of farming .
The need for its irrigation is fulfilled by the Kali river .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the redness standing in the sky on the horizon between the snow laden mountains of the left hand .
There is a good cold in the air .
Along with the coolness felt in the environment one also feels moisture .
With the sound of garbage below the legs the skull of the snow spread on the surface of the wood is seen .
There is smoothness in the atmosphere and there was nothing more visible because of the blurredness spread before sunrise .
The sight becomes stable on the redness of the east .
There is a feeling of sitting on the lying lying in the front .
The smooth skin of the wind gets stuck with the sound of normal waste and the hands get separated from the shock from the feeling of cold .
Thousands of miles away from its country , this is the first experience of spending the night coming in this small village situated amidst these hills covered with snow of Switzerland .
This is my third tour in Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent or passed near it .
On both the sides of the small flowing river and the dense population settled in the valley is spread to a great extent on normal slopes .
This is the main river of Switzerland Rhone valley on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
The road in front of the Ron river and the cars running on it are clearly visible .
300 kilometres away and half an hour journey from car , along with the equivalent of the Geneva lake and half the Ron river coming from the eastern direction , Genova lake near the city named Montra , which is called Lock Large .
On the western part of this lake 100 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide Jiniva city is situated .
From there the lake again turns towards the west after becoming a river .
On the left side there are Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps mountain ranges across the lake .
After crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we left this highway and came to the hilly path towards the north .
Due to the slope of the mountain being southward the sun of the afternoon is giving full heat to all the corners .
In comparison to the valley the quantity of snow is less here - almost not like .
As we move towards height , the density of snow has started increasing .
On both the sides of the road despite such a good snow being frozen there is no specific cold in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
After completing the journey of about 20 kilometres on this circular hilly road in half an hour we reached a small village named Thal .
Chalet slope is covered with roofs , completely large multi-modal bungalows made of wood .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , washing , along with parking of trains in Bhoyara made of cement cockroach of three storey bungalows .
Valai is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making wine wine .
There is cultivation of grapes on the ground of 37  of the entire canton .
In the villages situated on both the sides of the Ron Valley grapes gardens provide a magnificent area to its beauty .
To roam there to reach the grapes garden , to rest in the villages there and to taste alcohol by taking it to the factory of wine is an integral part of the tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of wine in a stronghold built in 12th century in a small village named Agae , to see which foreign tourists have to register before .
Once again we came out from the middle of that jungle which was frozen with palms .
For three - four kilometres the mind becomes very happy with the questions coming to the children on the whole road .
At one point suddenly a dramatic and charming change comes from the scene .
Just in front , on the top of the deep valley on the left side of the road a beautiful group of houses is settled .
People are skiing in ice on the flat slope from above the village .
Ahead of skiing slope the dense jungle of cedar is situated till the peak of the mountain .
There are snow covered all around .
The roofs of the houses of the population are shining due to the fall of the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
There is also peace here .
From the top of the mountains to the valleys all around the empire of white snow .
Within the next five minutes we reach a big circuit in the middle of that village .
The name of the town is Luckerabad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Luckerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists , sportspersons and health workers coming here can be estimated from this fact that there are 1700 apartments with capacity of 6900 beds and 28 hotels , camping sites , 90 bed health centers and 50 restaurants for staying in Shail 1500 .
65 springs of hot water have been found in Lukerabad till now .
The 40 lakh litres -LRB- daily -RRB- hot -LRB- up to 51o c . . -RRB- water coming out of it is transported to thermal bridges around 30 small and big bridges built at places in the whole town , some bridges are inside five star hotels and according to the wishes of the people of other different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels full heat .
In the blooming heat on the roof of houses the large surface of snow is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin .
Albenin village is one of the ' conserved in the form of ' national importance heritage ' in Switzerland .
It was told in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can only go to the taxis of Sikkim therefore checks are not done .
The journey is on , the region is second , but the mountain is the same , the trees and plants are the same , the bright winds are the same .
The moisture accumulated on the whole body is the same .
This is the same with blue colored water in the environment of rains .
On the completion of the plan of Darjeeling journey first it was decided to see the carsyang .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust forests .
Famous for production of excellent tea .
When we moved towards Darjeeling from Siliguri , initially welcoming tea gardens smiling towards itself .
For the first time passing through the road between the tea gardens hypnotise the heart .
On one side green mountains filled with jungles , on the other side deep green valley .
On this side sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens are seen .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I fell in unconsciousness , see these natural forests that the plants of tea planted by man .
Both were pulling towards themselves .
The beautiful jungle , the beautiful gardens of tea spread far and wide .
If you look at the roads of the road then the creation seems marvellous .
The curved and curved path of the snake was passing .
Time was also passing .
If we were not passing then forests and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements are seen .
From a distance itself a hilly house - house etc . started looking very dense .
This was Kurseong .
Staying here at one place we made a program of touring all day .
Hence taking a car we left on a tour of Kurseyong .
First of all dieer park .
A small garden surrounded by large jungles all around .
To reach the climb from above i . . the vehicle had to be left very low .
Despite being overwhelmed by the beauty of Kurseyong it could not be developed in the form of tourist spots .
Although the city is very beautiful and clean .
Despite being deserted the way the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the trees of dust was giving us courage .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
On the other side of this city is a point situated at a height .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that in the time of the British lovers used to give life to dogs from here .
Now , this is connected with a park and restaurant .
There is a stairsed dome here from the height of which a beautiful view of the whole city is present .
In the tea gardens around women were tired of breaking the tea leaves running hands with extremely strong speed on the back .
There is a museum outside the Kurseyag city on which we could not go there that day because touring the free environment of this garden felt very important .
On the next day it was decided to tour Darjeeling .
It was a thrilling experience in each other , but there was a big concern from it that if the rains were falling then how would we return .
But the coincidence was very good that on reaching till Rock Garden we returned enjoying the blooming sun .
This garden is a beautiful place blooming with wide rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more charming than that .
Going a little more down from here we found Ganga Maa surrounded by hills .
The specimens of waterfalls amidst the wide rocks from here are spectacular .
We saw in the Rock Garden that the waterfalls in the empire of rocks - wide rocks are enchanted here then the glimpse of waterfalls in Gangamaya is divided by stones .
These two places are very low in the middle of the hills of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of the vehicle we saw the loop of Batasia in Darjeeling .
The entire hill and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here with the help of a telephone .
The mood of the weather was still clean .
But where we moved towards the monastery , decreased as if from where we were present and started shining .
In the evening roaming and shopping was organised on Mall Road .
Toy train increases the joy of journey in the tour of Darjeeling .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to smoke and smoke to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
There is a little rest in boating and garden in the Mirik lake here .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar from this route where handmade sweaters of Nepali artisans etc . are available .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpong is somehow a city of Darjeeling district , but its form - color is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here , but the arrival of jungles and waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Lao and Lolegaon which is full of jungles and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Calcutta to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winter , but the tea gardens spread from Siliguri to Darjeeling stopped me here .
My recent journey was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither foreign nor outside Rajasthan , but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is a interesting subject in itself in which sometimes the journey draws towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , water ship or any city like a royal train or a rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people come out dragging .
The place where I am going to talk is ready about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place is situated there it has actually made it in the jungle .
Not only for the people going there but also for the people living there .
In my ears the words of my guide Ram Babu Meena , brothers before that we could not even think that we could live in the jungle like this .
Fifty percent staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that such local people did not get work in the heritage hotel as well .
Rambabu resident of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in this unique royal estimation of Aman Bagh .
They had thrown themselves into a new color to speak .
Sahiba ' is the estimate of Amman Bagh .
There nobody calls you from English conversation .
Amman Bagh is really an incomplete peace and all comfortable tour .
This garden also has its own history and the biggest thing is that it gets your identity even from the surrounding areas .
Some of the people spending holidays in the royal style of Rajasthan might have traveled to Bhangarh of Bhutan . Why to go far , some of the people of Jaipur may have spent night in this area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have gone there .
I also remember that night when Shaba ' s Azmi had called me there from Taluka but I could not go .
It is different that he himself had reached Bhangarh by forgetting the way .
This time on the invitation of my foreign guest suddenly I felt that those who want to spend a grand holiday in less time they should definitely go to Amman Bagh .
This garden is a garden left out of those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction was done in nineteen and twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh in the shadow of hills and dense trees hypnotise you .
As you come inside the way you are welcomed , it seems that the attention has been given here on divine peace .
Along with binding the mauli in Kanda the mantra of Mangalachar is lifted alive .
We had reached in the evening and we thought of killing a cycle in front of that garden .
My guest who has been adorning , suddenly spoken , ' This is very interesting ' .
All havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . There was no surprise that Aman Bagh has also got awards in recent times .
Manese decided our program for the morning .
First of all travel on foot with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which the light of the sun was spreading gradually .
We saw the dry lake in which the farmers were harvesting .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw tobacco farming .
For which such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh from jeep .
In the morning - morning I saw a tourist of Holland sitting in deep concentration .
This is an invaluable moment of million dollars .
The way to tell Amman Bagh was traditional , by feeding jaggery and curd they left us .
Now it has come to know why travellers come here by spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are also kept for showing tribal life .
Is this right
Of course this happens in one and not in many states and tourists also show a lot of interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
It also includes eating and staying there .
This way an attempt is made to discover such places where there was not much development and there was no effect of time on nature and lifestyle of people .
At the same time where ancient tourist places etc . are also present .
Besides this , concentration is also given on traditional cuisine .
Actually the purpose of such a tour is to make the tourists experience the lifestyle and traditions of that place .
Although it seems a little difficult to think , but such a tour is really interesting and makes a different kind of experience .
Bus tour has its own joy .
Despite being with many people you can enjoy roaming alone .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without opening your favorite book .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving a lot of time to spend less and peace the tour keeps the demand of your courage .
This is the reason that some things have to be kept in mind to accept it , especially then , some foreign places are going with the help of bus tour .
Check a good package before taking the ticket .
Students , officers of the armed forces , children etc get discount on them , then there is also a facility of relief for two people .
Although it is cheap to buy tickets beforehand , therefore in the last moments instead of fixing a bus tour it is better to organise a little before .
Get information about circular journeys without tickets on both sides .
This is cheap .
Regulations are special for goods , therefore ask about the height and weight of the goods .
It does not happen somewhere that you have to leave your luggage at the station or you have to pay more fees .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or loss filling from the tourist company .
Keeping bags with them are right , walk with them .
Because it gets alright in horse on the seat .
Also keep in mind that while changing the bus the responsibility of the luggage will be yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the coming season you should take special care of this thing .
Actually , as soon as you reach , you will have the best seat choice .
Keep in mind the convenience while fixing the seat .
If there will be a lot of shock on the last seat , then reading on the next seats will not be right .
If you have to go to urine again and again , then take a corner seat and if you do not like to be more troubled then the window seat will be appropriate for you .
Now the point of a walker .
If you are in the fracture of two seats , then sit on the corner seat before and put your bag on the other .
If there is no crowd in the bus , then the event will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then while fixing the seat also keep in mind this thing because it becomes difficult to sit there after some time .
Make identity with bus driver and conductor .
This way you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is called to go out .
During this do not keep your luggage on the seat because they do not take the responsibility of their disappearance .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the time of return .
If you do not come at the time , then you can get a new place and you will have to wait for another bus at the station .
It is said that if Rome was not seen in Europe then nothing was seen .
Rome , the capital of Italy , is a glorious city of ancient Europe and is famous for all its things .
Rome is the capital of Italy from those ancient cities of the world from where civilizations have developed .
This is the reason that its marks are seen on posthumous lifestyle .
Situated on the Taibar river , Roman is a pilgrimage for the followers of the Catholic religion , because this is the residence of the chief ' Pope ' of religion in Rome itself .
Ancient Rome was situated on seven hills .
In the fourth century a wall , cervical wall was built all around it .
Its ruins can still be seen around Rome .
Rome is famous worldwide for old buildings and their ruins .
This city with grand palace , grand church , beautiful fountains , domes and museums keeps a miracle of attracting you in the first glance .
This large and unmatched building of white marble dedicated to Italy ruler , Victor Immanuel II began to be built in 1885 and its work was completed in 1911 .
In front of it a statue on the horse of Emperor Imanuel is built , which took 20 years to build .
Here the unknowing soldiers who were martyred in the First World War were buried .
The carvings of this memorial and victory marks made on it are worth seeing .
There is also a museum here .
If you have juice in art galleries then definitely see it .
Along with the memorial is not only of Rome but also the famous and grand chowk of Italy ' Peja Venezia ' .
Built in the middle of Rome this chowk is famous as the Vijay Chowk of Delhi .
Besides this ' Piyatsa de spagna ' is also very popular among tourists and where people come to meet each other in the evening .
After enjoying ' Peja Venezue ' you must also go to the famous road of Rome i . . ' Via Deal Course ' .
The big shops , churches and palaces built here increase the grandeur of this road .
Keep in mind that this road is the main road of Rome .
This second building is built on ' Capeline Hill ' and is located at a great height .
Famous sculptor Michael Angelo had built the stairs to climb it in 1536 .
In front of Capitaline is the idol of Emperor Marcus Orelius on horse riding , who ruled Rome till 160 - 180 .
This grand idol will surprise you .
Besides this the tower built on Capeline is also a different identity of this building .
A church , museum and ancient temple are also built in ' Capitaline Complex ' .
The symptoms of Rome are colosium .
This large akhara was constructed in 80 AD and 50 thousand viewers could sit together here .
Gladiator i . . leopards used to show their art in Colosium .
They used to compete not only with each other but also with wild animals .
These fights shivering the heart , whether with other swords or with animals , continued till one of the fighters died .
There were many ' Forum ' in ancient Rome .
Tell us that the places of light mixture are called pharma in Rome .
All social , religious , economic , political etc . activities of the city used to happen here .
The most famous Forum was Romanam and the remains of Rajbhavan , temples and pillars are present at this place even today .
Undoubtedly on seeing this the grandeur of ancient Rome is estimated properly .
Pathyon : This magnificent ancient temple was built in 27 BC .
There is an open place of 30 feet in the middle of its large dome .
Due to this place devotees feel as if their prayers are reaching straight to the gods .
The idols of gods and goddesses are built all around inside the temple .
However , in 601 AD this temple was made a church .
Although there are many gardens in Rome , but Vila Borgis is unparalleled .
Therefore do not forget to see them while going to Rome .
Definitely go to the museum built here also , because by leaving it you will lose the chances of getting back from the best idol art .
The idols built here are unparalleled and it seems so alive that as if they will start speaking now .
Here Nepolian ancestor Paulin , whose marriage took place in the Borgis royal family , a idol lying on its bed looks so alive that you will not be able to stay without looking at it for a while .
The special attraction of Rome is their fountains .
There are about 300 buildings here in which grand fountains are made .
The most famous fountains here are ' Trivi Fountain ' .
It is believed that if you want to come to Rome again then you should put it in a coin fountain with this desire .
It is believed that by doing this this desire is definitely fulfilled .
The journey of this ancient city will not be completed until you see ' Vatican City ' .
From the sixth century this place has been the residence of the highest religious chief ' Pope ' of the followers of the Roman Catholic religion .
Although it is in Rome , but since 1926 it was given the status of an independent city .
Definitely see the famous St . Peter Church of Vatican City , St . Peter Square , Fountain , Museum etc .
Of course you will show the view of a different world and will always give you a memorable experience .

On the roads of Goa cycling , river cruise , cold sea winds and enjoying the full enjoyment of world famous Goan cuisines are the best options for spending comfortable days here .
In today 's date the fare for returning from Delhi to Maldives is 28 thousand rupees .
After this if you stay in Male even then hotels can be found at less rent but if you go to any island nearby to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be small .
C cruise proves to be beneficial here .
In the first week of December Lui cruise from Kochi started India 's only C cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Lui Virgin is a European company and is very impossible in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some difficulties Lui cruise has postponed its services now , but there is a possibility of it being regained from October .
You can go on a tour of Maldives for three days cruise at least Rs . 5850 per person per night on the ship MV Equamirin of Lui Cruise .
That is , the fare of one person for three days is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then children below the age of 15 years are completely free .
What else should be needed .
Tea - breakfast , meals all are included on the rent of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching the capital Malley you can enjoy the entertainments , activities available in Maldives from the point of view of your wish to underwater lunch .
While roaming in big airplanes suddenly a sea plane is standing in front of you then you will feel like sportsperson .
But this TV overplane with 12 - 15 seats is undisputedly excellent for touring the island group like Maldives .
Running like a speed boat on the surface of the water whenever it flies in the air , it is not known .
In the entire flight you do not feel the flight of normal airplanes .
Every time your sight keeps the bottom of the window , watching the resort islands and Koral islands in different shades of blue water of Maldives .
Everything looks so clear .
There are two C plane companies in Maldives .
Trace Maldives is one of them near which is C . Plain .
If you want you can travel air for about four thousand rupees -LRB- a person per hour -RRB- or the entire C plane can be taken on rent for your whole day tour -LRB- actually the size is big -RRB- .
Although if you go to any island before the island then the journey of the sea plane will be necessary because this is the only way to travel between different islands .
And that is such a journey which your mind will never be able to fulfil .
C plane travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- excellent Mavilevaru -RRB- in the islands of Maldives .
We were in the oldest and memorable shops of the capital in the Ahmad Bazar of Male .
All the sellers were listening very carefully to the speech given by the President of Maldives Mahmoud Nashid a day before in the World Climate Summit in Copenhagen .
If I say honestly then I have not seen any Indian listening to the speeches of the Presidents or the Prime Minister so carefully .
But when there is a question of the existence of an excellent creation of this earth then such seriousness was necessary .
Many people may have considered the meeting done inside the water by the Cabinet of Maldives in October , but after going to Maldives it seems that if the anger of nature snatches it from us then how much will the world become sealed .
Something like this is special in the beauty there .
I know in that small country that it is not so beautiful .
When the sight comes towards the jetty to go back to its cruise from the market easily , then it felt that the people here understand how much the price of this beauty .
The water was so clear that under the light of lamppost many metres deep the fish floating in the depths were seen with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which was completely connected to the city .
If you can clearly see some centimetres in the sea or river water connected to any city of India then you will consider yourself fortunate .
While returning to MV Aquamorin two hours of the evening melted in Male were roaming in the brain .
Coral riff -LRB- stones of stone -RRB- is the life here .
Even on the stones put on the tombs you will find stones of plains .
Some time before listening to the speech of President Nashid we were standing outside his government residence .
It was not believed that we were ahead of the residence of the best personality of any country , there were no security personnel till far .
With fun we were taking pictures of gardens and neighbours about 50 metres away by spreading hand inside the doors of their bungalows .
Can you think about the house of a common leader in India
It was also known that sometimes the President reaches his office ahead of two blocks crossing the road on foot .
Everything about Maldives was shocking .
That is why I was waiting for the next day 's authority .
It was known that that day was to be special .
In the morning a boat brought us to the airport island from Christmas .
From there we reached on the seat of Trans Maldives by cutting the rocks of the runway .
Last evening when the monkey was reaching near Male then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above .
He had so many photographs.
But then it was not known that on the next day it would get the opportunity to ride .
We had to go to Rangali Island at a distance of one hundred and five kilometres from the C plane of Trace Maldives .
From the sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres hundreds of resorts spread in the sea of Maldives and to see Koral islands were unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
It was a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching the Conrad Resort of Hillton Hotels on Rangali Island it felt as if we had reached some other world .
In such a world , which had no relation with any outside world .
The relation was also not so much that it was difficult to get out of the beauty or luxury there .
You can also walk on the canal or by battery operated car .
The view of life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main island was amazing .
Now we were not able to hear ourselves comfortably from the nature around , that we reached such a place , it was incomplete .
On descending down several metres below the stairs we reached such a room of glass which was inside the water .
This room was actually a food segment .
On all the sides of the glass we could see a unique kind of small and big fish , corals , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
The imagination of food sitting on a decorated table was very thrilling in itself .
On coming to this island from Male to C plane the fare for seeing and lunching underwater is only 47 thousand rupees for one person .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to bathe in the water of our family .
But we knew it was not possible .
Returning back with the desire of heavy mind sometimes , at some point the ship will definitely come here .
It was planning to go out of Delhi for many days but due to the busyness of work this was not possible .
If there was a joy of wildlife from childhood then thought why Jim Corbett should be gone this time .
After biking till Pegong lake ahead from Khardungla in Ladakh in 2006 this was the second like tour .
On the afternoon of 27 December we had to travel for Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the smoke that had emerged from Jorsor lost our speed .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tired .
Dhumals from above and bad roads in front .
Many times it felt that now it has fallen .
After doing anything we reached Gajrola at 8 o'clock in the morning .
Whether we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Amara was in Dhikuli near the resort park , which we had done beforehand .
On that day there was no special program but before being cold we came to tour the coast of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours there we left the Corbett Museum , which was very difficult 2 kilometres away near the Dhangadi gate .
From there we were going to visit Ramnagar below .
On returning it was evening .
It was decided from Delhi that if the lions roaming in the jungle would definitely see then I would see the tigers throughout the night in dreams .
Suddenly in the midst of dense night I got a strong pride and after that the dogs who started to swallow up did not stop for two hours .
Therefore there was a suggestion of touring Kaladhangi and Kabert waterfalls before .
Kaladhungi is 30 kilometres away while Corbett waterfall comes on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kaladangi where he has some important things related to his life .
On coming and drinking twelve o'clock .
Kaladhungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett had been coming to this village .
On reaching the resort the safari jeepsy was waiting for us .
It has been told that they have arranged for sighting in the number one side business there .
Asked about number one we said that there is more grassland and tigers come here to escape from cold during this time .
As soon as we reached Bijra we were given a guidance , which takes two and a half rupees to travel for four hours .
We had to leave for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
Inside we saw two tusks of elephants , whose long teeth were .
I did photography properly .
In the middle of this the guide started following the tigers .
The guide said that there are about 150 tigers in the park , out of which some have died recently .
At many places we also saw the marks of their claws but I was sad because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to come to Delhi .
In my mind the past of the tiger was in the morning .
Then I remembered an old friend of Haldwani .
I made him call the same way .
I told him that I am coming to carbonate .
He asked if the tiger looked or not .
His words were sounded like a sharp .
I said gradually , no .
There was no permission to take bike in the park .
Somebody advised us to take a ride for inside .
