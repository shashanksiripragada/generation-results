Their language looks different from Gujarati .

On one side of Kutch is Sind and on the other side Gujarat therefore there is a mixture of two in language .
This is called ' kitchen ' .

The tourism department considered to be the main base of the economy of Rajasthan is passing through bad governance at this time .
There is a serious obstacle in the tourism industry increasingly in Vaishno Devi and South Asia .
From the point of view of tourism the number of travellers coming to Rajasthan in comparison to the major countries of the country is less in these days .
It is said that the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan in the last year 2009 was more than ten percent less than 2008 .
The number of tourists in the country decreased by 98 . percent and the number of foreign travellers by 27 . 36 percent .
In 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 36 thousand 564 tourists came to Rajasthan out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included because between 2009 two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 691 countries and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists are included .
People associated with the tourism area consider this situation very well .
Sanjay Kaushik , chief of Rajputana Holiday Mekers , says that serious incidents like Vaishik Mandir have a bad effect on the tourism industry .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we do not develop the firmness and basic framework of tourism here .
This is the reason that in comparison to last year the number of foreign tourists coming to India decreased by 3 . 29 percent .
Most of the foreign tourists coming to India come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the highest .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
The attention of tourism continues to be better for Rajasthan every year .
This is the first time since 2002 that the number of travellers in Rajasthan has come down .
There is nothing new from the point of view of tourism .
Desert , big palaces , forts , wells , forests all these are old , to surprise the tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments go and go to work in the name of rural tourism , medical tourism and adventurous tourism but nothing is done in this direction .
The convenience of travellers coming to Rajasthan is very less .
At the same time in recent times in Rajasthan along with foreign women tourists the pictures of this country have been depicted internationally .
Years before the government of Rajasthan the tourism department had broken in the country , but it remained frozen in newspapers only .
Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- is an example of the success of the Rajasthan government in the matter of tourism .
With the aim of enhancing tourism in Rajasthan and developing the infrastructure of tourism the Rajasthan government had formed a RTDC in 1979 .
These corporations are available for the stay of tourists , food , pockets , boating etc .
The houses of this corporation are 75 units .
Of them 39 hotels , 22 hotels , eight cafeteria , three roads , one line unit and two train palaces on Hills , Royal Rajasthan on Hills , but the situation of this office has been deteriorating for many years .
The loss of arthritis in 2008 - 09 is 185 lakh and in the next year in 2009 - 10 it is estimated to be 63 lakh .
The condition of the hotels of this office is this that in the last five years the rooms of its hotels are not filled in the fourth square metre .
Along with the hotels the other units of Madurai also make it a big loss .
Among these Royal Rajasthan of Hills are main .
This train does not attract tourists towards this train .
Because of being less rent this does not attract tourists .
In such a situation the desire of tourists towards Pushkar Mela has been seen decreasing .
In 2007 - 08 in this fair made by RTDC in the tourism village where 398 foreign tourists stayed , the number of this year has decreased to 217 .
In the middle of all this it is a pleasant thing for RTDC that there is no dearth of the attraction of tourists towards Palace on Hills and Shahi train .
This train continuously benefits .
Last year RTDC has benefitted nine crore rupees from this train .
It is natural to see the shadows of doubt on the tourist spots from this fall coming in the tourist spot of Rajasthan .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economic situation of Rajasthan .
If there is a desire to do something in the mind of humans then they make gold from the earth .
This can be really seen in the modern city Embo Valley situated in the Sahyadri mountain range of Subradrai Maharashtra .
When he dreamed of enhancing it then his eyes were shining .
His joy was also in the sight of the inauguration of his own airport of Amba Valley .
The work of Amba Valley started and today Amba Valley is in the form of a better city .
In this city spread over more than 10 thousand acres hotels , houses and other facilities are available at a height of 9 square metres .
In 91 square metres trees , ponds , lakes , gardens and other facilities are available .
In this city built for the cottage couples many enthusiasts came forward to build their houses , today about 800 families live in this city .
Initially travellers and races took their birds in the form of a holiday house , but now it has also turned into its first house and there was also a hustle-bustle of bombs for employment from here .

At a height of approximately 4500 feet these beautiful hilly places hypnotise the hearts of the guests .
This is such a charming place where there are falls .

This place is the treasure of neck .
Ten miles long this place is a living example of their hard work and the ability to cultivate .
The need to wet it from the river of Kali is fulfilled .
Pine tree shines like a moon in the beauty of this valley .
In the middle of the snow laden mountain ranges on the left side of the eyes fell on the light arising in the sky of the cyclone .
The wind is very cold .
One also knows the moisture along with the cold on climbing on the ground from the environment .
Below the legs one looks at the particles of snow falling at the end of the wood like a roaring sound .
The surroundings are silent and because there is no more light before sunrise .
The eyes fell towards the eastern Arunima .
One feels like sitting in the bunch put in the balcony .
As soon as the hand is moved , the shining surface of the snow is sort of hard and the hand swallows immediately when it feels cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , in this small village settled in the middle of the snow laden mountains of Switzerland this is my third foreign residence in life .
This is my third foreign country in Swiss .
Before this sometimes geneba or its surroundings are eaten .
The slopes of the densely densely populated slopy slopes situated in the valley on both the sides of the flowing river are spread very high .
This is the main river of Switzerland , on both the sides of the valley of Ron , many small and big cities .
Gradually moving trains can be seen through the parallel national highway of Ron river .
300 kilometres away and if elephant on the way of two and a half an hour in the car , then along with the parallel of the Geneva lake and half the Rona river coming from the eastern direction along with the city named Montre , Geneva lake is also called French -LRB- Leklemon -RRB- .
Geneva city is situated in the west part of this 100 km long and 10 km wide lake .
From there the lake later turned into a river and spread towards the west .
On the right side on the side of the lake is the mountain ranges of white and umbrella Alps .
On the right side crossing a beautiful small city named Luke we reached the Northern mountain path by ignoring this highway .
In comparison to the valleys the level of snow is less here - is not almost equal .
In comparison to the valleys the level of snow is less here - is not almost equal .
As the slope rises upwards the beauty of the snow increases .
On both the sides of the road there is no cold in the air because of the change of smooth , clear sky and bright sun .
We reached a small village named Thal after making a journey of about 20 kms on this Khumavadar mountain road within half an hour .
There are slopy roofs of stones and big two storeys made of wood .
Based on the cement concrete of this three storeyed palace -LRB- basement -RRB- , along with the parking of trains , there is also a group of controlling the requirements like electricity , water and cookies .
In the right Switzerland is famous for grape cultivation .
This is the main center of making wine of grapes .
37  of the total continent is the farming of grapes in the earth .
The grapes gardens in the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley provide a marvellous description of its beauty .
Go to the area of grapes gardens , travel there and rest the night in the villages there and go to the grapes factory and test it , all this is the holistic part of the tourism industry here .
There is a very big collection of grapes in a fort built in the 12th century in a small city named Aizawl , to see which foreign tourists do booking beforehand .
Once again our people passed through that deserted jungle with wildlife .
The whole path of three-four kilometres is troubled by the questions of the climbing up of the children .
Suddenly with a curved view dramatic and beautiful changes are made .
Just near on the left side of the road in the upper area of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is standing .
People skiing in the snow in the upper area of the villages .
On the top of the skiing slope the dense jungle of Deodar is spread till the peaks of the mountain .
On all sides there are heavy moisture falling .
The roofs of the houses are shining because of the direct rays of the sun falling .
Within five minutes we reached the village .
Here also the same silence is shadowed .
All around from the peaks of the mountain to the peaks of the valleys there is a synonym of beautiful snow .
In the next five minutes we reached a big round in the middle of that small city .
The name of the small city is Lucker Bad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Luckerabad is approximately 1500 .

It is said in Darjeeling that only the taxis of Sikkim go so that the test is not done .
The journey is going on , the area is another , but the mountain is the same .
The cold of the whole body is the same .
The black color of the rainy season is also for me .
When the plan of the journey of Darjeeling was decided to see the views of Karzyang first .
Carsiang is a small town in Darjeeling.
Full of tea gardens and dense forests are full of tea gardens .
Best tea is famous for producing .
When climbing from Siligudi to Darjeeling then initially the tea gardens smile and welcome the people coming there .
On passing through the road between tea gardens for the first time charms the heart , is one of the protected places in the form of wealth .
On one side the green mountain full of jungles on the other side is a deep green trench .
If there are forests here then tea gardens can be seen in the middle .
All around is the empire of greenery .
Once I am embarrassed to see these natural jungles or tea plants planted by humans .
Both attract themselves .
The beautiful jungle is as beautiful as the tea gardens spread .
If the eyes go on the roads then the creation is amazing .
In the shape of serpents we crossed the right and circular path .
Time also passes .
Forests and tea gardens do not end .
Sometimes small huts are seen .
From a distance itself one can see a lot of concentration from houses and buildings on a mountain .
It's Carcian.
Staying here at one place we prepared a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is , if you take a train and get out of the car .
First of all, Deer Park.
A small garden is surrounded by large forests all around .
To reach the deer park the train descended very low .
Besides being filled with the beauty of Karshianga it has not yet developed in the form of tourist spots .
Because the city is so good and clean .
The desire to reach the deer park surrounded by jungles and the joy of climbing the road between the trees of the sun gives us adventurousness .
The nearest place is Igel Craiga .
This is a point situated at a height on the other side of the city .
This is called Suicide Point .
During the period of English the companions used to go to sermons from here .
Hill hall is a park along with a restaurant .
There is a fort of stairs , from which the view of the whole city can be seen .
In the nearby tea gardens , women are filled with sucking tea leaves with their hands very quickly on the outskirts of the big intestine .
There is a museum outside the Karsian city but on that day we did not go there because it was more necessary to travel through the open environment of tea gardens .
The next day we decided to go to Darjeeling .
This was a thrilling experience for me , but there was a lot of concern about how we roamed on rains .
But the reality was very good that after reaching Rock Garden we roamed around enjoying the sun .
This garden is a beautiful place decorated with rocks , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On descending down a little from here we saw the Ganges surrounded by mountains .
Here amidst the rocks the magnificence of waterfalls can be seen .
In Rock Garden if the waterfalls in the Empire of rocks and rocks are shining then the magnificent world of waterfalls in Gangamaya can be seen blooming with stones .
These two places are located very low in the middle of the mountains of Darjeeling .
On climbing up with the help of the train we saw the unforgettable views of Darjeeling .
With the help of television all the mountains of Darjeeling can be seen from here .
The condition of the weather is clear till now .
But if we reach Monastery then you can see the crowd of clouds standing .
In the evening somewhere or the other shines .
In the journey of Darjeeling tower trains can also be enjoyed .
From Darjeeling to Dhum , from Dhum to Darjeeling the journey of tower train attracts tourists specially .
Boating in the Mirik lake here and a little rest in the garden .
Tourists go to Pashupatinath market through this way , where the handmade and sweater of Nepali artisans are available .
There is arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Kalimpog is a city of Darjeeling but its shape and color are different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here because forests , waterfalls and waterfalls are the residences .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpog is Lava and Lole village which is full of forests and waterfalls .
But in the absence of time we did not go to Kalimpong this time .
We came to Darjeeling from Calcutta to tour Darjeeling in the shadow of winter but the tea gardens spread here from Siliguri to Darjeeling connected me towards itself .
If I am in my state then a small journey is very thrilling and thrilling .
This journey is not foreign but outside Rajasthan because it is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting thing for me , in which some travel attracts me , but sometimes some special places like water ships or any rock train or lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some special attraction people get attracted .
The place where you went to do the work was prepared about four and a half years ago , but with those preparations this place came there they really enjoyed .
Not only for those going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears the sound of my guide Rambabamina shouts , the lord did n't think before that how did we stay in the jungle .
Ninety percent workers are also in this area .
Suddenly I felt that people of such a place were not working in the heritage hotel .
Rambabu dwellers of Ajabgarh had earlier worked in Jaipur , now in this strange ambience sufficient ambience .
He himself has turned into a new color.
Master ' is the synonym of amman garden .
There nobody calls you English at all .
Amman Garden is actually a hustle-bustle of peaceful and with all the conveniences .
The garden has its own history , the biggest thing is that it is introducing itself through the neighbouring areas .
How many people travelled to Dung of the enemies in Amber Praui of Rajasthan , why should you go far , some people from Jaipur may spend night in this area .
After the opening of the Amal garden big people from the country and abroad come there .
Shabana Assam called me there very lovely but that night I did not go .
Its fame is different which reaches Dang on its own way .
This time I came there in the humility of our foreign guest , but those people started spending a grand vacation in some time , where you must go to Amman Garden .
This garden is the only garden protected from those seven gardens , where the king of Alwar made a camp for hunting .
Its construction was done in 19th and 20th .
Its old walls are witnesses of those days .
Surrounded by mountains and witnesses of strong trees .
As soon as you come inside you will welcome you , from which it feels as if you have taken care of the irregular peace here .
Along with putting the rod in the fold the mantra of mangalachara should be kept active .
On reaching Leh in the evening we planned to roam around in this garden .
My guest Jackie enjoys our minds as a decorative and artificial .
Everything is inspired by big palaces and palaces .
The most beautiful is its lighting .
Everything new and artistic is not surprising .
The manager prepared our program for the morning .
First of all along with Rambabu on foot and then the jeep journey of Darang .
On walking on the way to Sankri we saw the fort of Ajbag , in which gradually the rays of the sun spread .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers used to cultivate .
This year there was no rain but for the first time tobacco farming was found .
The beauty of the rural life of Jackik is a unique experience .
After that we reached Dang in the jeep .
In the morning I was watching a tourist of Holland very carefully .
If this is a milenium dollar valuable moment .
The journey of Amman Garden is the tradition and tradition of compassion and by giving horse and curd he left us .
Now it has come to know why tourists come here with so much cost .
I have heard that there are tours to see the life of the tribals as well .
Is this right
Beshk is not one such , is in many countries and tourists are particularly enjoyable in it .
This tour is generally prepared from four days to two weeks and in the middle of this tourists are included in other places .
In this wherever you stop , food is also included .
This way such places try to explore where there is not much development and there the lifestyle of nature and people does not affect the time .
At the same time old tourist spots are also there .
Besides this one also pays attention to distributing traditional cuisines .
Actually the meaning of such a tourism is to understand the customs and traditions of the tourists in that area .
Although it has a little difficulty in thinking , but such a tour is a charming and a different kind of experience .
Going to tour in bus is a pleasure for us .
In this you can enjoy roaming alone because of being with many people .
Not only this if you take your favorite book in this journey then you will get more time in trouble .
Yes , it is so important that along with giving less and less comfortable moments this tour is definitely advisable to you .
To enjoy this some things should be kept in mind especially if you are watching any foreign destination by bus tour .
Before taking the ticket one should find a good deal .
Students , elders of the army , children etc . get benefits in this but for others also the benefits are available .
Although there is an arrangement for taking tickets in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very good to arrange a tour on the bus , but the arrangement should be done shortly .
Although there is an arrangement for taking tickets in advance , therefore in the last minute it is very good to arrange a tour on the bus , but the arrangement should be done shortly .
It's cheap.
The method of taking the baggage is especially serious , therefore tell about the size and weight of the objects .
Perhaps it does not happen that you have to leave some things in terminal or you have to pay more money .
Together with this one should know the rules of giving insurance or loss to the tour company .
Keep the carriage on bags minute and take it .
Because the rock comes on the top of the hip .
This thing should also be kept in mind that while bus service between tour the responsibility of the goods is in itself .
Wherever you want to climb by bus reach there an hour before .
During the curving period you should pay special attention to this thing .
Actually as soon as you come , you will have to choose as good hips as soon as possible .
While choosing the hips keep in mind whether there is a cafort .
In the back hips there is a lot of shivering , but reading sitting in front of the hips is not cafortable .
If you want hot wind many times then you will take hips on the sides but if you do not want to make more trouble then the hips of the end are better for you .
Then it's a matter of intelligence.
If you are in anxiety to move both then sit on the hips of the first side and keep a bag on the hips .
If you are in anxiety to move both then sit on the hips of the first side and keep a bag on the hips .
But if the bus is busy then the program will be successful .
Introduce bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get enough information from them .
Everybody wants to go out while cleaning the bus .
During this time do not leave your luggage in smoothness , because if you want it then people of the bus do not take responsibility of it .
Wherever the bus stops , come back at the time .
If you do not come at the time then you will get a place of some new traveller and you will have to wait for another bus in the terminal .

The ship of Louis Cruise at the minimum rate you can go to the end of Maldives for three days including at least Rs . 5850 per person .
That is , for three days the cost of one person is less than 18,000 rupees .
Not only this , if you are two people then the whole of the child of the age of 15 years is normal .
What else do you want
In some of the cruise tea - breakfast is included .
Then the whole time smile.
On reaching the capital Mala you can enjoy the roaming and activities available on the Maldives according to the length of kiss - from the journey of sea plane to the lunch between water .
By roaming in big airplanes you will feel that if a plane comes in front of you then you will be playing .
But the 12 - 15 seated Tivanam Outer flight is excellent in the form of definite tourism in the group of Maldives like Maldives .
When the speed boat runs in the waterfall , when it flys in the air , it is not known .
In all flights you will not feel like a normal plane .
Your guidance will always be below the window - on different sides of the Maldives look at resort islands and Koral islands in blue water .
Everything looks very clear.
There are two air companies in Maldives .
Trans is one of these in Maldives , which has 20 airplanes .
If you want then you can travel for an hour in about 4000 rupees -LRB- every person -RRB- or you can rent the entire C flight throughout the day -LRB- if you want to pay the amount of money -RRB- .
If you are going to any other island from Maldives then it is necessary to travel through different islands .
You will never feel this journey to stop .
C - aircraft travels from 12 k . . to 183 k . . on Maldives .
We were in the largest ancient and grand shop of the Ahmedabad market of Mala .
All the people standing in the shop were trying very carefully by the President of Maldives , Mohammad Nasheed a day before at the World Climate Conference held in Rapan Gun .
In fact , I have not seen a Hindustani either the President or the Prime Minister listening so carefully .
But because of the question of the stability of a creation that remains indiscriminately of this land it is better to imbibe silence .
Many people call the conference going inside the water through the Maldives cabinet in October , but on going to Maldives it feels that if the natural calamity is deprived of us then how poor the earth will be .
There is a speciality in the beauty there .
In that small country so much beauty can not be covered .
To go back to your cruise from that edge of the market you will have to move towards the jetty , to know how much people know this beauty by walking through the road .
The water is so clean that the fish swimming deeply under the light of the candlestick can be seen with all their colors .
This is a part of the sea connected with the city .
You will be surprised to see some kilometres of clean water in the sea or river connected to any city of India .
M . . Akva returned to Marine and spent two hours in the evening in Mala was not clear .
Bears are the life here .
Here you will get pine trees till the rocks on the tombs .
To listen to the linguistic language of President Nashid we were out of his office some time ago .
We could not believe that a country was before the house of the best person .
With great interest we took pictures of the gardens and courtyards around 50 metres simultaneously through the door of his bungalow .
You can think like this before the house of any leader in India .
It is believed that by traveling on foot the President sometimes goes to his office for two blocks .
All the things related to Maldives were changing on one side .
That is why I am waiting for the next day .
I knew it would be a special day.
In the morning we reached the airport in Cruise .
From there we reached the place named Trams Maldives by roaming through the railway .
Last evening when we reached Cruise Mala then we returned the C - plane that went ahead .
There were many pictures of it .
But the next one did not know that he could walk in it .
We had to go to Rangoli Island 105 kilometres away through Trans Mall TV C - Airways .
It is an unforgettable view to see hundreds of resorts and pavilion islands spread over the sea of Maldives through a sea plane flying at a height of about 100 metres .
This beauty of water can not be seen anywhere else .
There was a journey to stop breathing with thrill and joy .
But when we felt as if we had reached a different world in the Rangoli resort of the Hillton Hotels of Rangoli Island .
There's no other world that doesn't belong to the outside world.
There was also anxiety that this kind of beauty and glory would be found somewhere outside .
Travelling on foot and car running in battery can be done in Karnad .
The view of water life on both the sides of the bridge going from Jetty to the main islands is amazing .
Now we came to the place after being able to bear ourselves from nearby nature , which was far more than thinking .
With the help of stairs we descended down a few metres below the sea and reached a glass room inside the water .
That room was actually a pillar.
On all sides small and big fishes , pavilions , snorkelling and scuba diving have also been seen .
It gives us a thrill in thinking of eating food sitting in decorated tables there .
The cost of seeing this island by air from Mala and eating lunch inside the water is Rs . 47 , 000 .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to drive our passport in water .
But I knew it wasn't possible.
If there is a fate with heavy mind then somebody can come here again .
For some days the plan to go out of Delhi was being prepared but this was not possible because of the busyness of the work .
Since childhood wild life was an excitement , why didn ' t you think of going to Jim Corbett
In 2006 before the Cardungala pass in Ladakh this is the second bike tour after cycling till Pegong Lake .
In the morning of 27 December we left for the goal of Jim Corbett from Delhi , but the joys that came out , the snow stopped our journey .
The journey between Hapudi and Gauda was brilliant .
Snow shrinking from the top and crushed in front.
It seems to have fallen several times .
One way we reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
We reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
We were in Dikuli near our resort park , whose booking was done before .
There was no specific program but despite winters we went on walking on the edge of Kosi .
After spending 2 . hours there we went to Corbett Museum .
From there we went down to Ramnagar .
On coming back the night was very late .
On coming from Delhi it was decided that lions roaming around in the jungle would definitely be seen and I had lions all around in the dreams of all night .
In the midst of the darkness of the night I heard a horrible confusion and after that till 2 o'clock the tips did not stop .
The first opinion was to visit Kalabhangi or Corbett waterfall .
Kalbhangi is at a distance of 30 kms but Corbett was on the way to the waterfall .
Several things related to his life have been reviewed in the museum of Corbett Saheb of Kalbhungi .
At 12:30 in the night when you come back.
Kalbhangi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett has begun to stay in this village .
When we reached the resort the safari gypsy was covering us .
He used to make arrangements for sighting in the first Bijarani there .
When asked about the first number it was said that due to the excess of grass the tiger had come here to save from winters .
As soon as we reached Bijrani, we gave us a guide.
We prepared for the jungle inside .
We prepared for the jungle inside .
Inside we saw two dozen elephants , their horns were very big .
I took a lot of pictures.
The guide began to find the way to the tiger.
The guide said that there are only 150 tigers in the park , some of them died now .
At some places we saw the marks of their nails but we were sad because they were not able to see them .
On the third day we had to stay in Delhi .
The whole tiger safari was in my thought .
Then I remembered an old friend in Haldani .
I just called him.
I told you I was coming to Corbett.
He asked if I could see the tiger or not.
His words rolled down like a stranger .
I said slowly, no
There was no permission to bring a bike to the park.
Somebody advised me to make a ride inside.
