Its language looks different from Gujarati .
Yes , it is different .
On one side of Kutch is a mixture of both Sind and on the other side in the form of Gujarat .
It is called ' kachchi ' .
Although this is ' speaking language ' , it does not have its own such inscription .
If you want to write Kutchi then it has to be written in Gujarati script .
Near Bhuj is Anjar city where many times earthquakes have occurred and the whole city has been destroyed .
Near Anjar is the tomb of Jaisal-Toral .
The point of Jaisalmer - Tharal is very interesting .
If you come to Maghari on the same road then you will have to take a complete one month holiday and the school will start there in Mumbai .
So what should be done  Now travel by rail by communicating fast trains of Gujarat .
Small rail of meter gauge from Bhuj will reach Rajkot .
From there another small train of meter gauge will reach Ahmedabad and a big train from Ahmedabad to Broad gauge will reach Mumbai .
The tourism industry considered to be the main base of Rajasthan 's economy is going through bad conditions these days .
Due to the danger of global slowdown and increasing terrorism in South Asia tourism business has become serious .
With the point of view of tourism special deficiency has been registered in the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan counted among the major states of the country .
According to the figures published by the Rajasthan government in the last year 2009 the number of tourists coming to Rajasthan has decreased more than 10 percent in comparison to the year 2008 .
According to statistics the number of national tourists 9 . 87 percent and the number of foreign tourists has decreased by 27 . 36 percent .
In Rajasthan in 2008 a total of two crore 98 lakh 26 thousand 564 tourists came out of which two crore 83 lakh 58 thousand 918 countries and 14 lakh 77 thousand 646 foreign tourists were included and in 2009 a total of two crore 66 lakh 32 thousand 105 tourists came to Rajasthan .
Among these two crore 55 lakh 58 thousand 619 countries and 10 lakh 73 thousand 414 foreign tourists were included .
People related to tourism are very worried about this situation .
Sanjay Kaushik , director of Hollyday makers in Rajput says that global slowdown and terrorist incidents have had a bad effect on tourism business .
In comparison to other countries of Asia we could not even develop a strong base of tourism here .
This is the reason that the number of foreign tourists coming to India has decreased by 3 . 29 percent in the last year .
Of the foreign tourists coming to India 21 percent tourists come to Rajasthan .
Among the foreign tourists coming to Rajasthan tourists of France are the most .
After this tourists of Germany , Britain , America and Italy like Rajasthan .
With the point of view of tourism Rajasthan has proved good for the past few years .
This is the first time since 2002 when the number of tourists in Rajasthan has come down .
From the point of view of tourism nothing like this is happening .
Desert -LRB- desert -RRB- , havelis , forts , ponds , forests all are old to see tourists .
In the area of tourism all the governments talk about rural tourism , medical tourism , adventurous tourism but nothing is done in this regard .
Tourists coming to Rajasthan also get very less facilities .
Besides this , these incidents of bravery and sedition of foreign women tourists have blamed this state internationally .
Rajasthan government had given tourism the status of industry in this state a long time ago but it had remained limited to paper itself .
One example of the success of Rajasthan government in tourism is the Tourism Development Corporation Limited -LRB- RTDC -RRB- .
To encourage tourism in Rajasthan and to develop tourism infrastructure the Rajasthan government established RTDC in 1979 .
This institute provides facilities like housing , food , communication , boating etc to tourists .
There are a total of 75 departments of this institute .
In which 29 hotels , 22 models , eight cafeteria , three commuters , one commuter and two train palaces on wheels and Royal Rajasthan on Wheels have also worsened but for some years the situation of this institute has also worsened .
The loss of RTDC in 2008 - 09 was 185 lakhs which is likely to be 632 lakhs in 2009 - 10 .
The situation of the hotels of this corporation is this that in the last five years even forty percent of its hotels have not been filled .
Along with hotels other components of the institute are also harming it .
Among these are Royal Rajasthan of Wheels .
Tourists did not get attraction towards this railway .
Even by reducing the fare they could not attract tourists .
Similarly in the present year there has been a rivalry among the tourists about the fairs .
In the year 2007 - 08 where 398 foreign tourists had stayed in the tourist village built by RTDC in this fair , this year there has been a decrease in this number and it is 217 .
The most satisfactory thing with RTDC was that there was no dearth of tourism attraction for Palace on Wheels i . . Shahi train .
This train has been very beneficial .
Last year RTDC had the benefit of nine and a half crore rupees from this train .
With this slowdown coming in the area of tourism in Rajasthan it is natural to have an atmosphere of concern in the area of tourism .
Tourism is the biggest base of the economy of Rajasthan .
If there is desire to do something in the mind of the person then he can take out gold from the soil .
Subrata Roy has shown this true by setting up modern city Ambo Valley in the range of Sahyadri mountains of Maharashtra .
The dream that he had dreamed is getting joy in his eyes seeing progressing everyday .
His joy was also seen during the inauguration of the private airport of Ambe Valley .
The work of Ambe Valley started and today Ambe Valley succeeded in building its place in the form of a unique city .
In this city spread over 10 thousand acres there are only 9 percent hotels , houses and other facilities on the ground .
On 91 percent ground trees , ponds , ponds , fountains and other facilities have been provided .
Many industrialists came forward to build their houses in this city built for crores of people and today around 800 families have lived in this city .
Initially industrialists and entrepreneurs bought their Asia in the form of Hollyday Home but now they have made it their home and travel to Mumbai for work .
Behind Ambe Valley is Koirigarh Fort which gives the beauty to this premises .
The ruins of Leekawali in West Siang district are very important .
The ruins of a large temple have been found while excavating .
On the pillars of stones of this temple the carving work of idols of lotus and gods and goddesses is found which is mostly in a ruined state .
Malini Than is an important place in this very area .
At this place a Dussehra idol of Durga Devi is found .
Behind the name of this idol and place many sweet stories and ancient stories are prevalent among the residents here .
The ruins of Devlpani are still singing the pride of Arunachal .
The temple of Tamareshwari Devi found in this ruins is very famous .
Its roof is made of copper .
In ancient literature and mythological stories the description of the month of Tamareshwari Devi is found .
During the time of Chetia kings this goddess was recognised far and wide in the hills in the north - east .
The people of the tribe here used to worship Goddess .
The sacrifice of humans was also given here which was later closed by King Gaurinath Singh .
Some other ruins have been found in the Lohit district of Arunachal .
These are called the ruins of Bhishmak city which are located in the middle of the Dibang and Diwang rivers here .
According to the brave legends this place is ancient Vidarbhan , where at some time king Bhishmak used to rule .
Brahmakund is situated in the lower part of the Ironit river , which is a famous place of the Ironit district .
Digaru , Mismi etc . groups here guide the tourists .
These people themselves have great faith in this pond .
Near the Brahmakund is the famous Parashuram Kund .
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti devotees from far-off places come here .
Besides the above ruins described in the form of pilgrimages of Arunachal the ruins of Roing in Diwang - Valley district are also historically important .
The ruins of brick ponds near Roing are still talking about themselves .
The ghats of bathing , stairs , and being surrounded by pucca shores all around the other ponds and getting the ruins of wide roads are still singing the silence of our ancient grandeur .
We reach ero in four hours through jeep from the city of upper Assam North Lakhimpur .
This place is the headquarters of Lower Subansiri district .
At a height of approximately 4500 feet this charming mountainous place attracts the hearts of the tourists .
This is that charming place where people of the Indian community live .
It took several days to reach here before the road of jeep became .
On reaching here the views of high - tall cedar trees , beautiful premroj , volume , wild curants , strawberries and rasberries enjoy the tourists .
There is a lot of production of apple and albukhara here .
There is a valley spread till 26 kilometres at a height of about 1524 metres .
This beautiful valley is the residence of its people .
With its untiring hard work the people have made it their heaven .
There was a lot of rice farming here .
This place is the store of rice .
Ten miles long this plain is a vibrant example of the hard work and skill of agriculture .
The need for irrigation of black river roots is fulfilled .
Pine trees enhance the beauty of this valley .
The sight falls on the light redness coming from the sky on the horizon between the queues of the snow laden mountains of the left hand .
There is good cold in the air .
Along with the coolness touching the environment one also feels wetness .
With the sound of garbage below the legs one gets to see on the layer of leaves sitting on the wooden furnace .
There is humidity in the environment and because of the expansion of joint light before sunrise there is no more visible .
The vision remains stuck on the redness of the east .
The desire to sit in the balcony lying in the balcony .
As soon as the hand starts , the layer of snow in the pink layer gets stuck with a light sound and the hand gets stuck in the moments of cold .
Thousands of miles away from our country , this is the first experience in the life of spending the nights coming in this small village settled amidst these snow laden mountains of Switzerland .
This is my third journey in Swiss .
Before this a lot of time was spent in Jeneba or around it .
On both the sides of the turbulent Balkhati river the thick colony settled in the valley is spread up to a great extent on the light slope .
This is the valley of Rone the main river of Switzerland on both sides of which many small and big cities are settled .
On the eastern highway of Ron river and trains running on it are clearly visible .
300 kms away and a journey of two and a half hours of carnie is half road , along with the eastern side of the Geneva lake and along with half the Ron river , the Geneva lake near the city named Montreux which is called Lake Lemon -LRB- Lock Lemon -RRB- .
100 kms long and 10 kms wide Jeneva city is situated on the western tip of this lake .
From there the lake again moves towards the west after becoming a river .
On the right side on the side of the lake are the slopes of Dhawal , Gaganchumbi Alps .
After crossing a beautiful small city named Leuke we left this highway and come on the northern hilly road .
Because of being the slope of the mountain towards the south the sun of the evening is giving a lot of light to all the eyes .
The quantity of snow is less here than the valley - almost not along .
As the height moves ahead , the density of snow has started increasing .
Despite a good ice accumulated on both the sides of the road there is no special coldness in the air because of clean sky and shining sun .
On this rotating hilly juice we reached a small village named Thel -LRB- THEL -RRB- by deciding about 20 km journey in half an hour .
Shailet -LRB- Chalet -RRB- - There are large and big multi-storeyed bungalows made of wood with slopy roofs .
There are rooms to control the necessary services like electricity , water , laundry along with parking of trains in the basement made of cement contract of this three storey bungalow .
Valai is famous for grape farming in Switzerland .
This wine is the main center of making grapes drink .
The farming of grapes was done on 37  of the entire Cantonment .
In the villages settled on both the sides of the Ron Valley grapes gardens give a marvellous dimension to the beauty there .
To take the bottom of the gardens of vineyards , to roam around them , to rest in the villages there and to enjoy wine tasting in the factory of grapes are integral parts of the tourism business here .
There is a very big museum of alcohol made of grapes in a small fort built in the 12th century in a small town named Aigle , to see which foreign tourists have to register forward .
Once again we went through the same jungle from Dawanal .
Till three - four kms the mind becomes even more happy with the questions of boring children throughout the road .
There is a dramatic and charming change from the scene on a move suddenly .
Just in front , on the left side of the road on the top of the deep valley a beautiful group of houses is located .
People are skiing in the snow on the flat slope situated in the upper part of the village .
The dense forest of cedar is spread up to the peak of the mountain above the skiing slope .
There is a dense snow all around .
The roofs of the houses of the colony are shining due to the direct rays of the sun .
In five minutes we reach that village .
The same peace is spread here as well .
All around from the top of the mountain till the valley is the kingdom of Dhawal Hima .
Within the next five minutes you reach a big round cycle in the middle of that town .
The name of the town is Leukerbad .
Located at a height of 4500 feet from the sea level the population of Lukerabad is around 1500 .
The number of tourists coming here , sportspersons and health workers can be estimated from the fact that there are 1700 members with the capacity of 6900 beds and shells -LRB- Chalets -RRB- 1500 for stay , 28 hotels , camping sites , 90 bed health centers and 50 hotels .
65 sources of hot water have been found in Lukerabad till now .
40 lakh litres -LRB- daily -RRB- hot -LRB- up to 51o C -RRB- water coming out of it is reached on the thermal bridges around 30 small and big bridges made at places in the whole town , some bridges are inside the five starred hotels and others are according to the economic level of the people of different income groups .
On reaching the village one feels a lot of heat .
On the roof of houses in the sun rolling joyfully a large layer of snow is shining .
The name of this village is Albenin -LRB- Albenin -RRB- .
Albenin village is one of the reserved places in Switzerland as a national heritage .
It was said in Darjeeling itself that Sikkim can go only to Sikkim taxi therefore checking does not happen .
The journey is going on , the state is second , but the mountains are the same , the trees are the same , the bright wind is the same .
It is the same wetness that flutters all over the body .
In the season of monsoon the fitting brightness is the same .
The plan of Darjeeling journey was decided to take a glimpse of Karsiang as soon as possible .
Karsiang is a small city of Darjeeling .
Full of tea gardens , full of dust jungles .
Best tea is famous for production .
If we move ahead towards Darjeeling from Siligudi then the tea gardens spread in the beginning welcome those who come towards themselves laughing .
Going through the roads going through tea gardens attracts the heart for the first time .
On one side green mountains full of jungles , on the other side deep green valleys .
Here sometimes jungles and sometimes tea gardens were seen .
There was an empire of greenery all around .
Once I went wrong to see these natural jungles that see the plants of tea planted by humans .
Both were attracting towards themselves .
The beautiful jungles were as beautiful as tea gardens spread far and wide .
If the sight of the road falls on the road then the creation seems amazing .
The circular and circular path of snakes was moving ahead .
Time was also coming .
If it does not end then it is jungle and tea gardens .
Sometimes small settlements were seen .
A mountainous house was seen very dense from far .
It was Karsiang .
Staying here at one place we made a program of roaming throughout the day .
That is why taking a car we left for a tour of Kerseyong .
First of all Deer Park .
A small garden is surrounded by huge jungles all around .
The climb is above i . . to reach Deer Park the train had to be left very down .
Despite being filled with beauty , Kurseyong has not been developed in the form of tourist spots .
While the city is very good and clean .
Despite being deserted the road the joy of reaching the deer park surrounded by jungles and climbing the road through the trees of Dhupi was giving us adventure .
The next place was Eagle Crag .
There is a point located at a height on the other side of this city .
It is also called suicide point .
It is said that during the time of the British lovers used to give life by jumping from here .
At present there is a garden and hotel here .
There is a stair-like dome here on looking at the whole city from the heights of which a beautiful view arises .
In the tea gardens around the women were tired of breaking tea leaves running hands very fast by putting a hat on their backs .
There is a museum outside the city of Kurseyong but on that day we could not go there because touring in the free environment of tea gardens was more important .
The next day touring Darjeeling is certain .
It was a thrilling experience in itself but there was greater concern than this that if such rains keep on happening then how would we roam
But the coincidence was very good that on reaching till the Rock Garden we went on enjoying the soft sunlight .
This park is a very attractive place with stones , waterfalls and wild flowers .
The way to reach here is even more beautiful than this .
On going a little further below from here Ganga Maa surrounded by mountains was found .
The beauty of the waterfalls situated in the middle of the rocks here is worth seeing .
We found in the Rock Garden that the waterfalls in the empire of stones are very beautiful here while the magnificence of waterfalls in Ganga Maa is decorated with stones .
These two places are very low amidst the mountains of Darjeeling .
Rising up with the help of the train we saw the batasia loop in Darjeeling .
The entire mountain and city of Darjeeling can be seen from here on the basis of telescope .
The waves of the weather were clean till now .
But as we went towards the monastery do not know where we came and started sparkling .
In the evening a plan to roam and shopping was made on the mall road .
In the tour of Darjeeling toy trains increase the beauty of the journey .
The journey of toy train from Darjeeling to Ghum and Dhum to Darjeeling is special attraction for tourists .
In the Mirik lakes here boating and luxury in the park .
Tourists also go to Pashupatinath Bazar on this very way , where sweater wrapped by Nepali artisans etc . are found .
There is also arrangement of going to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling district but its form-colour is different .
There is no greenery of tea gardens here but there is abundance of forests and waterfalls .
The most popular tourist spot in Kalimpong is - Leh and Lolegaon , which is full of jungles - waterfalls .
But due to lack of time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to visit Darjeeling in the shadow of winter but the tea gardens spread from Siligudi to Darjeeling kept me tied with us .
A small journey of my present was very attractive and thrilling .
This journey was not of foreign or outside Rajasthan but is very close to Jaipur .
Tourism is an attractive subject in itself in which sometimes the journey attracts towards itself , then sometimes there is a special place , water ship or any city like a royal train or a rose city or Lake Palace of Udaipur .
People get attracted due to some special attraction .
The place where I am going to talk has been prepared just four and a half years ago , but with the preparation that this place has come there he actually welfared the jungle .
Not only for those going there but also for the residents there .
In my ears my guide rotates the words of Rambabu Meena , Sahiba , before this we could not even think that we could stay in the jungle .
Fifty percent staff is in this area .
Suddenly I felt that so many local people did not get work even in Heritage Hotel .
Rambabu resident of Ajabgarh used to work in Jaipur earlier and now in Amman Bagh of this unique royal style .
He brought his speech to a new color .
Sahiba is the estimation of peace garden .
There nobody speaks to you in English telephone .
Aman Bagh is actually a picnic spot with peaceful chain and all comfortable facilities .
The garden also has its history and the biggest thing is that it also introduces itself to the surrounding areas .
In the royal style of Rajasthan how many people have traveled to Bhangarh of the past , some of the residents of Jaipur may have spent the night in that area .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big people of the country and abroad have reached there .
I also remember that night when Shabana had told me there with heart but I could not go .
It is a different thing that he had reached Bhangarh by waiting for himself .
This time suddenly when I reached there my foreign companion then it felt that if people want to spend a good holiday in less time then they should definitely go to Aman Bagh .
This garden is the only garden left of those seven gardens where the king of Alwar used to hunt for hunting .
Its construction was done in one and a half to twenty .
Its old wall is witness to those days .
The first glimpse of Aman Bagh surrounded by mountains and in the shadow of dense trees attracts you .
As you come inside the way you are welcomed , it feels that the attention has been given here on divine peace .
Together with making roots in the organisation , the mantra of Mangalachar is engraved alive .
We had reached after evening and we decided to kill that garden again .
My host Jackie , who is a decorative , has said easily , is attractive .
All the havelis and palaces are inspired .
The most beautiful is their lighting .
Everything is new but artistic . It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has also got the awards at present .
The manager decided our program for the morning .
First of all walked with Ram Babu and then the jeep journey of Bhangarh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgarh on which gradually the sun rays were spreading .
The dry lake was seen in which the farmers were doing farming .
This year there was no rain but for the first time we saw the farming of tobacco .
For Jackie such a glimpse of rural life was a unique experience .
After that we reached Bhangarh by jeep .
Just in the morning I saw a tourist from Holland sitting in mind .
These are invaluable moments of millions of dollars .
The way to supplement the peaceful garden was also traditional and by giving jaggery and curd they gave us relief .
Now we came to know why tourists come here spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are kept to see the life of the species .
Is this right
Undoubtedly and not only this happens in many states and tourists also show special interest in it .
This tour is generally prepared for a period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken at different places .
It also includes staying there , food etc .
This way an attempt is made to discover such places where there was not much development and there was no special effect of time on nature and lifestyle of people .
At that place only old tourist spots etc . are also present .
Besides this , even after all the traditional cooking attention is given .
Actually the purpose of such a tour was to introduce tourists with the methods and traditions of living in that place .
Although this idea looks a little difficult , but such tours are really attractive and give a different kind of experience .
Just tour has its own joy .
You can enjoy roaming alone despite being with many people .
Not only this in this journey you can give more time without obstructing your favorite book .
Yes , it is very important that along with giving less expenditure and excessive time these tours definitely keep the hope of patience from you .
This is the reason that it is important to keep in mind some things for enjoying them , especially when you are watching a foreign destination with the help of bus tour .
Find Best Deal before taking ticket .
Students , senior people of the military , children etc . get a suit on them , then there is also arrangement of giving suits to two people .
However , shopping of accommodation tickets is cheap , therefore in the last minute it is better to plan a little quicker than making a tour plan .
Instead of tower ticket get information about round trips .
They fall cheap .
Rules regarding bags are special , therefore consider the shape and weight of the goods .
Never be such that you will have to leave some things on terminal or you will have to pay more fees .
Along with this also know the rules of insurance or loss compensation from the tour company .
Carrie on bags are right , take it .
Because they sit together in the rock on these seats .
Keep in mind this thing as well that while changing the bus during tour the responsibility of the goods is yourself .
From where you have to take a bus , reach there an hour before time .
During the busy season you should pay special attention to this thing .
Actually as soon as you reach , you will have the best set options .
Keep in mind whether it is comfortable while selecting the seat .
If there are more seats on the back seat , then there is no conferencing to read on the following seats .
If you have to go to the toilet continuously , then take a seat on the elbow and if you do not like much obstruction then the window seat will be good for you .
Now one-fourth thing .
If you are in the desire of both the bullocks then first sit on the elbow seat and keep your bag on the other seat .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the plan will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus , then while selecting the seat also keep in mind this thing because it becomes difficult to sit there after a while .
Identify with bus driver and conductor .
So you will get very important information from them .
During the cleanliness of the bus everyone is told to go out .
During this do not leave your luggage on the stairs because they do not take the responsibility of losing them .
Where to stay , return on time .
If you do not come on time then your place can be found to another person and you will have to wait for the bus .

On the roads of Goa , cycling , river cruise , cold sea wind and enjoying the enjoyment of world famous gooseberry , to spend comfortable days , injar Hotel situated here is an excellent option .
On seeing today 's date the fare of returning from Delhi to the cheapest person is 28 thousand rupees .
After that if you stay in Male then also you can get hotels at a little rent but if you go to any island around to enjoy the real beauty of Maldives then it will be smaller .
C cruise proves to be beneficial .
In the first week of December Lui cruise from Kochi started India 's only C cruise for Maldives and Colombo .
Louis cruise is a European company and is very famous in cruise and hotel business .
Although due to some problems Louis Cruise has now postponed its service , but there is a possibility of its resumption from October .
You can go to Maldives for a trip of three days at the rate of at least Rs . 5850 per person on the ship of Lui cruise MV Equamarine .
That is , for three days the fare of one person is less than 18 thousand rupees .
And if there are two elders then for children below the age of 15 years completely free .
What else should you do .
Tea - breakfast , food are included in the rent of cruise .
With the entertainment of every time .
On reaching Rajdhani Male you can enjoy the entertainment , movement available in Maldives with the help of your sweet lunch - from C plane ride to Andarwat lunch .
If you are standing in front of you suddenly while roaming in big airplanes then you will feel like playing .
But this 12 - 15-seat-seat TV Ooty aircraft is undisputedly excellent for the tour of Maldivesarkhand Island .
He does not even know that while running like a speed boat from the surface of water he ever flys in the air .
In the entire journey we do not feel the journey of normal aircraft .
Your eyes keep roaming down from the window keeping in mind the various shadowed blue water of Maldives , reservoir islands and flowing islands .
How clean is everything .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldives is one of these companies with 20 aircraft .
If you want you can travel in air for about 4 thousand rupees -LRB- each -RRB- or you can take the entire aircraft on rent throughout the day -LRB- only filled -RRB- .
Although if we go from Male Island to any other island then the journey of sea plane is important because this is the only way to travel on different islands .
And this is such a journey which we do not want to finish .
Sea aircraft travels from 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- in the north Mavilewaru -RRB- to Maldives .
We were in the largest ancient and sovenier shops of the capital in the Ahmedabad market of Male .
All the sellers of Maldives President Mohammad Nashid had listened carefully to the speeches given in the World Climate Conference of Copenhagen a day before .
I have not seen any Indian listening so carefully to the speech of the President or the Prime Minister.
But when the question of the existence of a miraculous object came on this earth then so seriousness was so bold .
Many people may have understood the meeting taken by the cabinet of Maldives in October even if they have come to Maldives then it seems as if the anger of nature has snatched it out of itself then the world will be driven .
There is something special in the beauty there .
The beauty of that small country is not so much .
While going back to the cruise on that journey of the market if your eyes go back to the sea water then it seems as if the people here do so much of beauty .
The water was so clean that the fish swimming on the depths below the lamppost looks with all their colors .
This was that part of the sea which is completely connected to the city .
If we can clearly see some centimetre in the sea or water of the river near any city of India then you will consider yourself fortunate .
While returning from MV Equamrin two hours of the evening spent in Male was enjoying the heart .
Traveller stone -LRB- pearl stone -RRB- is the life here .
Not only this , you will also find mung stones on the stones of the grave .
After listening to President Nashid 's speech we were standing outside his official residence for some time .
It does not really seem that we are standing outside the residence of one of the highest handicrafts of the country and there is no protector at all .
We were enjoying photographs of only 50 metres long garden and wildlife by handing inside the door of their bungalow .
Can we think about the house of a leader in India
It also came to know that sometimes the President reached his office ahead of two houses by walking on foot .
Everything in the context of Maldives was encouraging .
That is why I was waiting for the next day hungryly .
It seems that that day was going to be special .
In the morning a name from Cruise brought us to the airport island .
From there we rotated the runway on the base of Trans Maldives .
Last evening when the cruise reached near Male then we immediately knew the plane going from above .
They had seen so many photographs .
But then there was no imagination that the next day there would be a chance to roam out of it .
We had to go to Rangali Island 150 kilometres long by the sea plane of Trace Maldives .
The sea plane flying at a height of approximately thousand metres is unforgettable to see hundreds of resorts and flower islands spread on the sea of Maldives .
Such beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
There is a flight to stop breathing with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Konarad resort of Hillton Hotel on Rangali Island it felt as if we have reached a different world .
In such a world which has no relation with any outside world .
There was no such relation that it was not possible to get rid of the beauty and comfort like there .
The journey of Konard can also be done on foot or by battery train .
The view of water on both the sides of the bridge going from the port to the main island is unique .
Now we could not separate ourselves from the nature of the surroundings then we reached such a place which was unimaginable .
While descending down from the stairs to several metres below the sea we went to such a room of glass which was in water .
Our room was always a dining room .
On crossing the glass we could see a unique type of small and big fish , spring , snorkelling and scuba diving people .
There the imagination of eating sitting on tables was very thrilling .
The cost of one person to come and see this island from Male and take lunch inside the water is Rs . 47 thousand .
There was no desire to return from there .
We were ready to leave our passports in water .
But it was known that this is not possible .
Heavy mind returned with this hope that sometimes the destiny will come back to this place .
It was decided to go far from Delhi for many days but because of the busyness of work it was not possible .
Wildlife was interested in childhood then thought that why do not Jim Corbett visit this time .
This was the second bike journey after biking till Pegong pond near Khardungla in 2006 .
At 27 o'clock in the afternoon we left for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the excitement that we were going out was bursting with the wind .
The journey between Hapur and Gajraula was really tiring .
Smoke from above and bad roads in front .
Sometimes we felt that we fell now .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 o'clock in the morning .
However we reached Ramnagar at 12 o'clock .
Corbett Park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was descending near the park which we had already registered .
On that day we did not have any special program but despite winters we went to tour the beach of Kosi first .
After spending two - three hours there we went out to see the Corbett Museum situated near Dhangdi Gate at a distance of 2 kilometres .
From there we went out to visit Ramnagar below .
It took a lot of evening while returning .
While coming out of Delhi I decided that the lion walking openly in the jungle would definitely see that I was seen only lions throughout the night .
I suddenly heard in the darkness of the night and after that the dogs started sneezing like that which did not stop for two hours .
Initially Kaldungi and Corbett waterfalls were worth seeing .
Kalatungi is thirty kilometres long while Corbett Fall is on the way .
There is a museum of Jim Corbett Saheb in Kalatungi where some important things related to his personal life have been kept .
Till the return 12 .
Kalatungi is a very beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this village itself .
On reaching the resort the safari jeeps were waiting for us .
It was told that they have arranged for siteing in a number of night bisranis there .
When asked about one number we told that there is more greenery and tigers come to the same place to prevent winters .
On reaching Bijrani we were given a guide which takes two and a half hundred rupees to travel for four hours .
We left for the jungle inside .
We saw many species of animals and deer there .
We saw two tiny elephants inside whose long teeth were .
I did a lot of photography .
During this the guide started trekking the tiger .
The guide told that there are about 150 tigers in the park , some of which have died .
At some places we also saw the symptoms of their claws but I was disappointed because of not seeing the tiger .
On the third day we had to return to Delhi .
I was filled with a lion ' s bed in my head .
Then I remembered a friend of Haldani .
I put a similar phone on him .
I told him that I have come to the carbonate .
He asked if the tiger saw or not .
The words of that should be put like pearls .
I spoke slowly , no .
There was no permission to take bike in the park .
Someone told us that you take a ride to go inside .
