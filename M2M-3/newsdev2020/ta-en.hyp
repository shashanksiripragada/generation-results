Bosnians protest against the Kroshian nuclear plant project
Hundreds of people flew to Bosnia on Friday in the north-western Bosnia, protesting against Bosnia's neighbouring Korrosia, a part of the waste from the only nuclear reactor in the region, near the well-known river for its border and natural beauty with Bosnia.
Demonstrators in Bosnia Town Novigrade insisted on abandoning the plans for savings in the old military dwellings in Tkoska Kora and committed to fighting the plan.
The waste of the Krusco nuclear reactor will be placed at that place.
Bosnians, who came with the texts of 'Healthy Future' and 'Stand-Una River Needs', would supplement the atomic waste and pose a threat to 250,000 people living in the region, he added.
Don't say that.
This was stated by Miroslav Dyerelzaga, President of the Novie Great Municipal Corporation.
We must fight to protect our lifestyle and our minds.
The 1980s factory located in Slovenia belongs to Kroshia.
Officials of the two countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage.
Kroshia's national HRD television announced on Friday that Kroshia has not yet decided whether it will provide its own savings facilities or pay a fee in the Slovenia-making reserves.
Kroshia has a problem in eliminating institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and is trying to solve a wholesale solution, the Minister for Environmental Protection and Energy, Tomislav Gorik told the broadcaster.
Activists, officials and residents from all parts of Bosnia of different species urged all of them to examine another part near the nuclear factory.
Dyrelzaga questioned why all parts of Kurosia were left and chosen to be the part of Bosnia, Tkoska Kora.

Nigeria: Police examines Katuna School, expells 300 children
Imamo Ahmad bin Hambal, a school in Lein Maiduban Suma, located in Rikasa, the Ikabi local territory of Katuna, was tested by state police officers in Katuna.
The police accused the children of being in an unmanned environment, which was denied by the school.
One of the teachers in the school introduced himself as Sehu said: 'They are not true to say that children are all here with the consent of their parents.
The parents signed a stage before the children were admitted to the school.
Parents are routine to bring food to their children every day and they are also aware of the situation they have.
We were surprising when the police came and removed the children before the school was closed and removed the food for the children brought by the parents of the children.
This is unjust because we have parents to testify whether their children were in a bad condition as police say.
He said that the earlier police commissioner, Abdur Raghuman, had not told any complaint when he came to school to see how children are being taken care of.
Children did not read anything other than Kuran.
However, when the police communication officer Yakub Sabo said that the children will be brought back to their parents after being handed over to the state government.
They have been kept in an unmanned environment in the name of uran teaching.
Many of them have spots on their backs show that they have fallen.
Therefore, we are asking at school to know who is the owner of the school.

His father and director, S.A. Chandrasekhar, said that if Vijay only has so much opposition, he is growing.
The audio release of the film 'Bigil' took place in Chennai recently.
Vijay said, "The lorry drivers are blaming the drivers and those who are scared off in the case of Subhasree who died in a road accident," and said, "Where you want to put them there, it would be better if you keep them there."
Vijay's speech is being strongly condemned on behalf of the superior side.
At the same time, Kamalhasan, leader of the People's Justice, has supported Vijay's speech.
In this context, Vijay's father, S. A. Chandrasekhar, had arrived at the airport from Chennai today to attend a function at Nagar Temple in Kanyakumari district.
There the reporters presented questions about the criticisms being faced by Vijay.
In response, he replied: Subhasree died in an accident when he was on a bike on the road.
Everyone is talking about this incident.
Vijay spoke about one thing that everyone speaks.
The court has asked the question why not arrest those involved in Subashree's case yet.
But Vijay did not know why ministers and dignitaries were protesting.
It means that Vijay has so much opposition that he is growing.
If you talk, will there be so much opposition, wouldn't you
If Vijay speaks, it means he is growing.
In view of Vijay's platform discussions, the reporters asked if he was sure to come to politics.
'I don't know anything like this,' said SA Chandrasekhar.
We asked the surgeons about this.
They said, 'There is no alternative to say that the sacrifice of Supsree Penner is unfortunate.
But why did Vijay and Biggil wait for the release of the film's music
The fan with a cutout for a film starring Vijay, fell down and fell down.
That video also runs.
But he must have said that he should not have a cutout for his films.'
A news has been spreading in Wattsup for the past few days on the title 'The need for warning to dogs.'
Immediately the children were asked to inform the parents if they bite the dog or their nails were slaughtered.
Without telling the parents that the rabis virus had caused more than 90 percent damage to a child because he did not tell the dog bite.
The young man who is being treated at the hospital is on a video show like a dog.
We asked Ananthapadmanathan, a cattle doctor, whether the bitten people would walk like a navel, whether the information spreading in the Wattsup is true.
If the rabis virus bites the dog, the virus will certainly affect the bitten people.
But if the nails of the nail are dry on the body, the rabis will not spread.
Perhaps if the nails of the dog suffering from rabis are spread in the place where the nails are covered then the disease can spread.
Disease spreads even if the bitten's body gets wounded and wounded, the dog hit by rabis in that place.
Therefore, it is better to put Rapis vaccines in the home as a precaution for dog-building.
Animal physicians also get vaccines once a year because they have to be treated for dogs.

Boris Police Monitoring Organisation recommends Friendship with Women Entrepreneur Genefer Arkuriya
At the time of London's Mayor, the independent office of the police will now assess whether the prime minister should be prosecuted for a criminal offense in government office.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) Monitoring Officer has registered a "Conditional Matters" on the charge of prioritising Ms.
It said that when there is information that a criminal offense might have happened, it is a matter of activity.
It does not mean that it has been proved in any way.
The IOPC will now examine whether the matter should be investigated.
It is now recommended to the IOPC dealing with complaints against police in UK and Wells.
At that time, it was recommended to the Monitoring Organisation as Shri Janson was in comparison to the Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Mr. Janson has denied that there was no mistake about his friendship with Ms. Arkuriya.
He stressed that they have blamed him, but he said that he is admired by the London Legislative Assembly to give details of his relations with Ms. Arkuriya.
Seven years ago, Ms. Arkuri, immigrant US to London, was granted 126,000 from public funds, and Mr. Janson was the Mayor, after the Sunday Times report that he was allowed on concessional basis in three foreign trips led by him.
After that, the government has stopped under the revision of the decision to give Ms. Arkuri's company, Hacker House.
It faces these questions regarding the pre-delivery assessment processes of money delivery.
Digital Minister Mat Worman said that his department has taken a "specific normal practice" and the company had a UK phone number.

Prime Minister's friendship with a woman businessman is the secret of all businessmen
GLA's action recommending the Prime Minister to the Freedom Office of the Police Act has inflicted anger on the number 10.
This is a 'politically motivated attack' and the Conservative Party convention will be held at the time of which a senior government reported that it was 'Opportant Political'.
"No evidence has been given by the observer regarding any accusations and no opportunity has been given to the Prime Minister to respond to the observer before a report will be issued on Friday night."
The public and the media will know that it was obviously engraved with a political perspective.
With the help of the London Tourism Development Agency, Mr. Janson's close contact with the California businessman was described as 'All Knowledge Secret' in the past today.
Ms. Arkuri recalled how Ms. Arkuri was placed in his foreign business visits led by Mr. Janson when he was the Mayor of London Partners (LP) Agencies and Ms.
In the death of McMiller, one was accused of taking intoxicants.
Las Angeles (AP) - Last year, a third person was arrested and charged with drug addiction in connection with the death of Ripper McMiller.
In September last year, court records show that Stephen Walter is suspected of selling fake oxycoton tablets in Fantan, which Miller had possessed, before the death of Cocaine, alcohol and thousands of lives due to the destruction of the disease.
Walter has been accused of selling pills to another person named Cameron Pettit.
Court documents published on Tuesday reported that Pettit drugs were obtained from Walter from August.
Earlier this week, Ryan Revis, who was arrested in Arisona's Lake Hawasu City, has been accused of acting as a "Runner" who brought pills to the coach.
None of them have been directly charged with Miller's death, and no one has made an appeal.
Walter, who was released under the supervision of a drug case in 2005, has already been ordered to take five months in jail for breaching the conditions of his liberty.
On Thursday, a well-known portal, DMEST, first prosecuting the case, advocates have said that Walter should remain in jail for the time of trial, as the possibility of escaping abroad.
The phone report sent to his lawyer has not been given any notice immediately.
On September 4, Pettit was accused in the Federal Court and his lawyer refused to comment.
Miller's response has an open discussion on his stress and use of drugs, which has obtained some of the greatest people in the hip-hap as fans.
Malcolm James Myris McCarmik, a singer of Pittsburg, who was in touch with Haryana Grand for two years, ended in the beginning of 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a lovely video about him on his Instagram and published a song "Thank you Next", which was very closely mentioned about him.
Miller's death is also one of the deaths of music artists associated with Opioid use in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a Kidar artist in the 3 Dorse Town team, died in 2016, with Fentan and Hydrocodon in his body.
The article has been amended to demonstrate Walter's first letters not Steven as Stephen.
The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that the people suffering from dengue fever are sufficient to take 650 grams of Parasitamal pill and do not need to take it bigger.
This carelessness of the Chief Minister has made a big debate in the state.
More than a thousand people in Uttarakhand have been treated with dengue fever so far.
The opposition parties, including the Congress, are accusing the government of not taking proper precautionary measures.
In such a situation, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand said that the impact was low due to adequate surveillance measures taken by the Government and asked for the benefit of those who were treated in government hospitals with dengue.
It is a matter of discussion that if he had come and asked for welfare, he would not have been uncomfortable.
He said that the fever of dengue will flee while taking 650 grams of Parasitamal pill in return for 500 grams of Parasitamal pill.
He has spoken like this while the health department officials have said that those suffering from dengue fever should not take pills on their own without taking medicines for regular treatment.
The same Chief Minister had said that in the last few months, when the air from the cow was blown up, the breathing problem would be correct.

Former President of the North Carolina Republican Party is going to acknowledge the crime for lying in a lunch trial.
The court documents filed on Friday indicate that Karolina would agree to the former Republican President's court that he lied to Federal officials who conducted a lunch inquiry into the key political donor.
The Federal Court appeals that Rabin Hayes is going to accept the crime next Wednesday.
Hayes was told that he had told the FBI agents who had conducted a lunch trial in 2018 in a document based on the fact that Hayes' lawyer signed as part of the Criminal Approval Agreement.
The Criminal Approval Agreement has been printed and did not really mention what charges he agrees.
He was initially charged with the allegations of satisfaction, lending and informing negligent information.
The principal insurance regulatory system of the state had donated the election campaign and reflected the special concession of the insurance officer's plan to blame the lawyers on the contact of former parliamentarian Hayes.
The officer, Crack Lindberg and his colleagues, were accused of trying to penalize State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kasse.
Lindberg is an Insurance and Investment Institute, who has been one of the leading political donors of the state in recent years, and has donated more than 5 million to state and federal candidates since 2016.
Though he worked on Republican policies and its politicians, he donated to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to the e-mail sent on Friday.
Karnes Davis, a lawyer for Hayes, did not respond to the e-mail sent for further comments on Friday.
The court documents filed on Friday reported that Hayes lied to the FPI agents in August 2018 that he never spoke to Kasse about the worker in the State Insurance sector.
But Hayes actually spoke to the insurance commissioner about Lindburg's demand to change the workers within the regulatory agency.
Prosecutors said Hayes helped Lindburg to meet Kasse and had directly consulted the Rehuller about the liquidity.
Accusations published in April accused Lindberg of seeking special concessions for his insurance industry and up to 2 million for Kasse's re-election campaign in 2020.
It also accuses Lyndburg's company of seeking to change the departmental officer.
Casey Federal, a Republican member of the Republican Party, told the intelligence officials about trying to give a penalties and helped them to prosecute the case.
There is no charge against him.
During a conversation with Lindberg and Kasey, a Lindberg ally told Hayes to send 250,000 to Case's re-election campaign.
Heis initially denied that it would be taken care of if sending such a large amount, but at the end of the conversation, it was alleged.
Heys accuses all of you of doing what you want.
Well, I would like him to do this.
The Information Officer for the Federal Prosecutor's Office has not responded to further information about the Criminal Approval Agreement.
Face to hide the number of desires as a test attempt to improve the well-being of beneficiaries
Some face-to-face beneficiaries cannot see the desires, responses and video conferencing as the world's first testing attempt to improve the well-being of the beneficiaries.
On the contrary, these wishes will be individual and only those who have been recorded after such a test conducted by Instagram in Australia in July.
The experiment will be started by Australia, Mohnul, which will start on Friday.
Mya Carlick, Director of the Australian Federal Policy, said that this change is based on the views of psychologists that wealth research and desires are comparatively comparative to each other in the society.
Carlick said, "The anti-corruption groups and psychological institutions working with us have really received positive ideas."
This is to address the significance of the number and in response to the sympathy of desires or reactions, people are focusing on the quality of their interference and the quality of their registrations.
He said that it is expected that people will feel more pleasant to share this platform without being considered as a competition.
Carlic promised that Mughal-based industries would continue to achieve the same measure as before and the same perspective they had already approached.
He said that the test will be conducted in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland in other countries.
In Instagram's owner, Mughal, it has nothing to point out when this test can be done or whether this change will be made permanent.
He said, "In Instagram, we have got some initial ideas from the public, but in this situation we are still learning and conscious."
Observing that it is a world experiment, Carlick said that Australia has a very active technologically beneficiaries in Mughal England and Instagram.
We believe that this will be the best country to get best ideas about whether it is a valuable experience for the people using our services or not.

This is the moment that our ancestors are coming to the earth completely.
During Tarpana, sesame water, pind, rice, banana and food will be used.
The scripture says that the gods of Pithar will bring them to the forefathers.
The ancestors who came to see their children in the world again came back to Piturlok today.
These days, bathing on the shores of the pilgrimage, guiding them by worshiping Pitur, the family will live prosperously and save livelihood.

The Chennai High Court asked the Government of Tamil Nadu to ask why they should not get separate reservation in government medical colleges.
In Tamil Nadu, 207 seats have not been filled up in private medical colleges for Overseas Indians, they have been provided to the colleges relating to administrative adjudication sites.
Tiran from Goa, who was required to fill these places with a regular consultation, had prosecuted a case in the Chennai High Court.
The case came to the trial at a session of Judges Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
P. Raman, Minister of State for Medical Council of India, argued that after the three-phase consultation, the list will be sent to the respective colleges on the basis of 10 students at one place if the seats are vacant for overseas Indians.
The list should be filled in the under-services of the laws of the college.
But I don't know if the list was filled in the bottom of the list.
On behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu, Additional Chief Justice Aurobindo Thiruvananthapuram argued that the list of blank spots will be sent to the respective colleges of Matt Dume.
The merit is to fill the empty spaces.
But I don't know how colleges are filling up.
The Supreme Court has not issued any order in this regard.
Therefore, he argued that this Judicial Rahman should give a proper order to fill up reservations for Indian diaspora.
On the petitioner's side, the prosecutor Velmurugan argued that 207 seats in the vacancies were sold to the lowest numbers.
Why should the interfered judges, those who go to private schools for schooling and ask for government medical colleges only for medical education, why should they not provide separate reservations to the government medical colleges and send lists related to blankets only on what basis is the filling up
Here the government doctors are given less than teachers, because they are given lesser wages than my helpers.
We consider it to be an injustice to the doctors.
We are directing 10 different medical colleges in Tamil Nadu to be opponents in this case.
The students who have been accumulated in reservations for Overseas Indians have directed the colleges to submit their assessments as a report by October 15.
Pakistan's social media renowned Guantil Baloch's life sentence for brothers in Gaurav Killing
Guanteeel Baloch, famous for his social media photographs, was killed in July 2016.
Last Friday, Pakistan's social media renowned Guinda was blamed for killing his brothers and sentenced to life imprisonment in a high-level 'Gauravak murder' in the country of Anathika.
Famous for his attractive selfies in Pakistan, which was attracted by western civilization, but deeply hated by women, Baloch was killed and necked in July.
His brother Mohammad Washim was arrested.
In a press conference a few days later, he said that he was not sorry about what he did, and yes, I had killed my sister and the behavior of sister was very provocative.
In a long-awaited judgment, his lawyer Sardar Mohammed AFP said that the court in the eastern city of Multan proved to be a crime against his parties and sentenced to life imprisonment.
He will be released in the High Court of Justice in Asia of Gaul.
Earlier, the AFP said that Baloch's mother Anwar Mi would be released to her son.
"He's father.
She is my daughter, she is my son.
The killing of Baloch internationally began to repeat the voices of taking action against the infectious disease of 'Gauravat murder', which is usually being killed, to violate the social regulations of the analytic society.
Women have been burnt, burnt, burnt, buried, buried and necked to make their family hurt by crimes such as selecting their husband or slaughtering their own husband.
The killings are usually done by one close relatives.
They may apologize to the relatives of the victims under Pakistan's uisas (Prison Money) and the Dayat (Prison) Act.
Three months after the killing of Baloch, the Parliament enacted a new legislation by compulsory life imprisonment for prideful murders.
However, the judge's self-decision that if a murder is considered to be a proud murder, it will lead to other reasons for the murder of the killers and obtain forgiveness.
In the murder of Baloch, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But they said that we will lose their son and they should change their minds and forgive him.
However, due to international disgust over the murder, the Pakistani government took a unique step to declare itself a legacy with parents and made progress in this case.
The fatigue for the Pakistan cricket team and the fascinating scarlet on lover's day are some of the works of all known Baloch.
This led to his criticisms and threats, but demonstrating themselves as symptoms like Kim Cordasian, in a country where they were adventurous and political activity for women's empowerment, including young people.
The roots of 'Kaurava' murder are in tribal social controls, which are widely widespread across South Asia, and men may be affected, but they insist on women's behavior.
Today we have lost the ground water a little bit.
Now we have started feeling the need for banyan trees.
For this, the banana seed festival of Tamil Nadu is now famous by social enthusiasts and youth.
It has been actively functioning since 2015 and the 'Prabhakaran Revolution Seeds Movement' at Annavasal.
The Organisation is a member of several districts of Tamil Nadu, namely Thiruchchi, Thiruchchi, Thiruchchi, Thiruchchi and Thiruvananthapuram.
Everyone is studying and working in different works.
Yet the youngsters of this organisation are enthusiasticly engaged in various works such as tree plantation, water conservation, preservation and restoration of ancient historical sites.
Gaja is collecting seeds of palm seeds in relief operations and sowing them in many places in Tamil Nadu and providing free of cost to the needy.
I am familiar with the youth who integrate Prabhakaran Revolution Seeds Movement.
Edison, one of them, shared with me about their work.
West Bengal elephant who died gracefully
Speaking on this, animal interests said, 'In 2004, it was transformed into a broad gauge.
After that, more trains are being run on this route.
Elephants' lives have also increased since the increase in the number of trains.
This area is the pathway of elephants.
Railways have taken into consideration that due to the speed of trains being run in the area, elephants have died due to the accident.
After that, the trains were ordered to run at a low pace in the region.
Due to this, the accidents were also reduced.
Now the trains in the region are running at a rapid pace.
We are demanding to set up penalties in other parts.'
Speaking on the occasion, North Eastern Regional Railway officials said, "There is 15 km of railway line in the forest.
While crossing this area, trains have been ordered to run slowly.
The order to run the trains for 24 hours is in force.
Continuous research is underway in the forest area.
Consultations are also going on to reduce the speed of trains.'
A three-member team has been set up to review the operation of trains in the region.
The accident area was 4.5 degrees circular.
Loco Filt, who directed the train, is getting treatment.
Social enthusiastics said that in Tamil Nadu, the mahaprayag has been stopped for the last one year without providing the mahaprayag subsidy to the kurbans.
Dr. Muthu Lakshmi Reddy Maternal Assistance Programme was launched to benefit the poor pregnant women from the Department of Public Welfare and Family Welfare in the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Within 12 weeks of pregnancy, the details of Aadhaar card, bank account number etc. are given to the rural and urban serving persons, and after registering the name of Maternity Financial Assistance Scheme, Rs.
After the completion of the 4th month, 4,000 will be provided in the second penny.
A total of 18,000 subsidies will be provided at 3rd pregnancy at the Government Hospital, 4th pregnancy to children and 2,000 rupees after completion of 9 months of pregnancy.
Similarly, nutritious substances including iron tonic, wooller berry, protein biscuits, ghee, alpentasol pills, cucumber pieces are provided to improve the physical capacity of women during pregnancy.
The scheme has been implemented to ensure that pregnant women get their children healthy.
This scheme was very beneficial for middle and poor pregnant women.
Over the last one year, the reproductive supplies to the pregnant women have been stopped without regular delivery.
In this regard, social interests said, 'The 18,000 maternal aid provided by the Department of Public Welfare and Family Welfare to pregnant women has not been given for more than 13 months.
This has affected the safety of mother and child during maternal reproduction.
There has been a situation of buying loans for child care.
Since only nutritional plants have been provided, the subsidies have not been deposited in the bank account till date.
In this regard, in the matter of questioning the Health Department officials, the amount for the first submission to the Central Government has not yet been given.
It is said that after paying the first grant of Rs. 2,000, the remaining amount of Rs. 16,000 will be deposited in the bank account.
However, it is questionable that the Tamil Nadu government has registered the applications of pregnant women seeking maternal aid.
Therefore, the government has to take a proceeding ticket to immediately provide unsupplied maternal assistance for more than a year.'

A new inquiry date has been set for a man from Guatamala, accused of killing a woman from Ayodhya and her two children.
According to the documents, the Bog County District Court has been charged in three categories of planned murder of 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Arlana, who initially killed Marvin Escopher-Lopus, in a fake name to the police personnel.

He was punished in 2010 for entering the US into law.
Ministers insurgency against Paris Johnson's Agreement with Brussels to Reduce Braxid Demands
With only three weeks for the multiple summit of European leaders, fear is increasing among the top officials around the Prime Minister that the time for achieving major concessions is decreasing.
Ministers insurgently oppose Boris Johnson for a compromise agreement with the European Union by reducing his frequency demands.
While Brussels said that Mr. Janson's alternative arrangements are incomplete, there has been a stir in the discussion on a new customs system in exchange for Irish Baxtop.
Besides Germany's Enzla Merkel-led European Union Power Proccours, senior ministers will present the last time agreement on Bextop to the Tori leader who is ready to fight.
The three different cabinet ministers, who spoke to The Sun, are preparing to oppose him after the annual conference of the Tori parties to be held in Manchester next week.
With the threat of no agreement, the senior assistant Dominique Commings, along with the European Union, will call for him to abandon the planned 'proof' strategy and insist on accepting the last time concession of the European Union.
One minister said that the Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday to finish the adjournment of the Parliament was "Time to awaken" and said: "The only way to now make an agreement for October 31.
We can never get the number at the bottom, and they are against us.
Now the Prime Minister has to be curtailed and taken that he can get.
The communication plan has clearly emerged, not being foolish.
We can't fight everywhere.
The second Cabinet Minister has promised Shri Janshan to try to implement the Agreement of former Prime Minister Teresa May if everything else is created.
The senior minister further said: "If the matter is taken, I will tell Boris to present the Teresa Agreement undermine."
Now it has enough numbers, everybody is trying to finish it.
If we were insisted to sustain this, everything was possible for Boris and everything was possible for all of us.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not giving importance to the negotiations.
In a glittering speech, the former Tory leader said: "The Prime Minister wants us to make an agreement with Europe.
But we couldn't see Brussels setting up an agreement.
On the contrary, we see in Scotland rubbing with bullocks, examining eggs in Wells and voting with the people on the streets - an election campaign is already going on as if all the world feels.'
The Prime Minister's communicator acknowledged that no one should imagine, we have to go a long way to reach the agreement," the Prime Minister acknowledged.
In Brussels, the Pen Act, which enforces a three-month delay when there is no agreement, was said, "There is a rapid reduction in our negotiations".
There is no doubt that it prevents our dialogue, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are constantly trying to progress because of that legislation, he added.
Frexit Secretary Stephen Parkley is going back to Brussels today to further negotiate with the European Union's Michael Persian.
They will suggest a document on how all the Irelands are possible for food and livestock.

Lorein Kelly: I was told that I can never enter the television with the Clasco supremeity.
The television owners have told him that because of his Clasco supremacy, he has said that he can never be a programme collector.

I was very painted when I was 25 years old, he said.
I worked as a researcher in BBC Scotland and said my employer would never enter the television because of my Clasco supremacy.
Before I took charge at the Clasco office, I went to London to see all the television teams and broadcast the program.
In the morning, I will never forget that both On Timont and Mike Morris were interviewing the famous Beat Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room where there was a very popular person.
I realized that this is the place I like to stay.
Kelly started his life as a local journalist in East Gilbrid in Scotland, a Scotland reporter of AM television in 1997.
He started distributing programmes such as GMTV, IDV Brackfast and Tabrek, and then inaugurated the morning programme of Laurine, which was named after him.

One of those mothers who beat her five-year-old daughter Johnna, Bam Rose personally asked me to meet and we spoke in that meeting in his house for hours.
I went to Johnna's final body to continue our relationship, since then, snakes and I continue to be friends.
Immediately after his daughter lost in 2007, he interacted with Gate and Kerry McCain, who gave a supreme difficulty and really appreciated his compassion and courage.
There was an unknowing pain that their fascinating daughter had to bear, and the ideas that were wounded on the online.
I'm sorry for them.

imbabwe: Shivinga is scared of getting stuck
A senior government official feared that former President Robert Mugabe denied the opportunity to be president at the time of the revolutionary height, and said that it could be an instrument to empower the army to seize the regime in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe Independent told imbabwe that he and the army had negotiated during the revolution to take over as presidential.
A senior government official told the social media, however, that he had not denied this opportunity by fear of ivenga, and was able to understand the plan of the camp to prove to the world leaders and the leaders of the African Union (AU) that he actually lost his position in the revolution.
imbabwe's 37-year-old ruler was willing to hand over power to imbabwe, but amwanda 2 confirmed by government officials as a senior government official of the presidential office and cabinet office that President Emerson Nangakwa would not have.
Government officials said Mugabe had reached ivenga by one of his embassies to understand power from his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three persons in arbitration between the head of the military bureaucracy and the disappearing former Chancellor.
The officials said that the negotiators would include President's spokesman George Saramba, Aaron Nebera, the then chairman of the Central Intelligence Organization, and the Roman philosopher, Fisch Cleric Fidalis Mokonori.
He was another person in the interaction after the imbabwe Reserve Bank's former Governor Jidian Gono Mugabe was sent separately to imbabwe Defence Force (ESTF) to give presidential chance to ivenga.
He was described as Africa's identity after death from a living time and sought the intervention of other African leaders, while attempting to waste the African Union to recognise the operation of the military.
The contemporary (Mukabe) then CDF (General of Defence Forces) did not select him as presidential.
The official (Jamwanda) wrote, 'It was an unbelievable attempt to rectify the rapidly emerging climate and tired part of the late presidential family,' he said.
But there was a little political ambition, which would at least correct the situation in the diplomatic system, the former president believed.
Recalling the commanders' promise not to disrupt or disrupt the constitutional order, this change would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union on revolutions.
The former president (Mukabe) believed that the words of the commanders would be confirmed that the then CDF (Sivenga) would suppress the collapse of the Constitution.
Looking at the whole situation, the African Union, which was very confused to take it on the basis of its theoretical nature of revolutions, would have said it would have been unrevolutionary and would have believed that military intervention was needed.
This opportunity has been given by calculating.
Officials said that the camp had taken this action when the security forces were not ready to defend themselves.
They said the camp was insisted on writing a resignation letter because the army warned him that he was in danger of being killed like Kadabi.
Military CEOs told him that if citizens marched to his flu form residence, we would not protect him from them.
At that time, he had two desires to protect his family and prove the army's capture of rule,' the official said.
The then CDF and commanders (they) understood the idea properly.
The senior government official said that the unbelievable consulate (Gono) was told by a powerful sympathy - Visu Tiri Vemakwapa-Makwapa (who we haven't shown anyone, i.e., the military) that we were not politicians or political competitors.
Government officials say that military leaders in imbabwe do not have their aim to remove the camp through their peacocks, but to take care of the 'criminals' around him.
Considering the continuation of revolution and regime, the camp tried to use the same strategy to suppress Nangakwa, who had a little asylum in South Africa.
Apart from negotiating with the military, Mugabe also sought help from the region.
South Africa, which was important to this practice - not only because of its economic and regional strength, but also because of the then President Jacob uma being the SATC leader - made it clear that if the army had entered Mugabe's house, it would soon reach Harre.
The news source told Independent that New and African leaders did not want to do it because they did not want it.

China requires a strong leadership, otherwise the 'breaking' policy refers.

China celebrates this year as it faces the challenges of the falling economy and anti-state demonstrations in the Chinese region of Hong Kong, as it is confronting with the US in a tough trade war.
It noted that the country will never leave China's interests, and will not compromise its security and sovereignty.
'The threats to trade war and the continued increase in taxes are not suitable to solve the problem,' he said.
China is an emerging economy with the overall industrial system, holistic industrial ties, comprehensive market and strong economic ties.
Commercial wars will never weaken it, he added.
China is confident that it can face difficulties and transform the obstacles into stairs and create a new world.
It added that China has no intention to challenge the United States or to return to the United States, and that the US has to see China's progress intellectually.
The US cannot control China, and there is no possibility of preventing China's growth.
The prevention and suppression of other countries will not strengthen the US by taking domestic issues abroad.

After the difficulty of eating, the stoppage of Space Carls-in-Mel-C diet talks

Video shows that the tourist place is very dirty .
Sydney port, surrounded by 21.9 billion dollars per year for the Australian economy and the largest contribution to the Sydney tourism sector, is Opera House, Circular uay, Luna Bars and Identity Bridge.
But under the bridge is a bitter fact.
Sydney's famous port is one of the most dirty waterways in the country, of which 15 Olympic swimming ponds are covered every year.
This statistics, which attracts tourists, makes this place one of our most dirty places.
According to a new video conference named Sydney Port, it is full of cigarette pieces, plastic bags and bottles, remote footwears and clothing and dead animals in the water surrounding Australia's most famous city - all of them reach the port via rainwater.
But plastic is a big part of our waterways.
In a video conference published in collaboration with the World Tourism Day on 27th September, Dr. Ketherin Tafran, Deputy Director, Sydney Port Research Programme, said, "I am a pillar.
It looks beautiful to see, but it is one of the most transformed and dirty toilets in our beaches.
Plastics of about 1560 kilometres per hour come into our waterways, most of them enter the port through rain water streams.
Dr. Tafran said, "The port is in a very bad condition following some of the major raining events.
One-third of these wastes comes through rain water filtering.
However, as 70 percent of the plastics in the sea reach the sea, the problem of the Sydney port is large under the slope as a iceberg.
Richard Nichols, owner of the Manli Divya Centre, pointed out that he and his crew were personally expelling 500 kg of plastic every year and said, 'If you spend time under water, you can only know what is really there.'
Perhaps most people know it (what is in water), they will be shocked.
Half of the plastic bags we found.
The remaining 50 percent is at least plastic.
When you see the port, it looks very beautiful, but people don't believe that all these plastics and wastes are below its surface.
Germany Brew, Director of Ossan Protect Sub-Corporator and Management, said that both local and tourist are the same ways to reduce the level of plastic and waste access to our waterways.
It should start from the fundamentals, he added.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use and recycling better and to reach the sea at the end of our dwellings.
If we destroy the ocean, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of our breathing oxygen comes from the ocean.
It sucks 30 percent of carbon diameter and food resources.
But we can fix this port and bring it to its old position, it is very easy.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.
This video, supported by the Renewables Institute, DOMRA (TOMRA), is part of its widespread efforts to make Australians aware about the conservation of environmental protection and reducing the consumption of drunken beverages of nature, collaborates with a study on plastic and psychological issues released this month.
In a poll with 546 children from 12 to 18 years, 82 percent of the people were unbelievable about plastic waste, and 25 percent blamed the elderly for a single use plastic problem.
Concerns about the level of plastic that reaches the ocean are increasing, while 93 percent of the 551 parents who were asked to say, the study also showed that the parents had a fourth of the most worried matters.
We want to do something about plastic waste, but we don't know how to make a difference, many of them have said that it is a matter of concern for the environment.

Tasmanian tables can be guided to cure cancer .
The Dasmanian TVs can guide cancer curing - researchers have discovered a turning point to revolutionize the treatment of patients.
Medical researchers found out how some cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers found that this process is going on with Dasmanian TVs and humans .
This innovation is expected to provide new ways to treat cancer patients .
What's normal with Dasmanian tables and humans
Cancer cells that don't look eyebrows.
Researchers, including those who came from Melbourne's Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, have innovated innovations to bring about a revolution in the treatment of many types of cancers that have not responded to the immune system.
It may have an important feature of resolving dangerous facets that threaten the future of the destructive Dasmanian Twelves.
The study discovered a group of proteins, PRC2, hiding itself and preventing the immune system from acting as a precaution to attack cancer and hiding some cancer cells in humans and organisms.
This can be a major challenge in treating small lung cancer, neuroplastoma and mercel cells.
President Peter Mac Researcher Mark Dasson AAP told the Institute that in a short span of time, we can be able to revert the process to the patients against immunization system.
Targetable MHs can be replaced with the aim of existing treatments and can be detected by cancer cells.
Prof. Dasan said that it is possible for people with tuberculosis cancer to have long-term benefits.
This is one of the most illnesses in the world.
We can provide better treatment for this.

Scientists are confused about roaming around the greatest planet very small star
Scientists are surprised to discover a solar family that is 30 light years away from the earth, which rotates a small star called Red Dwarf, a large satellite like Thursday, which challenges the present understanding of planet creation.
Released on 26th September, 2019, GJ 3512B is the art form of the largest gas surrounding its smallest nutritional star Red Dwarf.
Normally the stars will be bigger than the largest planets that surround them.
But the researchers said on Thursday that there was no major difference between the stars and the gloves in this event.
The star GJ-3512 is 12 of our sunset, while the quantity of the surrounding lane will be at least half of the end of the largest lane of our solar family.
It is a surprising thing that Air Staff Carlos Morals, at Catholonia Space Research Institute, Spain, led by a research published in the Science Journal, said.
The innovation was amazed by the theoretical models that small stars like Earth and small Neptunes usually possess small planets.
In this, we have discovered a small star roaming around a large planet like Thursday," said Morals.
The satellite, which was supposed to be largely gased like Thursday, was discovered using a vision at the Caller Altozer Laboratory in Spain.
It's roaming its star in its long stretch for 204 days.
Red Dwarfs are small and low temperatures on the surface.
GJE 3512 is not only too smaller than our sun, but also about 35 percent bigger than Thursday, which is comparable to a large quantity.
They reflect less energy, and their surface temperature will be less than 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6,380 degree Fahrenheit 3,527 Celsius).
That's why they have red colors," said Morals.
Morals said that while the star was the source of a second planet rotating, the third planet would have been driven from the star family in the past, it explains the lengthy path of that cell like Thursday.
The planets are produced from the same layer of gas and dust between the layers that make the surrounding stars.
According to the premier model for creation of satellites, called "Made Growth", a substance is initially produced from solid pieces of the layer, the geography of the cereals leads to an eruption from the surrounding gas.
An unstable and unstable geography model for this can be explained to the contradictory system.
In this event, the protoplantary layer surrounding the youngest star would be greater and colder than expected, he added.
This makes the layer irregular because of which some dense areas may arise.
These pillars can grow up to the scattering, creating a planet.
In Tripura, the order issued by the State High Court has become a big debate by banning sheep and fox sacrifices in the temples.
In 1949, the state government has stated in the court that Tripura's promise to join India was violated.

The Agreement was signed by the then Tripura ueen Kanchan Prabha Devi and Governor of India.
The main feature of the Agreement is that Tripura Government will continue to provide financial assistance to traditional worships for 14 temples, including the famous Tripura Sundarni Temple.
In Tripura Sundarni temple, he used to offer sheep.
The government is also providing financial assistance for this.
This should not be changed is a key factor in the Connectivity Agreement with India.
On the contrary, Subhas Patelji continued a public welfare trial in Tripura High Court that the sacrifice of sheep and sheep with government financial assistance is a reflection of the minds of Hindus.
Division Bench Judges Sanjay Karol and Arindham Loth, who questioned the case, banned that sheep should not be sacrificed at religious places in Tripura.
The court has ordered that the government should not help such sheep sheep sacrifices.
Moreover, the court has sent notices to all district magistrates and police supervisors to respond to the matter.
At the same time, the court has directed that the temples should not be sacrificed except with sheep and sheep, and all the temples should be installed and monitored by CCDV cameras.
At present, the State Government is appellating the Supreme Court against this order of Tripura High Court.
Highlighting that Tripura High Court has rejected its argument that it should not violate the promise made when India joins India in 1949, the State Government has made an appeal to the Supreme Court.

"Whether our meeting with Obama Trust leaders or helping women from all over the world get their education, he is inspired by many," Obama added, and a photograph with the leaders of the Trust with Meghan inspired.

In an interview, Obama said, "It was the best thing to permit to be a mother."
Mother taught me that most of the times my work was to give them a place to find and allow them to grow as they wish.
At that age, I don't want to think of whom they should come, and who is inside them.
Obama gave some suggestions to the prince in a interview on housing maintenance, which was directly aware of the problem of being a world-wide philosopher.
The pressure you feel from within you and others - may be very high in some times, he added.
Therefore, my great advice, take some time and don't need to do anything.
In the first few months of the White House, I was mostly worried that my daughters had a good start in school and to ensure that new friends are available.
I think it was right and good.

The organisation postponed the complaint that the majority of the three ministers, two completed judges and two Rabis had not lived in the province, nor had any property in the province, on Wednesday.
The Washington Post says that this is the second time that the complainants demand the cancellation of the hotel's drunken licence in the province's law that those who apply for the licence must have 'good practice'.
It has been reported in the initial stages of the last summer that President Donald Trumb is breaching the legislation by referring to allegations and frauds on the attack.
The licence was already granted and it was postponed.
The second complaint was received following the renewal of the license.

Now new appeals are coming to dissolve the army, which has seen five chief guards in six years.
It fails in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect those affected.
After our previous study, there is a significant improvement," said HM's consultative researcher Fil Komle.
Chief Guard Mikewelley, who left in January for a year when he faced 'interrupted' but unpublicated allegations about his practice.
Following the arrest of Assistant Chief Guardian Atrian Roberts on suspicion of the worst behavior, he was abolished.
Last year, deputy inspector Saimon Hurout was present before the committee for misconduct to prepare his colleagues for sexual intercourse.
He was out of the army.
Deace Valley's Tory Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'This is an official testimony to the dissolution of the army.
Now the time has come for the Home Ministry to intervene.
Chief Police Officer Richard Louis said: "I am fully committed to transform the past," he added.
Nancy Fellowsy: William Fair has become 'Pokkiri', the postal inquiry should be done slightly.
You never know where we're going next.
I think we are now engaged in hiding the cover and it may take some time to investigate," said Pelosi in an interview with CNN on Capital Hill.
He said they will do the work done by following the realities and the time to find out the truth.
This week's White House's written copy showed Trump to Ukraine President Volodimir Selenski that former Vice President Joe Piten and a 2020 candidate and a son of Piten were asked to examine.
In this regard, Trump told Selensky to work in collaboration with Bar and his personal lawyer Rudy ulyani.
Trump denied that he had not done anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN reported that the judicial department had been first warned by national security lawyers about the complaint issued by him about the practice of Trump on Ukraine, a week before the regular recommendation.
After receiving the complaint as a recommendation received from the intelligence department officials, the judiciary decided that there was no need to conduct a campaign financial criminal inquiry for the phone call of Trump.
Asked whether to testify to Bar, Pelosi said that the intelligence committee would decide on Friday to invite anyone to testify.
He further said that he believes that seeing has become a pocket.
He has been so for a long time.
Felozy noted that Trump had spoken about his Attorney General in July with Ukraine's head and said, 'This is the reason that it has been mentioned in all (par)'.
He is keen to take decisions on how to handle the complaint.
Felozy said that he was more worried about the data source of his secret, while speaking to him on Thursday as slaves, Trump said that the slaves were carried out in different ways at that time.
I think the President's statement violated irresponsibleness and it was dangerous.
Those who publish secrets have a key role in expressing the mistakes in our government, Pelozy said, "The President said this is a serious doubt of the government's honesty about those who can give information to the secret publishers."
On Tuesday, Pelozy carried out a historic act of declaring a formal posting inquiry into allegations that he tried to pressurize a foreign leader for political profits.
In a complaint issued to the public on Thursday, the phone call was included and accused a man of secrecy that Trumb had misused his power in the upcoming elections in 2020.
He alleged that the White House lawyers had told the officials to remove the phone call from the computer collecting nails and keep them in a private organisation for secret information.

Kana: Coffee Manu is concerned about the formation of the Committee for Research.
Shri Gofi Manu, a football executive and Secondy Hazagas officer, has expressed concern over the formation of a review committee for the forthcoming Kana Football Association (GFA) elections.
He also questioned the inclusion of Mr. Frank Davis, Chairman of the Committee, and he was not happy to join.
In an interview to the GNA Sport, he said that he is likely to be justified by the decisions of the study process.
The review committee must have intermediate persons coming from outside without any contact with any member and have already no benefits.
For instance, Mr. Tevis Agreement was signed as a prosecutor to write to Osei Wagu Balmar about 10 per cent of the fee.
He is a well-known Olympic supporter.
Because of his benefit, he should not be allowed to continue in the review committee for these two reasons, he argued.
Mr. Manu, a director of Olympics, said that if he appears before the Olympics, he would have a desire to contradict the relationship with the Club and suggested that if Mr. Palmar appears before the team, there would be discrimination and distinction.
After assuming office at a function held at the GFA Secretariat in Agra on September 19, the members of the team are expected to start the first work tomorrow and end on October 4.
Mr. Frank Davis, the Chairman of the Committee, will be members of the Corporate Adviser and Legislature Smt. Marian Parner and Immanuel Darwah.

As Rupa Gurunath was elected as the president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, it is said that the son of former minister Sonamundi had also tried for the post.
Various reforms are being made under the recommendation of the Lotha Committee on Cricket Board of India and State Cricket Associations.
The Lota Committee's recommendations include one of the cricket associations, which cannot continue to remain in office for more than two times, and those above 70 years of age cannot come to office.
Accordingly, those who had already been in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association were unable to go to office.
There was an atmosphere to choose new ones.
Dimugha, the son of former minister Ponamudi, Ashoka Sikamani, has moved vegetables to seize the post of president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but India cements Chinivasan has broken the attempt.
So, Ashoka Chikamani took over as the Vice President without any other means.
He is the youngest son of Sonamudi, who runs a child welfare hospital in KK, Chennai.
Asoka Sikamani was very interested in cricket before schooling.
At one stage, he was engaged in an effort to join the Indian team.
India Cements Cinemavasan is the reason why the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association is now elected uncompetitive leader and executives.
Perhaps the competition would have given a duff to the daughter of Asoka Sikamani Chinivasan, the son of Ponnumu, who took over as the leader.
Associated with the Vice President of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, Ashoka Chikamani will remain peaceful only after he had spoken peace on the Chinese side.
The case is sought to hand over Tamil scripts to Tamilnadu Archaeological Department at Mysore inscription.
The Central Archaeological Department has ordered the Madras High Court to respond to the ongoing hands taken for preservation and revival of archaeological symbols taken from 27 Tamil Nadu Til inscriptions.
Mani Charan filed in Madurai: The Department of Archaeological Survey under the control of the Central Archaeological Survey at Mysore, Portuguese.
Ancient Calvettes and historical architectures of India are being preserved there.
Inserted in Tamil inscriptions, philosophy documents are a source of scientific confirmation of the history of Tamils.
Further, it has been documented in Tamil Nadu inscriptions.
In such a scenario, when the workshop office in Mysore was transferred from the old building to a new building, most of the plains of ancient Tamil inscriptions were damaged.
The inscriptions and historical records should be preserved regularly and preserved as books and maintained e-systems.
However, the documents relating to Tamilnadu were not properly protected in Mysore.
Thus, the history and traditions of Tamils are unaware of the future generations.
Therefore, he said that the Tamil scriptures from Mysore inscriptions should be handed over to the Tamilnadu Archaeological Department.
On Wednesday, Visa Ranai came to the session of Shivajiram and R. Tarani.
The Justices issued the case on 22nd October, by ordering the Central Archaeological Department to respond to the revival of the archaeological signs and the preservation of the archaeological signs, as taken from the Tamil Nadu inscriptions.
Appeals for a separate competition against Australia
Justine Tipuri says that the time has come to show goodness in the Australian race against the Australian team that determines the fate of Wells in the World Cup.
The victory against the Australian march will make them the most possible garment to win in the T-Private and ensure that they fight with France or Argentina in time.
But if the Australian team wins the Wells team for the 14th time in their last 15 meetings, it will drive Tipurich and the team to fight with the UK for the last eight seats.
"There is nothing hidden in this, the two teams will win and try to hold the first in the category," said Wells.
Some decisions were difficult in the past, but it was sweet to have won a victory against them (Australia) in the past autumn.
I think they will be in a serious vision of winning us again and at the same time we want to ensure that another success is achieved.
We know that it is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and the time has come to showcase the talent.
Wells has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African teams in the history of World Cup, which was a success when Australians won the third position 32 years ago.
Overall, under Chief Trainer Warren Gateland, only 7 successes have been achieved in 41 attempts against three Southern Jambans.
Wells stopped a series of failures against Australia in the 13-Test competition last November, one of the remaining 9-6 winners in the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
He said that before that victory, there was no obstacle in mind, it was difficult to say that.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... people might think there was some tension, I don't know.
At the end of the last competition, we left about 15 points, so it would be difficult to see the statistics.
If Wells wants to win, the struggle with Australia's renowned binding couples, Michael Hubber and David Bokka, would be important.
The 67-year-old Tipurich has played against these two soldiers in several previous competitions, so he knows what is going to happen.
These seven people are completely world class heroes, he added.
You are always aware that the competition will be difficult when fighting with world class background winners.
Both of them continue to be the best heroes in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the best heroes in the world to save the ball is Pokak, Michael, a slight attacker, who has Rakbi's knowledge at the right place at the right time.
You must challenge yourself with the world's best players than fighting with the following players who do not play properly.
You would like to play against the best heroes, and when you play against these two heroes, you must be with the best player.
I don't say that the event to be held on Sunday is final, but this is an important competition for us in this world cup.
The inspiration of the society is an important part of it.
It will be difficult to win you if you continue to play well and showcase excellent performance.
Sea water level rises at Chennai Sea
The Inter-Governmental Committee on Climate Change (IBCC) has warned that four Indian coastal cities Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai are possibly drowned due to an increase in sea level.
IBCC, which reviewed the climate change work of IN, has released the survey.
In this, at the end of this century, the Himalayas will melt rapidly and increase the sea level.
This will cause the risk of sea sinking in four cities of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face extreme water shortage.
The sea level is increasing faster than before.
This will affect 1.4 billion people worldwide in 2100.
Not only 4 coastal cities at Indian level, but 45 port cities worldwide and 50 centimetres above sea level are risky of floods.
Every year, due to the increase in this risk, nails and small islands are in a bad risk.
Moreover, if an urgent action is not taken to reduce global warming, the heat of the sea will increase and the destruction of maritime creatures.
There will be no shortage of sea food worldwide.
Cyclone marks are likely to be generated in large quantity.
Sea temperature has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
This has been marked in the Survey.
Estentres Spilers: After Windowny's shock, Pen kicks up for Kallam
With the shock of Windown Dean (Shona McCarthy) blowing up the dawn and repeatedly mixing it with his pawns, the tension between Kalam Haiway and Ben Mitchel will erupt once again in Estenders.
But both of them will be sorry about either the relationship between them or the atmosphere of anger
Kallam recently told Penn to see his weak and soft side, as he helped Pen's life-saving footsteps and repeatedly helped Baby Beal, and he and Pen gradually joined the idea to go to Tetting.
Widney is returning from holidays in a better mood than he left this night.
It is clear that after knowing his tragic marriage and the person who comes to his husband, he had escaped from Veford gave him the best benefit.
When he comes to his house, his mind gets connected with his feet.
But quickly, a fact that he expresses is hampering the inner darkness.
J. Mitchel (Jemy Parthvik) is worried that he began to drink again in the uin Vick Pub because he walks badly.
Callam goes to Benn and fights against him for all that happened to him when he is drunk and feeling.
Pen is calm, accepting the insignificance of the cycle, seeks him, and shouting long before that, the disappointment of the cycle becomes uncontrollable.
But after that, what will they go
The couple's attempt to go to Tetting next week, but Pen's intense thinking of his previous relationships is a threat to slaughter everything and try to do the couple.
But after proving to his homeophobic father, he is determined to fight for a new self-confidence.
The triumph will be screened at the Eastenters series at BBC on September 27, 8.30.
Due to the difficulty of the White House to know what is under the grassroots of office deficit.
On Thursday, the White House officials have been barred to decide how to confront the renewed efforts of the Democrats for the slaughtering of office, and a well-known person explained the situation that the 'blood fear' has been inevitable for the past one week because there was no solution to this new problem.
A person close to the White House said that the allegations of the secret published could seriously affect the president and his surroundings, as it seemed to be increasing 'interruption, inconvenience and concern' in the West.
There is an unbelievable situation where there is nothing, he said.
The White House officials are unaware of what to do, not because there is no transparent plan for the situation, but because the usual methods used by the President in the past are not useful to avoid the debate: 'It doesn't seem to be a matter of disappearance after the next news,' he added.
Another person who knows about these suggestions, the White House has received a grave shock, and if the scrutiny continues, the President replied as a sword and said that there is an increase in concern that the chances of going to the "incomplete" position are increasing.
While the pressure on the President is expected to increase day by day during the trial, he will continue to be 'sensitive' and some people around the President expressed the same concern.
It provokes concern that Trump's behaviour cannot be further calculated and unprecedentedly resisted - in the election year it is concerned in both the presidential and political conditions.
In the face of an unprecedented threat to his presidential post, Robert Muller's ability to reinforce his strategy during Russian intelligence has turned into defense from the trumpet of the attack.
By turning attention to the activities of Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Peden and killing one-sided confidence in him, Ukraine tried to lose his demand for helping the president to investigate his political opponents.
However, as many people in the White House have experienced Muller's intelligence, the helpers and advisers said that this method has started feeling differently.
On Wednesday, when the press meeting was considered to be a powerful presidential, one of the familiars told him about the situation that he had failed.
They said that Trump, who was happy with questions about Russian intelligence, appeared as if he had no mindset to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the Chancellor's allies believe that the secret publisher was not directly aware of the problematic phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Wolodimir Selenski - arguing that it would reduce his credibility.
Moreover, his truth inspires him to protect his beliefs that the President has been inside the camp, as often walked.
But a minute close to the White House said that the President's basic recognition figures are already at the top and the recognition of the new ones is not easily available for the recognition.
"In the next four months, there is no benefit in focusing on the presidency of the President, particularly if it breaks his legislative events and makes it a headline.
The other parties say that the arguers argued that the slaughter could help the presidential president is not fully aware of how his response would be.
Concerned White House officials are looking for advisers to help in replacing the retaliation.
While efforts are still in the initial stages, he said that the efforts such as the warroom are more clear whether it will benefit or in what form it will be.
The individual acknowledged the need for integrated legislative and communication strategies to confront the pace given to the Democrats' slaughtering efforts to oppose the public's support against the publication of a clear report publishing of the secret.
Foreign Minister Mike Bambio and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin pointed out that the Ukraine President would not release a trump's call to the President - regretted that there was no other way but to release the document after 48 hours and showed that there was no longer a long-term vision strategy.
It is expected that Robert Muller's investigation, which spoke only through his accusations, is expected to be more pressure than the time of the trial, added that a person who is expected to be involved in creating a response to the post, said Tromb's fit bull and former campaign manager Gore Levandosky.
But Levandosky said that the NCC News had said that it was not true that he had taken the lead for such an effort.
"I have done everything I have done for the last five years to support the President and his plan, but I have not consulted the President about joining a team to oppose a forgery attempt," he said.
J. Chekulo, who is a foreign lawyer from Muller's trial to Trump, is also involved in the slaughtering efforts.
On his remarks, NPC News said, "We will deal with matters at the same time," he said.
As Mmt Flot, the guide who worked during the Clinton trial, was released till the end of the Muller trial, the present legal adviser of the White House has no such experience, the lawyer who is experienced in the prosecution is not present at the White House.
A person familiar with the White House's strategy that no one is close to the integration of all or the establishment of war rooms, but acknowledged that the integrated, combined answer and the need for a political struggle is to be carried forward.
It has been reported by the Department of Archaeological Survey in the morning that most parts of the country are likely to very heavy to very heavy rainfall in the evening.

Devin News blames Democrats for asking for 'Trump's Nirvana films
President Donald Trump's inquiry is obvious that Parliamentarian Davine News (R-Kalif) has not been able to do so.
He accused the Democrats of trying to get the presidential nirvana films to protect him on Thursday.
News, the chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee, accused the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Pitten and his son of accusing him of trampling Ukraine's help to conduct a trial, in the initial stage report of the allegation.
He said that the Democrats preferred to see the presidential nirvana photographs, and said that Ukraine was a 'mosquito shape' created by the left and their 'proper property'.
The Democrats of this team held discussions with those who thought they belong to Ukraine to get Tromb's salvation films, said News.
People can justify why they are determined to abolish the Chancellor when they have a chance in one year.
After News concluded his speech, Hufffost senior political reporter Genepher Pentry decided to find out whether the Democratic politicians want to know this matter deeply.
So far, the Connecticut Representative Jim Haims (D) has only responded, but we suspect that many of his colleagues will believe that his word is true.
Mediate.com suspects the News 'the ideas on the dwelling-in-the-boarding' in the deliberate steel documents indicates the 'incredible and unsolved extra details'.
It is a collection of former British slave Christopher Steel, who is accused of exploding charges against the trump, in which he is likely to see sex workers engaged in 'spreading water' at a hotel room in Moscow.
With the ballot of Udith Surya, who has been arrested in the case of fraud in the NEET examination, the description of Honey Medical College Chief Minister Rajendran to the CPCIT police has been changed.
Dr. Venkateson is a student of Chennai's Tandiar.
He is a doctor at Chennai Stanley Hospital.
His son, Udit Suryah, appeared to have been fraudulent in Nid's election.
CPCIT police arrested student Udit Surya and his father Dr. Venkatesan in the subsequent trial.
In the trial, Udhi's father Venkateson paid Rs.20 lakhs and cheated another student and collected a son in a medical college.
After this, Udid Surya and his father were arrested in court and imprisoned.
In such a situation, the CPCIT police had conducted an inquiry to the Chief Minister of the Government Medical College of Honey (pre-examination of Udit Surya) in connection with the NEET examination.
There is a distinction between his description and Udit Suryah's ballot from the CPCIT police.
In a briefing on the Chief Minister of Honey Medical College, Rajendran, he participated in the Halticket during the gathering.
It is said that the student admission was done on the basis of that.
It was stated on the Chief Minister's side that the person who wrote the NITE exams participated in the gathering and the student gathering, and Udhit Surya participated in the Kallury class only.
But Udit Suryah has said that he has been directly involved in synergy and student gathering through his vote.
How did Udit Surya go to Udhit Surya with a holticket with a photograph of a man who made a man's film
Why was it wrong to pay attention to the sympathy and student admission
uestions have arisen.
It is now known in the investigation that student Udit Surya has given the list of self-reliance lists with his photograph during the admission.
Photography in it and a picture in the hall ticket are different.
Besides, the vote given by student Udit Surya and the vote given by the Chief Minister of the Government of Honey, Rajendran, to the CPCIT officials is different.
Therefore, CPCIT police have also started hearings with senior officials.
If its results come out then the ruins will be there.
Who knows what to do.
In the case of cooperative bank fraud, Sarath Pawar said that the Implementation Department is going to be held tomorrow and said that I will not be subscribed to the Central Government.
The Maharashtra Cooperative Bank has suffered a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to the government treasury due to the frauds in 2007.
The loss has been reported due to reasons such as lending to sugar mills and hubu factories in violation of the rules.
In the case of these scandals, the Mumbai Police filed a lawsuit against senior nationalist Congress leader, former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and 70 people last month on the order of the Mumbai ICC order.
This includes political leaders, cooperative bank former executives and officials.
In this case, the enforcement departments have prosecuted Ajit Pawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Bawar on the basis of the case filed by the police.
Sarath Bawar was the former Chief Minister of Marathi and the Minister of the Congress-led government in the middle.
As the elections will be held on 21st October for the Marathi legislature, this action of the Implementation Department has become a stir.
In this context, Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Pawar spoke to reporters in Mumbai.
Thanks to the Implementation Department, when I am not a member of the cooperative bank concerned or a decision-making place.
I don't want to be surprised in this action.
I will probably be outside Mumbai for the assembly election campaign.
Therefore, the Implementation Department should not misunderstand me.
I'm going to the Implementation Office on Friday.
And I will give them the information they want.
Their right to investigate the case.
I believe in the Constitution.
Therefore, I will fully cooperate in the investigation.
Marathi is following the principle of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to move ahead of Delhi.
Marathi Chief Minister Devendra Patnavis has denied the accusation of political intervention on this matter.
In this regard, he said:
In this case, the ICC had ordered the police to prosecute the case and the Department would inquire about the implementation of the case when there is a fraud of Rs 100 crore.
In this context, the case has been taken into the hands of the Implementation Department.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable biofuel research can help reduce smoke emissions
Electric cars and desla semi-tracks have been set up as headlines in recent years, it seems as if they are flying without renewable energy limits:
But a professor of Alberta University has developed a technology that can enable renewable biofuels to use as air fuels.
Dr. David Pressler, Department of Agriculture, Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta, launched this program in 2003.
His laboratory is creating hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes like food oil, animal warnings and canola oil.
This technology will be able to use quality oil in ethanol and other biofuels, not just like ethanol and other biofuels, which will allow about 85 percent reduction in carbon exposure than the release of petrol-based fuels and use waste from other factories during the process.
This technology works to replicate the hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
Our technologies have been done in the first generation to create the same hydrocarbons in diesel cassolin, he added.
As it gives a new impression for biofuel use, the previously created biofuel technologies lose stability in low temperatures, which creates a serious problem for higher flying aircraft.
Brussels said, "The problem in aviation fuel is like a problem of kitch-22, which cannot be avoided."
In fact, its value is less than diesel, but its requirement is more.
The Brussels Laboratory is now focusing on two choices to produce biofuels for airplane.
Their hydrocarbon biofuels in the first territory are another refinery and a less dangerous approach to insert hydrogen.
The second choice will stabilize fuel even in low temperatures, and continue to work in a partially-made medical system.
On the second choice, Brussels said that we can play some sports along with the sports in our reactor, trying to change the wages a little.
There is more risk in it.
Forge Hydrocarbons, a sub-producing company of Alberta University, is working to manufacture it commercially because both the airlines and the Canada and the US military are investing more for renewable selection.
He hoped that in the future, somebody can impose carbon tax on them.
They expect a change in that situation.
Forge is now operating a laboratory near Edmandan's Waste Management Centre and has recently received US 4 million investment from Lakheet Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sompra in Andario.
The factory is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.
Though carbon releases are expected to be reduced by 85 per cent, Brussels also mentions the reasons for carbon publications not being decreasing, such as fuel transportation and production.
"A technological person,"
Brussels said that creating and selecting choices in a manner of decision-making is also a variety of opportunities.
The High Court has decided yesterday to review the fundamental right petition filed by the Maternal and Maternal Disease physician Sehu Shihabuddin Mohammad Shahi of Gurunakal Bodhna Hospital.
The petition will be taken by the High Court on January 24.
It is notable that the illegal abortion surveillance and irregular financing have been arrested under various charges, addressing the detention of the criminal sections and filing a physician's fundamental human rights petition.
In the midst of the Prime Minister's request for peace, the Prime Minister calls on the people to peace after the warn of Boris Johnson's coalitions that Britain may face conflicts such as Las Angeles, if the Frexit is withdrawn.
Tonight, a senior Cabinet Minister said that the real decision is that the second turnout is a risk of acute and mass uprising in the country.
The prime minister's senior coalition parties warned that the UK would confront the unrest at home at the level of the yellow leaf struggles in France over economic inequality and the LASANGELS revolt in 1992.
Shri Janson said that the anger should be minimized in political language, but I would not stop using the word 'Absolution'.
While he demanded peace, a cabinet minister told the Times: 'We have not yet seen Killetz Johns [Honal Clear] struggle in this country or the Las Angeles riots [in 1992].
People do not think that this is possible in this country because it does not happen before.
Now they have a model of yellow layer struggle and modern phones to integrate it, and only two well-known leaders needed to inspire the people.
The riots ended in Las Angeles in 1992 following the court's release of four white police officers in the case of black auto driver Rodney King.
At the beginning of this year, the catastrophe and devastation in the streets of Paris over six weeks by French revolutionaries against a well-known yellow leaflets - Glet Jones-worn state.
Shri Janson warned that if Britain fails to withdraw from the European Union, 'the loss of confidence in our political establishment will increase.'
If 66 percent of us say that 30 million people might have joined the vote, 10 million people are still unsatisfactory, he added.
Though 99 percent of them are neglected, more than 100,000 are really angry, they write to their parliamentarians and prevent it.
There is no need for it, and thousands of people will soon be on the streets.
A senior Cabinet Minister further said that if the first referendum changes the second referendum, there is a risk of severity and mass uprising in the country.
Mr. Janson has called on voters to hold a general election to resolve the Braxid issue.
It is said that he is confronting ministers' insurgency to reduce his Braxid demands and replace it with a compromise agreement with the European Union.
His brothers who killed Pakistan's social media popularity 'Gaurava' have been sentenced to life
Women's rights experts say that justice is often not implemented with criticism, while the procedures are sustained in some time, the accused killers are released on bail and the cases are evacuated.
Farson Perry, a woman entitled and founder of Pakistan's first gender research department in a university, said, "People forget by taking a long time," and it took three years to resolve even in the most important Baloch case.
While the rights groups say that it is difficult to establish trustworthy data, the Human Rights Authority of Pakistan faced at least 300 cases of murder in 2018.
A large number of lawyers say that the actual number will be very high when the Gaurav-based Violence Awareness Network estimates that one-fiveth of the 5,000 honourable killings that take place in Pakistan every year.
Sustainable climate has caused floods and confusion in many parts of India
India's climate has grown almost a month, due to unprecedented rains, many crops have started rotating due to ruining buildings.
Normally in the beginning of September, climate declining in Northern India, but this month average rainfall was 37 higher than normal.
Indian climate researchers say that if the same situation continues in the remaining few days, it will remain the same in the last few decades.
In many parts of the country, there is still unprecedented rain and recently such rains have occurred in the western part of India, Pune, where the unprecedented rains on Wednesday and Thursday have destroyed many lives and buildings due to collapse.
With floods inside the houses, people walked on the streets, and usually such scenes can be seen at the height of the monsoon.
There was heavy rains in other cities like Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
Continuous rains have caused severe damage to houses in Uttarakhand in the north.
This monsoon started late.
At many places, the farmers were ready to look for drought.
Farmers do not want to sustain the weather.
It is not usual to rain so much during this period of the year.
This rotates my vegetables - cauliflower, beans, buttermilk and tomatoes," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer from Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.
Starting late, the continuing monsoon has led to prices for the consumers and the price of onion in Indian food has increased as an essential commodity.
Normally, onion is sold for one kilo 20 rupees (23 pounds) and 80 rupees (March 1) in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals are also in danger.
The next major festival, Dussehra, will come on October 8, when the Hindus will set up the brutal smile of Ramayana composer Ravana.
The burning of Ravana symbolizes the benefit of evil and against evil.
But in the event of these ruthlessnesses being carried out by paper, if the monsoon continues, it will finally win.
How will a government hospital be used for various facilities like bus stops, free vehicle stops, public housing and public meetings of political parties
This is the condition of a government hospital in the district of Thiruvananthapuram.
This is an important government hospital for treatment of 1000 to 1200 patients per day.

Four years later, Trikulam is now full.
District Collector P. Goldenya has said that the farmers will be able to select and grow the fastest growing oilfia fish.
Following is the text of his message:
Fishing farmers in cultivation pots will be able to grow faster than other fish if they select genetically improved telephia fish.
Telephia fishes can be increased by more storage in less area than other fish.
These are faster than other fishes with higher immune capacity.
Moreover, consumers like this kind of fish.
Therefore, the farmers are asked to select and enhance genetic fishes in their cultivation poultry.
The Government is ready to sell fish farms near the Tilepia Fisheries Kunchulam Dam throughout the year.
Farmers can buy and benefit from these.
The farmers who grow these fishes should look at their fish farms surrounding and protecting their neighbourhood and see the color that they do not spread in the water levels near them.
Fisheries should be registered at the Fisheries Development Camp in Kanchipuram district and after that it should be developed in their cultivation.
Fisheries Assistance Director, Department of Fisheries (DoFF) can also be telephonicated on the eastern coastal road, Nilankarai, Kanchipuram district by direct or 044-24492719.
The three-pronged Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed to conduct DNA testing of human bones available below.
The Triple Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed in collaboration with the Archaeological Department of Tamil Nadu, Kamaraj University of Madurai and Harvard Medical School for conducting DNA testing of ancient human bones excavated from underground Tamil Nadu, Gondagai and Adichandanal.
Udaychandran, Chief Secretary and Commissioner, Department of Archaeological Affairs said:-
The three-pronged MoU will be signed in collaboration with the Archaeological Department, Madurai Kamaraj University and David Reach Laboratory, Harvard School.
We believe that in our future absorptions, we will find more ancient human bones at the bottom, bottom and primitive juncture.
These models will be sent to the TNA study.
This will highlight what kind of genes were there in the human bones excavated in Tamil Nadu.
Increasing insecticides can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
A new study shows that working with a large amount of insects can be a cause of heart disease in the past.
It was in the group of Japanese Americans in Hawai, who had been followed for more than three decades.
In comparison to those who don't work with pesticides, researchers found that the maximum number of persons suffered from heart disease or paralysis had 45 percent more risk.
The Survey insists on the importance of individual defence equipment at the time of professional insecticides and the importance of documenting in medical records and controlling normal heart disease risk factors, the Vice-Administrator Dr. Beatris Rodrix said.
He is a senior medical officer at Hawai University, Manoa.
These innovations have emerged from the data received from more than 6,000 persons in Ohu, who participated in the Guakini Honellu Heart Program.
Researchers said that because only men from the Japanese dynasty participated, these innovations do not apply to women and others.
Because the pesticides have a long half-year age, they may have many years of age and have their effects on health.
The event witnessed the maximum impact within the last 10 years.
In a message, Rodrix said, "After 34 years later, there was no connection between insecticides and heart diseases and paralysis.
With the importance of other factors related to age, it is possible to conceal possible connectivity between pesticides and heart diseases in ancient life.
Researchers discovered that there was no significant connection between insect microbes and heart disease or paralysis.
Jelanski-Trump phone call: Porosenko's views
This week, Washington's politics became a brilliant one after the US President Donald Truff's initiation of slaughtering measures.
Volodimer Selenski, less experienced in politics, would have wanted to avoid dragging into a political fraud.
But what do we know about the Selenski-Trum links, is it a long-term impact on Selenski
At the beginning of the phone call, Trumb told Selenski that the US is doing more to Ukraine than any other European country.
Though the White House's call does not speak a word, the German leader and other European leaders have just spoken of decisive plans - the German leader, Enzla Merkel, explained that he was trampling.
Trump does not accept 100 percent, but it is considered difficult to replace Selenski, who claims to accept 1000 percent.
Selenski added that France's Chancellor McRon and Merkel did not work enough to help Ukraine.
The conversation has made politicians, particularly the opposition parties within Ukraine, public opinion in the social media.
Ukraine's former president, Petro Porchenko and the European Union's help is 'not yet' commented in a tweet.
Porzhenko said he was grateful to the European Union's assistance, including restrictions and economic assistance during the 'Russian occupation' in Porzhenko and other tweets.
Ukraine politician Victoria Wacisca said, 'How can we talk to Germany and France again'
Trump, who is indirectly referring to military aid, is not only about Jo Piten's son Hunter, but also a hacked DNC server, to Selenski, to investigate two matters, which shows Ukraine's intervention in hacking Republican emails during the 2016 election.
I do not know whether relations with Europe are blocked or whether relations with France and German Chancellors will break down.
I don't want to misrepresent anyone.
Selski said, "We thank all of us for helping us," at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Selenski will meet Russia, Germany and French leaders at the four meetings to be held in the month of October.
A calm darkness, suddenly furious and shines the surrounding stars.
If such a darkness turns into a shining nuclear concept, it is called 'Guvasar'.
Scientists have seen the lighting of six such guvasars in the Palomar distance of America.
It has been surprising to the scientists for thousands of years and it has happened within six months.
In order to grow a lot of trees, they are inserting carbon dioxide in the air and release oxygen.
But, the 'Hypergeant Industries' produced, 'Ios', 'Bio Reactor' instrument, enters a multiple carbon dioxide rather than carbon dioxide of 1 acres of trees.
It is the fascination of 'Churchella Walgaris' that grows within the ios bio-reactor like a cool basket, which enters carbon dioxide.

Recent restrictions have been made due to harmful chemicals in e-cigarettes.
People do not have much awareness about this.
Young people should stay away from e-cigarettes.
There is a misconception that there is no risk of e-cigarettes.
Heating nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes, creating a kind of chemical smoke, like normal cigarettes, will harm health.

Peter Cainer, Responsibilities Administrator of the Central Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a witness to the Internal Defence Sub-Committee inquiry on the budget demand of FEMA 2020 for the FEMA on April 3, 2019 at Capital Hill, Washington in America.
Washington (Reuters) - the White House said in a report that Peter Cainer, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was appointed by US President Donald Trump on Thursday.
Cainer, the deputy executive of FEMA, is the head of the agency, who oversees the government's actions for disasters such as cyclones and forest islands.
Since Brack Lang's departure from office in March, the organization has remained unauthorized by the Senate Council.
Long resigned after the decision of the Homeland Security Department responsible for the FEMA that Lang used government vehicles to visit Washington and his home in northern Carolina.
After another nomination for that work, Jeffry Pyard, who was involved in a fight in Paril during his background exam, returned from the competition earlier this month.
Cainer's appointment to the post was expected.

If this project is implemented, one unit of electricity can be produced at a cost of Rs 2.50.
We have planned and implemented a project of Rs 6,000 crore to prevent mixing of 3000 DMC water from Godavari in Andhra Pradesh.
However, the water storage projects are being implemented in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, however, many times, but there is no benefit.
There will be no water problem between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka due to the prevention of mixing water in the sea.
There has been no progress in the issue of negotiations so far.
Kadkari said this.
Shri Gadkari participated in the laying ceremony of the foundation stone for the 13 States launched by the Kairi Board.
When Kadkari got up, Bhajagavan shouted as 'Bharat Mata Ki Je' as usual.

Police shut down Marijuwana Wamping at San Capriol Valley: CPS Los Angeles
El Mande (CPSLA) - An illegal Marijuwana neem coat in San Capriol Valley closed on Thursday
At around 4.37 p.m., at around 4:37 p.m., at a office building in Delstar Avenue's 9600 block - in big strips, Pyoten honey oil and enriched Ganja oil.
LD Christopher Keno, who is in police, said that officials were discovered as an instrument used to use nep cadets.
Keno said, This is a very dangerous process.
Keno, who worked in the narcotics sector, said that there is a chance to take the fire in the process of harvesting oil for use of neem products.
As it is enriched, the normal power generated in our clothes will create firecrackers and create an explosion, he added.
If there are many species and such commodities, the layer may be completely snatched into this accident without an ordinary fire accident.
A Hasmad team was called for an empty office to seize the material that was illegal and dangerous.
Immediately the value of captured goods and equipment was not known.
Specialists have said that when they got the search order through the unprecedented information they have received, they have found illegal action.
Investigating officers are still trying to find who is in the backdrop of illegal neeming operations.
They believed that because the place was empty, the person would have set up the office there.
As the trial continues, they wanted to ensure that unlawful neighbouring goods are not available to all, especially in the wake of recent information about neighbouring.
He said, "This is what they really want, and they are unaware," he said.
It can be mixed with other evil materials.
This is extremely bad for our society and children, so we always warn to avoid such activities.
First Elizabeth's losing clothes will be displayed in the Hampton court palace .
It has been engraved with the best sample plate, wounded with silver pieces, engraved with plants, animals and buffaloes.
Ellery Linnn, responsible for garments in the historical royal palaces, is only one of them.
100 years ago, he was hanging on the wall of a small village Parish church, and he saw that narrow cloth could be a dress away from Almari, the first Elizabeth cloth.
Three years later, after seeing the luxurious dress used in Altar's Church in Heerfordshire, at the Church in Beckton, the dressed dress of Elizabeth will be displayed next month near the same room where the dressed ueen was worn about 450 years ago.
The dress of the 16th century in the entire state dress collection will be the only one indicator of the innovation.
Three years of research strengthens the opinion of experts that the garment would have been compulsory as part of the garment of the state's family, even though there were no sword testimonies to describe that the garment was worn by Elizabeth ueen at a time.
The price of White Cloth is extraordinary, extraordinary dressed to the surplus members of the state family, and the embroidered plants and flowers have high quality, high quality of deer and dogs, buffaloes, fishermen and a bear.
When this council was formed, it might have an equal value to the tutor mention.
Moreover, in the 1950s, in the latter part of the Elizabeth regime, his enemies would not acknowledge that his enemies had worn such a fair dress when other women in the court had increased their competition.
It's a big thing, so many colleagues came and saw it.
It was always satisfactory to see that when they were surprisingly surprising to see that while leaving, they saw that the royal family was one of the clothing.
With the second long age in the dress compartment, it was again cut off to be the altar of the dark St. Faith Church in Peckton, which was unexpected to be found there.
Beckton has served the queen of Elizabeth for a long time and is a very close village of Blanch Barry, among the respected ladies who have served him, and local stories have long been associated with the textiles sector.
Specialists believe that the garment was of the later period of his death in 1590, although Elizabeth could have given it to the Perry family or the Parish Church in memory of Blanch before he died in the year 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of safety, more than 400 hours of which more than 400 bells will be screened after the most famous 'Rainbo Fortreit' in the contemporary paintings of Elizabeth, which showcases his wearing of such a crown, which gave the hotfield house loan during the exhibition.
Liby Thomson, who is headed by security, said, "When you work with heritage dresses, it is really respected for those who make them," the most part of its security took place in the changed cattle of the Hampton court fields - even a large place to keep some of the precious screenplays of Arabinai.
I had great respect for the manufacturers who had seen the embroidery in the past and behind.
I have never worked in such a rich man.
Elizabeth's losing dress is being displayed on October 12 at the Hampton court palace.
Udit Suryah, a student of Honey Medical College, came to light in the NEED examination.
After this, he has been arrested by CPCIT police personnel with family.
This has intensified the assessment work of students in all medical colleges.
In such a situation, there is a difference between the old pictures and present images of Goa's BSG Medical College student Jyotika and student Shiva Ramachandran.
This was followed by an inquiry by the Department of Medical College.
Narayan Babu, Director of Medical College, Chennai, today delivered an address to the press:
On 23rd, we complained that the photographs of both the students were a little bit different.
Thereafter, we formed a five-member inquiry committee.
We also conducted a trial with two students and their parents.
We have comparisoned their certificates, net examination hall tickets, identity cards and collection of documents with us.
In the end of this study, both students are sure that there is no fake people.
Even though there is a slight difference in pictures, such a problem arises.
Hence, the Health Minister has directed that the biometric process should be brought to the student inclusion from next year.
Biometric and handicraft registration will now be implemented in the coming days.
Details of the concerned students are Open only if they have registered a handloom during the period of application, examination and admission.
That's why no one can be cheated in this.
Subsequently, the students under the investigation, Shiva Ramachandran and Jyotika, spoke to the press.
Jyotika said, I was in the form of a double pair in the picture I gave.
It was taken at school time.
Now I have revised my hair.
So, it's not like that now.
That's why they have come together to look after me.
Now it has become a problem with hair cuts and there is nothing else.
Ramachandran said that there is a difference between the present image and the old picture.
I had only one photo at that time.
It's old photograph.
So there was a confusion and the inquiry took place.
The PANDI Plastic Association has requested Prime Minister Modi to save livelihood of millions of workers.
In a statement issued by Shankaran and Secretary V. K. Balu, the Minister said:-
Plastic waste is being collected and recycled in the streets and dustbins in India.
Currently, in some states of India, all the plastic items that are blocked are recycling.
Due to poverty and unemployment, India has already recycled 60 to 70 of plastic wastes.
The remaining waste can also be used in a utilized manner.
1. Plastic Tar Road 2. Electricity manufacturing 3. Petrol and diesel manufacturing 4. Plastic waste can be used in various ways.
Once used, carriage bags, which are considered to be important in the stuff, are given freely in the name of the compulsion of civilization to pack the goods in public shops.
In all the reservoirs, plastic carriage bags seem to be diversified.
Due to the low density of carriage bags, all other wastes, apart from plastic in reservoirs, go into the waters.
Unfortunately, the plastic only moves up.
There are 40 thousand plastic products manufacturing factories across India.
98 of these are small and microscopic.
Like this, there are thousands of shops that buy plastic items.
There are 2,000 companies exporting plastic products.
In addition to production and sale, about 50 lakh people are getting employment opportunities.
5 lakh crore sales and 50 thousand crore incomes have been provided by the Plastic Department to the Central and State Governments.
There is no environmental problem for the plastic industry, its production or its use of products.
Unfortunately, the environmental problem arises due to lack of awareness about environmental health.
Therefore, on 2nd October, the Prime Minister urges the workforce to make clear announcements that thousands of young and small entrepreneurs and millions of labourers who have relyed on this industry should be issued to strictly control the plastic wastes and to prevent livelihood.
This is what they say in the news.

Mexico smuggling chief causes one-third of the US drugs
CBS News visited Chicago's western part of Chicago after a little while after the sunrise.
Brian McNight, in the Drugs Implementation Administration (DEA), showed the light.
Nearly 800 people died in Chicago last year due to excessive consumption of drugs.
McNight said that about 90 of the drugs in Chicago are from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the summary renowned Nemasio Servates called L Manso.
Matthew Tonhak, Principal Agent, Mexico, said, "He is the open first priority for the DEA and the State Legal Implementation Department in the United States."
The prize for L Manchso is up to 10 million.
He has helped find dozens of L Manchso drug laboratories in the forest.
At least one-third of the intoxicating drugs entering the US through sea and land, Jellisco Nuva Generation or CJNC is the hijacker of Elmenso.
According to the Department of Justice, the hijacker kidnapped the 'Ton Account' Goken, Methambedaman and Herain embedded in Penton.
10 million prizes have been announced for the head of L. Menso.
Thirty years ago, when he lived in California, he was arrested on drug charges and finally hijacked to Mexico.
That's where he started terrible hijacking.
He has a large number of weapons, RBGs and 50 Caliber weapons.
On the basis of him, he got his own SWAT groups," said Tonhak.
Since the shooting of Mexico military helicopters, killing six people in this summer, El Manchso defends his empire without punishment.
Thousands of people have died in recent years due to the violence of smugglers.
According to Mexico government statistics, there are about 94 murders per day.
Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are very poisonous and cannot handle them without a security shield.
In the laboratory, smugglers are printed in cocaine bags.
More than one-third of them can be seen as the print of El Manchso.
Tonhak said, "He is the reason why he really sends a poison to kill parents and children."
Therefore, Tonhak said that if a child dies, it is a great opportunity to get these medicines from the system of El Manso.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died due to high drug addiction.
Union Minister Jitendra Singh has said that those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi as the Father of India should not call themselves Indians.
Everybody knows that the BJP leaders have been misrepresenting Gandhi and Nehru.
A few hours before the event of Howdy Modi in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitsha said that Pakistan's occupation could become a cause for Kashmir.
A few days ago, many Bhagawans, including Prayag Tagore, have lost Gandhi and praised Kotse.
At the 'Howdy Modi' event in Houston, Prime Minister Modi said that US President Trump would again support him as President.
Instead, US President Trump has praised Modi.
In his speech, he said that there were strong divisions in Hindi and as the father of this country, he removed the divisions and united them.
It usually shocked many people when Gandhiji was the father of India.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, "Howdy Modi, who was present on Prime Minister Modi, is using him to campaign for Trump.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong to replace Gandhiji as a father of India.
Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Shri Jitendra Singh said, "American President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the father of India.
Some have opposed it.
Thus, those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi as the father of India should not call themselves Indians.'

It is its moral duty to voice the credibility of the southern world, especially the growing smaller countries, as the paralysis movement involves 55 percent of the world's population.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the militia campaign to counter the current global challenges against national borders such as conflicts, migration, climate change and infectious diseases.
Unconventional security threats such as climate change have emerged not only as economic and social challenges but also as a threat to security affecting society and countries due to human catastrophe.
While welcoming the UN Secretary-General Summit on Climate Change on 23rd September 2019 at the UN Headquarters, Secretary Arya Singh expressed his deep concern over the negative impact on climate change in islands such as Sri Lanka.
Foreign Secretary expressed confidence that the COP25 to be held in Chile will enhance efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the duties mentioned in the Paris Agreement.
Foreign Secretary Arya Singh said that Sri Lanka has the importance to oppose all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and needs to focus on the new threats proved by Easter Sunday's attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threat threatens the security of all countries and not handle it separately by one country, but collaborative efforts are necessary, and called for a non-partisan movement to contribute in a positive and harmonious manner to this global security threat.
The Foreign Secretary said that Sri Lanka believes in a free society envisaged by freedom of opinion, but has to be cautious about the threat of abusing hatred, Internet and social media bases.
The concept of the Ministerial Level Meeting was 'stablishing the policies of sovereignty and political independence as a means of maintaining international peace and security and enhancing relations and collaboration between the countries' and the result document was accepted during the meeting.
Sri Lanka is a Joint Coordinator of the 1955 Bunding Conference and a founder of the Parisera Movement.

Ronald Lee Hoscale: The person who killed his former wife's family in Texas was punished
Ronald Lee Haskell was punished to kill Stephen and Cathy Ste and his five children during the spring of 39, 2014.
On 9th July, 2019, he entered Stein's house to find out his wife Melani Haskell's residence.
He was not there but his sister Keth Stay and his family were there.
Harris County Sharif's offices reported that two girls of Stephen Stay, 39, Kethi Stay, 33, 13 and 4, and two girls of 9 and 7, were killed when the hoscale shot.
Only one of the family lived when only a 15-year-old Gasty Stay lived.
Officials noted that even after some time he was completely cured, he was injured at that time.
Ronald Lee Haskell's seizure was held by the natives rejected Thursday as unanimous.
The court was postponed till Monday for the sentence.
Guantam Internet closes thrills: Science newspaper
The decision of a US military research has brought the Guantam website closer to a step.
Such a portal will provide security, discovery and timely capabilities in normal network approaches to the Army.
The Centre for Guantum Information Distributed at the Army Research Laboratory of the US Army Response Capacity Development (ARD), which will be funded and managed by the Army Research Office of the Laboratory, has seen the achievement of the Institute of Researchers using fiber optic cables between pulses and lights - a 50-kilometer long uantum Backward Transformation.
Backward is a interconnect between guandam steel products like cubits.
If connectivity between two cubits and measured one, the decision to measure the other will affect it, even if the second cubit is very early.
'This [50 kms] is far away from the procedure for creating the quantity of two orders in the area and the start of the guandam networks in the cities,' the researcher at the University of Inspect, and the principal researcher for the project, his innovations have been published in the Nature Journal Guantum Information.
The guandam networks in the middle of the cities are built by physiotherapy financing miners of physiotherapy, although they are far away, will be uncomfortable.
Scientists said that distribution of this background is essential for establishing Guantam Web site.
Sara Campbell, Joint Military Programme Supporting this Research, said, "It is an important step towards making the massive distributed background possible."
On the other hand, after traveling through fiber, the quality of retreat on the other side is higher than the most difficult quantum network usage to meet the requirements of some.
The research teams launched a test by using calcium atoms absorbed in an iron engine.
While using laser illuminations, researchers produced a quantum position on Irene, Guantam provoked a potato collected information.
As a result, the quantum positions of the atomic and light pieces were retreated.
It is a challenge to send photographs through fiber optic cables.
Lanyan said, "Fotan's wave of calcium is 854 Nanometers, which is soon absorbed by optical fiber".
Therefore, his team first sent the light pieces through a negative lesson that was lighted by a strong laser.
The Botton channel has become favourable for a long distance - to 1550 Nanometers of the current standard channel for telecommunications.
After that the researchers sent the potane through a 50-km fiber optic cable.
Even after the wave change and far-flung journey, their measurements showed that the nuclear and light pieces were still at the back of the station.
The decisions provide a direct way to enable the use of calcium in collaboration with the high-level Cubid to enable the long-range network to enable the use of calcium.
Defence is very important for large-scale backward dark networks, accuracy, guidance and timely uses," said Dr. Fredrick Fademi, Vice-Major of the scheme, said Dr.
