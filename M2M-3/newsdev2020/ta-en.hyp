Police Monitoring Organisation recommends friendship with Women Entrepreneurs Geneffer Arguria
The independent office for the police operation will now be estimated whether the prime minister should be investigated for a criminal offense in the government as a Mayor of London.
The Greater London Authority (GLA) surveillance officer has registered a 'conduct related matter' on the charge of prioritizing the friend of Ms. Argury with the Prime Minister.
He said there is a "conventional matter" when there is information that may have been a criminal offence.
It does not mean that it was proved in any way.
The IOPC will now consider whether the matter should be investigated.
The matter has now been recommended to the IOPC, which handles complaints against police in UK and Wells.
It was recommended to the Monitoring Organisation as Mr. Janson was in the same position as the Police and Criminal Commissioner.
Johnson has denied that there was no mistake about his friendship with Mrs. Arguria.
He stressed that they have committed a crime against a person, and asked the London Legislature to give details of his relationship with Ms. Arguria.
Seven years ago, Mrs. Arguri, a migrant American in London, was given 126,000 from the public fund and was allowed on the basis of concession in three foreign trips led by Mr. Janson as Mayor.
Subsequently, Mrs. Arkuri's firm Hacker House has stopped the government under revision of the decision to provide 10,000 subsidies to the company.
It reflects these questions on the pre-monetary supervision process.
Digital Minister Mt. Varman said that his department had made 'discriminatory routine practices' and had a British telephone number.
However, the calls for the telephone number, Ms. Arguri, reports that 34 had been transformed into an existing California office.
Prime Minister's friend with the Women's Entrepreneur's Friendship, 'Everyone knows the secret'
This move of GLA, which recommends the Prime Minister to the Freedom Office for Police Operations, has caused anger to number 10.
This is a 'politically provoked attack' and the Conservative Party Conference is scheduled to be held during this period, a senior government news source said, 'Open political is transparent.'
'No evidence has been provided by the surveillance officer,' she said, 'The Prime Minister had no opportunity to respond to the surveillance officer before the report was released on Friday night.'
The public and the media will be well aware that this was clearly smelled with a political outlook.
Standardim was earlier told today that with the help of the London Tourism Development Agency, Mr. Janson's close contact with the California Industries was 'All Knowledge Clear'.
The former officials of the London Partners (LP) agency recalled how Ms. Arkuri was replaced in his visits to foreign business during his tenure as Mr. Janson Mayor, while some of the companies were said to be 'non-profit' at that time.

Earlier this week, Ryan Revis, arrested in Arisona's Lake Hawasu City, was accused of being 'Runner' for carrying pills for a box.
No one of them was directly charged for Miller's death, and none of them applied.
Walter, released in a drug case in 2005, has already been entitled to a five-month prison to violate the conditions of his freedom.
On Thursday, the well-known website, TMEST, the first prosecutors to deal with the case, have asked Walter to remain in jail till the trial period.
Nothing was immediately given to the telephone report sent to his lawyer.
On September 4, Pete was accused in the Federal Court and his prosecutor refused to comment.
Miller's replies have an extraordinary talk of his stress and drug use, which has made some of the greatest persons in the hip-hop fans.
Malcolm James Myrs McCarmick, a genuinely named Fitzburg, was in a two-year relationship with the singer Haryana Grand, which ended at the beginning of 2018.
After his death, the singer shared a favourite video about him in his Instagram and published the Teng You Next, in which he was deliberately mentioned.
Miller's death is one of the deaths of musicians associated with Obiyde's use in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, who was a Kidar artist in the 3 Tours Town Group, died in 2016, had Fenton and Hydrocodon in his body.
The article has been revised to show Walter's first edition of writings that Steven is not Stephen.
The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that if 650 grams of paracetamol pills are taken, it is not enough to take it bigger.
This absurd talk of the Chief Minister has created a lot of discussion in the state.
So far, more than a thousand people have been treated with dengue fever in Uttarakhand.
The opposition parties, including the Congress, have accused the government of not taking appropriate precautionary measures.
The Chief Minister of Uttarakhand said that the Government has taken adequate precautionary measures to reduce the impact. He visited the government hospitals and took care of those who have been treated with dengue.
If he had asked for well-being and had come, he had made a discussion that he had spoken of a suggestion.
In response to 500 grams of Parasitamal pill, 650 grams of Parasitamal pills, he said that dengue fever will flee even after taking rest.
He said that the health department officials are saying that those suffering from dengue fever should not take medicines on their own and come to the formal treatment.
The same Chief Minister had said that in the past few months, when the wind emanates from Pashumath, the breathing problem would be corrected.

The young man was desperate to disappear a vowel in this game.
The player will get a point whenever he takes the vowel from his hijacking.
I learned how to create sports in a boot camp.
Now, I am active in creating sports at the time of my fighting.
In March, his father joined him in a 5-day boot camp for children from 5 to 15 years of age.
The Camp organised by the Codefest International Institute provided opportunities for developing technologies such as child robotics and adventurous truth.
His father Passil Okbara is a Chineseer who has played a lot of mobile sports in the growing season of Passil.
I bought a tablet when he was 4 years old when he was always holding the phones to play.
He sported a lot of calendar and temporary run," said his father to CNN.
But after his father had planned to spend all the time in sports, he was hungry at his seventh age.
On that day, as usual, he was playing peacock in his tablet, so I was angry.
With anxiety, I told him, 'Are you always playing and others thinking of creating a game to play your game'
I was angry when I said it, but I do not know that he took it seriously," he added.
Since then, hungry was very interested in learning how to create sports, so that his parents bought him a fold and taught him the basis for creating sports.
Passil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, is named on the basis of what his sports is.
One of his sports is 'Muskido Mash' cookil Black Store.
Africa has the largest number of youth in the world, while innovation comes to the forefront of the continent.

While the largest technological companies such as Khugil and Myrosoft are increasing their investment in Africa, the Pacific and his colleagues are becoming the future goals.
Former Republican leader of North Carolina is going to acknowledge the crime for lies in the lunch investigation
The court documents submitted on Friday that the former chairman of the Carolina Republican Party will admit to the court that he lied to the Federal officials who are conducting a lunch inquiry into the leading political donor.
The Federal Court claims that Rabin Heys is going to admit the crime next Wednesday.
Heys has been told that he was aware of the fact that he had spoken to the FBI agents who had conducted a lunch inquiry in 2018 in a document based on the fact that Hays's lawyer has been prepared as part of the Criminal Approval Agreement and signed.
The Criminal Approval Agreement has been printed and he does not really mention any of the charges he acknowledged.
He was initially charged with accusations of inflammation, bribery and unreal information.
The state's Principal Insurance Regulatory Organisation, in response to the election campaign, accused the lawyers of the involvement of former parliamentarian Heys in the scheme of Special Concessional Insurance Officer.
The officer, Grack Lindburg and his colleagues, have been accused of trying to supplement State Insurance Commissioner Mike Case.
Lindberg is a founder of insurance and investment, who is one of the first political donors of the state in recent years, has contributed more than 5 million to the State and Federal candidates since 2016.
He thanked the Democrats even though he learnt on Republican policies and its politicians.
His lawyer did not respond to the email sent on Friday after hearing the opinion.
Carns Davis, a lawyer for Heys, did not respond to the email sent for further consideration on Friday.
In August 2018, when he told the FBI agents that he had never spoken about the staff in the State Insurance Sector, the court documents submitted on Friday that Heys had lied.
But Heys had actually spoken to the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's demand to change the workers within the regulatory agency.
Heys helped in calling for a meeting with Gaze, and Heys was directly consulting the regulator about lunch.
The Accusation issued in April accused Lindberg of seeking special concessions to his insurance industry and 2 million for Gase's 2020 re-election campaign.
The allegation also claims that Lyndberg's company had a demand for replacement of the department officer.
Case Federal, a Republican official, told the intelligence officials about trying to give lunch, helped him to prosecute.
There is no charge against him.
During an interaction with Lindberg and Gaze, a partner of Lindberg told Heys to send 25,000 to Gaze's re-election campaign.
Heys initially denied that it would be careful for sending so much amounts, but at the end of the talks, it was alleged to have reduced the denunciation.
Heys said, "Whatever you all want, we will do it."
"Okay, I want to do this to him."
The information officer for the Federal Prosecutor's Office has not responded to the e-mail to further information about the Criminal Approval Agreement.
To cover the number of aspirations as a test effort to improve the well-being of beneficiaries
Some of the beneficiaries of the world cannot see the desires, responses and video concepts for the second registration as the world's first test effort to improve the lives of the beneficiaries.
On the contrary, following such a test by Instagram in Australia in July, these desires will be personal and can only be seen.
This test will also be started in Australia, which will start on Friday.
The Australian Federal Policy Director Mia Carlic said that this change was based on the opinion of psychologists that health research and the number of aspirations is comparable to each other in the society.
Carlic said, "There are really positive ideas from many anti-criminal groups and psychological institutions working with us.
This is a replacing of the importance of the number, in fact focusing on the number of aspirations or protests, to focus on the quality of their interference and the quality of their records.
He said that it is expected not to be a competitor, but people will feel more proud to share on this platform.
Carlic asserted that the faculty-based industries would continue to achieve similar measurements and similar intents that they had already approached.
He said that such an early test cannot be done in Instagram, Australia, Canada, Brazil, New ealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
Nothing has been pointed out when this test can be done or whether this change will be made sustainable.
We have received some initial ideas from the public about this experience (instagram), but in this situation we are still learning and careful, he added.
Talking about the world's testing field, Carlic said that Australia has the most effective 'technological-specific beneficiaries' in Mukhmad and Instagram.
We believe that this will be the best country to have the best ideas of whether it is not a valuable experience for the people who use our services.
Every human being is grateful to the parents who have evolved and healthy.
There is no such sacrifice that the parents have done to develop a child.
It is a scripture that it is necessary to do all the necessary help to them during their life and continue to be thankful even after their lives.
They have set up a piturghan for that.
It will be mentioned in many names, Tharpanam, Pitharyama and Portuguese.
With gratitude, they need to do it with hardship on the day of the last month and say it 'Sirtha'.
The goddess is Thiruvananthapuram, the god of the southern Buldad is Vithukal, and he is ever five and six heads.'
The 'Thenbulathar' said in it is a concealed perspective.
Since the world of ancestors is in the southern direction, they will mention the world of their living as 'Chenbulum'.
However, it is necessary to visit Amavasa every month, even though it has been mentioned several days to perform.
Some people give Tai and Audi only in Amavasya.
If the father has not been worshipped till now, then it is very special to start it on the Mahalaya Amavas.
This is the moment that our ancestors will come to the entire earth.
During the period, sesame, water, pindum, rice, banana and food will be used.
It is a scripture that Pitur Devotees will bring them to the ancients.
Well, before coming to see their children in the world, we will return to Piturlok today.
In this day, bathing on the banks of the pilgrimage, praying and guiding them, the family will be able to live with riches and live livelihood.

The Chennai High Court asked the Government of Tamil Nadu why the government should not provide separate reservation in government medical colleges.
In Tamil Nadu, 207 seats have not been filled in allocation for overseas Indians in private medical colleges, they have been distributed to the respective colleges as administrators.
Thiran, who was filled with a formal analysis of these places, had filed a case in the Chennai High Court.
The case came to the trial at the session of judges Kribakaran and Velmurugan.
During the advocacy of the Indian Medical Council, Governor V. P. Raman argued that after three phases of analysis, the list will be sent to the respective college on the basis of 10 students in one place if there is empty space for the overseas Indians.
The list should be filled in the bottom of the college regulations.
But I don't know what was filled in the bottom of the list.
On behalf of the Government of Tamil Nadu, Additional Chief Prosecutor Arvind Khalin will be sent to the college related to Mat Tume.
The merit is to fill the empty places.
But they don't know how colleges are filling.
The Supreme Court has not issued any order in this regard.
Hence, he argued for the righteous order to fill the exclusive exclusion sites of the overseas Indians.
When the priest's lawyer Velmurugan argued in the petitioner, he said that 207 vacancies were sold to the lowest privilege.
Small judges, private schools, government medical colleges, why should the government schools not provide separate reservations in government medical colleges, not only send a list of vacant seats, should it not be reviewed on which basis it is filled up
Here the government doctors are paying less than the teachers.
This is an injustice to the doctors.
We are allowing 10 different medical colleges in Tamil Nadu to be representatives in this case.
Students involved in exclusive exclusive exclusion of exclusive Indians have ordered these colleges to submit the details of their values as a report by October 15.
Brothers are sentenced to life in the honour of Pakistan's social media famous Guantil Baloch.
Guantil Falloch, famous by his social media photographs, was murdered in July 2016.
Last Friday, Pakistan's social media famous uindala was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for his brothers for killing Baloch.
Famous for its attractive mobile phones in Pakistan, which was attracted by Western civilization, but deeply hatred on women, Baloch was necked and killed in the month of July.
His brother Mohammad Wasim was arrested.
He was unhappy about what he did, and said in a press conference a few days later that I had killed my sister, and the sister's behavior was 'very provocative.'
His lawyer Sardar Mohammad AFP said in a long-standing judgment that the court in the eastern city of Muldan had committed a life-crime sentence against his partymen.
He said he will be released in the High Court of Justice in the Council of Asia.
Earlier, Balochin's mother Anwar My hopes that her son will be released.
"He's a father.
She is my daughter, he is my son," he said.
The voices of Baloch's assassination internationally began to repeat and take action against the infection of a woman-slaughtered 'Goravak Kills' to breach the social regulations of the conservative society.
Women have been burnt, shot, whispered and throated to make their family foolish due to crimes like selecting their husband or selecting their own husband.
The murders were usually done by one of the close relatives.
They can apologize to the relatives of the victims according to Pakistan's uizas (Penal Money) and Dayat (Prevention) Act.
After three months of the murder of Paloch, the Parliament enacted a new legislation by compulsory punishment for the glorious murders.
However, the judge's self-decision of whether a murder was considered a honourable murder, which could lead the killers to another reason for the murder and forgive them.
At Baloch's assassination, his parents initially insisted that their son should not be forgiven and released.
But they said that we will lose their son and they should change their minds and forgive him.
However, due to international disappointment over the murder, the Pakistani government took a rare step to declare itself as a bargainer with the parents, and made progress in this case.
The fatigue of the Pakistani cricket team and the fascinating square day-to-day square square, are some of the familiar works of all.
This led to his protests and threats, but demonstrating themselves as a figure like Kim Cordasian, which was a brave and political activity for women's empowerment in a country where they were completely new, including young people.
The roots of Gaurav murders are in tribal social control, which are widespread across South Asia and men can be affected, but they are entitled to women's conduct.

I am aware that the youth who integrate Prabhakaran Revolution Seeds Mission.
Edison, one of them, shared his work with me.
The West Bengal elephant who died faintly
Animal Husbandry enthusiasts said, 'It was transformed into a broad gauge in 2004.
After that, most of the trains are being operated on this route.
Elephants' deaths have also increased since the increase in the number of trains.
This area is the path of elephants.
We took care of the railways that the speed of trains being operated in this area is causing the loss of lives in the accident of elephants.
Thereafter, trains were ordered to run at a low speed in the region.
Due to this, accidents have also been reduced.
Now the trains are being operated at a fast pace in the region.
We are asking for construction of penalties in other areas.'
Talking about this, the North Eastern Railway Officers said, "There is a 15 km rail route in the forest area.
While crossing this area, it has been ordered to run the trains gradually.
The order is to gradually run the trains for 24 hours.
Continuous research is underway in the forest area.
Discussions are also going on to reduce the speed of trains.'
A three-member team has been set up to review the operation of trains in the region.
The area of the accident was 4.5 degrees curved.
He is being treated by a train-driven logo filet.
Social enthusiasiastics have said that in the last one year, there has been no payment of mortgage assistance to pregnant women in Tamil Nadu.
Dr. Muktilakshmi Reddy Maternity Assistance Scheme was launched to benefit the poor pregnant women from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu.
Within 12 weeks of pregnancy, details of Aadhaar card and Bank Account Number are given to rural and urban recipients and Rs.
Thereafter, 4,000 will be provided in the 2nd instrument after the completion of the 4th month.
After the completion of the delivery in the government hospital, a total of Rs. 4,000 will be provided to the children during the period of vaccination and Rs. 2,000 will be provided after the completion of 9 months of the vaccination.
Similarly, during pregnancy, nutritional nutritious substances including iron tonics, dry fenugreeks, protein biscuits, ghee, alpentasol pills, cucumber pieces are provided to improve the health of women.
This programme has been implemented to promote pregnant women and their children with health.
The scheme was very beneficial for the poor and middle class pregnant women.
Over the last one year, maternity assistance to pregnant women has been stopped without being provided regularly.
In this regard, social enthusiastics said, 'The 18,000 maternal assistance provided by the Department of Public Welfare and Family Welfare to pregnant women has not been provided for more than 13 months.
This has affected the safety of mother and child during maternity.
There is a situation of buying loans for the maintenance of children.
As only nutritional nutritious subsidies have been provided, no subsidies have been issued in the bank account till date.
In this regard, the Central Government has not yet provided the first instruction amount to be given to the Health Department officials.
The remaining Rs. 16,000 will be deposited in the bank account after the Central Government has paid Rs. 2,000 for the first time.
However, it is questionable whether the Tamil Nadu government has regularly registered the applications for pregnant women seeking maternity assistance.
Hence, the government should take the current bonds to provide immediate maternity assistance for more than a year.'

Ministers insurgency-the-son protests against the police anson for a compromise with Brussels by reducing Brexit demands
There is a growing fear among the top officials around the Prime Minister that the time for major concessions has been decreasing, just three weeks for the multilateral summit of European leaders.
Ministries rebelled against the police anson to reduce their Brexit demands and enter into an agreement with the European Union.
As Brussels said Mr. Janson's alternative arrangements are unable to function, there has been an obstacle in the discussion on a new customs system in exchange for Irish Baxtop.
Senior ministers, other than the European Union Power Brokers, headed by Angela Merkel, Germany, will give the last time agreement on Bextop to the Tori leader who is ready to fight.
The Sun's three different cabinet ministers and all of them are preparing to oppose him after the annual conference of the Tori Party in Manchester next week.
With the threat of no contract, the EU and senior aider, Tominique Commings, will demand him to abandon the planned 'ruthless' strategy and insist on accepting the last time concession of the European Union.
A minister said that the Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday was 'time to abolish' and said, "October 31, we have only one way to make an agreement.
At the bottom, we can never get the number, and they are against us.
Now the Prime Minister should be twisted and taken as possible.
The ruthlessness does not take place, the committee's plan has clearly emerged.
We can't fight everywhere.
The second Cabinet Minister is committed to tell Mr. Janshan that the former Prime Minister Teresa should try to implement the agreement on May, if all others are created.
The senior minister added, "I will ask the police to put forward Teresa's agreement under the supervision.
Now it has enough numbers, everybody is trying to complete it.
If we insist on sustaining this, everything was completed to the police and all of us were completed.
Sir John Major accused the police of not giving importance to the talks.
In a familiar conversation, the former Tori leader said, "The Prime Minister wants us to enter into an agreement with Europe.
But we cannot see the creation of an agreement with Brussels.
On the contrary, we see the rubbing of eggs in Scotland, testing of eggs in Wells, and negotiating with the people in the streets - the world will see all as the election campaign is already in full swing.'
The Prime Minister's spokesman acknowledged that 'No one should imagine, we have to go a long way to achieve the contract,' and said that the contract is far away.
When there is no agreement, the Pen Act, which enforces a three-month delay, drives faster reduction in our negotiations in Brussels.
"There is no doubt that it prevents our dialogue, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are constantly trying to achieve progress due to the law," he said.
Frexit Secretary Stephen Parkle is going back to Brussels today for further talks with the EU's Michael Pernia.
They will suggest a document on how all Ireland regions are possible for food and livestock.

Television owners have told him that he could never be an event cluster because of his culmination of Clasco.
He recalled that after returning 35 years in the broadcasting sector, Kelly, 59, had realized the 'Mecca film' before being on the screen.
He said I was very filmed as I was 25 years old.
I worked as a researcher in BBC Scotland and said that my employer could never enter the television because of my elevation of Clasco.
Before I assumed office in Clasco, I went to London to see all the television teams and broadcasts.
At that time, I would not forget that both on Timond and Mike Morris had spoken to the famous Bet Davis.
I couldn't believe that I was in the same room as one of the greatest popularities.
I realized that this is the place I wanted to be.
In Scotland, Kelly started his life as a local newspaper in East Cilbridge and was a Scotland reporter of AM TV in 1994.
He started distributing programmes like GMTV, ITV Brackfast and Tabric and then inaugurated the morning event Lauren, which was named after him.
He will commemorate his 35th anniversary with a special event to remember his forgotten moments and interviews.

You must be honest and true.
Prepare, be more enthusiastic and interested in you.
Kelly recalled his heartfelt news collections, saying the Dunflain massacre was 'very difficult'.
On the next day of the brutal murder of fifteen children and their teachers, I do not know that many families of those killed or injured children were watching the event.
One of those mothers, who betrayed her five-year-old girl Johnna, wanted to meet me personally, and we spoke at her house for hours.
As we continue our relationship, I went to Jonnah's last chamber, since then I continue to be friends.
Immediately after her daughter lost in 2007, she interacted with Gate and Kerry McCan and gave a "maximum pain" and really appreciated her courage and commitment.
The pain that had not been known for their foolish daughters, and the thoughts that had to bear in online.
I'm sorry for them.

imbabwe: Singa scared of being stuck
A senior government official said that Tunan-President Constantino Sivenga denied the opportunity of former President Robert Caucabe to be president at the time of the revolution, fearing that it would be an envelope to empower the military to seize the regime in November 2017.
Last week, imbabwe Independent said, Mugabe told Sivanga to accept the post of President following talks between him and the military during the revolution.
A senior government official, however, said in the social media that Shivenga was unable to deny this opportunity because of fear, and was really able to know the plan of the Mugabee to use to prove to the world leaders and the African Union (AU) leaders that he had actually lost his position in the revolution.
The 37-year-old regime of imbabwe was ready to hand over power to Sivenga, but Jamwanda 2, asserted by government officials that President Amarson Nanga was a senior government official of the office of the presidential office and the cabinet office that he would not leave.
The government officials said that Mugabe had reached Sivanga by one of his envoys, who felt power from his hands.
According to the senior government official, there were three individuals in the midst of the leadership of the military bureaucracy and the retired former president.
The official said the negotiators would include President's spokesman George Saramba, Aaron Nebera, the then chairman of the Central Intelligence Organization and Bishop Cleric Fidelis Mukonori, the Roman Federation.
He was another person in the talks after being sent separately by the former Governor of the imbabwe Reserve Bank, Jidian Gono Mugabe, to give him the chance of presidential post to imbabwe Defence Force (ISTF).
While describing Africa as a symbol of death, he sought the intervention of other African leaders, at the same time attempted to ruin the African Union not to recognize the operation of the military.
The contemporary (Mukabe) did not choose the then CDF (General of Defence Forces) as president.
The official (Jamwanda) wrote, 'It was an unbelievable attempt to rectify the rapid advancing climate and depressed a part of the missing presidential family.'
But there was a little political atmosphere, the disappearing president believed that it would correct the situation in the least diplomatic system.
This change would have confronted them with the standpoint of the African Union on the Revolutions, not deteriorating the constitutional order and recalling the promises of the commanders to deteriorate.
The disappearing president (Mukabe) believed that the then CDF (Sivenga) would be in the trunk, which would ensure that the words of the commanders were not deteriorating the constitution.
The African Union, which was very confused to see the entire situation, on the basis of its theoretical approach to revolutions, would have been convinced that it would have been called a revolution without other means, so that there was a need for military intervention.
Thus, the opportunity was given to me in a calculation manner.
Moreover, officials said that Mugabe had taken this action when he felt that the security forces were not prepared to defend themselves.
They said the camp was forced to write a resignation letter because the army warned him of the danger to be killed like a cabbage.
Military chiefs told him that civilians would not protect him from them if they marched to his flu-rupe settlement.
At that time, he had two desires to defend his family and prove that the army was holding the regime.'
The then CDF and the General (Such) were well understood.
The senior government official said that the messenger who brought the unbelievable news - through a powerful joy - Visu Tiri vemakwapa-Makwapa (We have not shown anybody, i.e. militia, we are not politicians or those in political competition.
Government officials say that the military leaders in the region do not have their intentions to remove the camp, through their men in imbabwe, but the military has informed that the military should take care of the 'criminals' around him.
In view of the continuation of the revolution and regime, the camp tried to use the same strategy to repeat Nangakwa, who had been asylum in South Africa for some time.
Apart from negotiating with the military, Mugabe demanded help from the region.
South Africa - not only because of its economic and regional strength, but also because the then President Jacob uma refused to intervene because of the SATC president - but as the consistent threat from the back, the South African forces had entered the camp's house, made it clear that they would immediately reach Harare.
'The new and African leaders didn't want it,' the news source told Independent.

'The threats to the Corporate War and the increasing taxes are not supposed to solve the problem,' she said on the other business issues with Washington.
China is a consolidated economy with a comprehensive industrial organisation, a holistic industrial alliance, a broader market and a strong economic regime.
The Commerce Wars will never weaken it, he added.
China is convinced that it can combat difficulties and transform barriers into steps and create a new world.

The US cannot control China, and there is no chance to stop China's growth.
The prevention and suppression of other countries will not force the US to take domestic problems abroad.

Tourist places are very dirty .
The biggest contribution to the Australian economy of 21.9 billion every year is the Sydney Port surrounded by Opera House, Circular uay, Luna Parks and a symbolic port bridge.
But it is a bitter fact that it is below the bridge.
The famous port of Sydney is one of the most dirty waterways in the country, in which 15 Olympic swimming ponds are collected every year.
This statistics, the most attractive of the tourists, makes this place one of the most dirty places.
According to a new video known as the Sydney Port and below, cigarette pieces, plastic pieces and bottles, deserted shoes and clothing and dead animals in the water surrounding Australia's most famous city reach the port via rainwater.
However, plastic plays an important role in blocking our waterways.
Dr. Ketherin Tafran, Deputy Director, Sydney Port Research Programme, said, "I am a fool."
It looks nice to see, but it is one of the most transformed and dirty toilets in our beaches.
Every hour, about 1560 kilometres of plastics come in our waterways, most of them enter the port through rainwater drains.
Dr. Tafran said that the port is in a very bad condition following a few incidents of heavy rains.
One-third of these wastes comes through rainwater.
However, while 70 percent of the plastics in the sea reach the beach, the problem of the Sydney Port is largely below the surface like a snowball.
According to Richard Nicholas, the owner of the Manli Division Centre, Richard Nicholas, the owner of the Manli Division Centre, he and his team personally took out 500 kg of plastic every year and said, 'If you go below the water and spend time.'
If it be known to many, they shall be astonished.
Most... we find half of the plastic bags.
The rest will be at least 50 percent of plastic.
When you see the port, it looks very beautiful, but people don't believe that all these plastics and wastes are below its surface.
Ocean Protected Sub-Corporate and Managing Director Germany Praoon said that both local and tourists are the only way to reduce the amount of plastic and waste to our waterways.
It should start from capital, he added.
It should be more aware that we should reduce the level of plastics and renew it well, and that the movement within our drains will finally reach the sea.
If we destroy the sea, we are going to destroy ourselves because 50 percent of our breathing oxygen comes from the sea.
It sucks 30 percent of carbon typical and food resources.
But we can fix this port and bring it to its ancient position, it is very easy.
If we destroy the sea, we destroy ourselves.

Dosmanian temples can be guided to cure cancer .
Researchers have discovered a turning point in the diagnosis of the Dosmanian Temples to cure cancer.
Medical researchers have found how some cancer cells hide themselves .
Researchers discovered that this procedure is happening in Dasmanian temples and humans as well .
This innovation is expected to give new methods of treatment to cancer patients .
Does Dasmanian Davels and humans have common
No eye cancer cells.
Researchers, including those from Melbourne's Peter Mechelum Cancer Centre, have initiated an innovation that helps in creating a revolution in the treatment of a variety of cancers.
It may be the main feature of the destruction of the Dasmanian Davids that threatens the future.
The study discovered a group of proteins, BRC2, and concealed themselves and discovered the method of concealing some of the cancer cells in humans and in the organisms, to prevent a trauma from a caution to attack cancer.
This may be one of the biggest challenges in the treatment of lung cancer, neuroplastoma and mercel cells.
Peter Make researcher Mark Dason told AAB that in a few days, we can be able to reverse the process to patients who are resisting the anti-immune system.
Cancer cells can be diagnosed by the immune system by changing the objectives of existing treatment to activate MHH proteins.
Prof. Dasan said that it is possible for neural cancer patients to have long-term benefits.
It is one of the most diseases in the world.
We will be able to treat it in a better way.
Researchers believe that this innovation can be ultimately used in the mouth tumors of the Dasmanian television to prevent the detection of cancer cells.
Prof. Dason said that the same process is exactly remarkable for humans and for the Dasmanian David Cancer.
Till now, it was very difficult to treat the cancer tumors in the Dasmanian temple.
But if the drugs that can be used in humans can also be used by the Dasmanian television, it can help in controlling the disease.'

Scientists have shouted about the roaming of the largest satellite.
Scientists are surprised to find a solar family, which is 30 light years away from the earth, surrounding the radical star Red Twarf, a big satellite like Thursday, which challenges the present understanding of the creation of the satellite.
The art form of GJ 3512B, the largest gas satellite surrounding Red Twaff, the most nutritious star, released on September 26, 2019.
Normally the stars will be bigger than the largest planets surrounding them.
But in the event, researchers said that the star and the goll have no major differences.
While the GJ 3512 star is 12 at the level of our sun, the weight of the surrounding winter will be at least half of the weight of the greatest illness of our solar family.
He headed the research published in the Science Journal, Carlos Morales, an aerialist at the Cadolonia Space Research Institute, Spain, said this is a very surprising thing.
This innovation was surprising when the ideals of creating small satellites like earth and small neptunes are usually possessed.
In this, we have discovered a small star surrounding the largest gas satellite on Thursday," he added.
Like Thursday, the excessively gas-made satellite was used to use a vision in the Caller Altozene laboratory in Spain.
It is surrounding its star in its length for 204 days.
Red Dwarves are small and low temperature in the surface.
GJ 3512 is not only smaller than our sun, but is only 35 percent bigger than Thursday, which is slightly comparable to a larger pool.
They will show less energy and slightly cooler than the sun, and their surface temperature will be less than 3800 (degree) Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit,3,527 Celsius).
That's why they have red colors," said Morals.
Morales said that as the source of a second satellite roaming the star, a third satellite might have been swallowed from the star family in the past, describing the lengthy path of that corner like Thursday.
Satellites are also formed from the same layer of gas and dust in the midst of the dust that produces their surrounding stars.
According to the premier model for the creation of satellites, the geography of this black pepper initially generates from the solid pieces of the layer leads to an emergence from the surrounding gas.
This can be explained as an unstable geography, a contrary to this case.
In this event, the proto plantary layer surrounding the young star would be slightly bigger and colder than expected.
This makes the layer unstable, causing some dense areas to appear.
They can grow up to the dispersion of these pieces, which creates a planet.
In Tripura, the order issued by the High Court of the State to ban the sacrifice of sheep and sheep in the temples is very much discussed.
The state government has stated in the court that Tripura's promise was to be violated while joining India in 1949.

The Agreement was signed by the then Tripura Maharani Kanchan Prabha Devi and Governor General of India.
The main feature of the Agreement is that the Government of Tripura will continue to provide financial assistance to traditional worships for 14 temples including the famous Tripura Sundari Temple.
A sheep was sacrificed in Tripura Sundari temple.
The government is also providing financial assistance to this.
This should not be changed is the key component of the Connectivity Agreement with India.
In contrast to this, the government continued the public interest case in the Tripura High Court, saying that the sacrificing of the goats and the sacrificing of the goats is the heart of the Hindus.
The Division Bench Judges Sanjay Karol and Arindam Loth, who tried the case, imposed a chaotic ban on sacrificing sheep at religious places in Tripura.
The court also ordered that the government should not help in the sacrifice of such sheep.
Further, the court has sent notices to all district magistrates and police observers to respond to this matter.
At the same time, the court has directed that the temples should not be sacrificed except sheep and sheep, and to monitor the CCDV cameras in all the temples.
Now the State Government is going to appeal to the Supreme Court against this order of Tripura High Court.
Indicating that the Tripura High Court has rejected its argument that it should not violate the promise made when it joined India in 1949, the State Government has been appealing to the Supreme Court.

State Family Secretaries: Repeated travellers and surprising guests released on Royal Aircraft
As part of their state duties, the royal family must travel hundreds around the world in their lifetime.
Generally, it is easy to facilitate this, a single plane to connect the family of the royal family all over the world for important events and initiatives.
It is not surprising that there are individual concessions because of a separate plane.
With no need to wait in the long security sequences and regulation of the number of bags, it appears that the royal family can carry any guest they want - including some unexpected travellers.
According to the recently released channel 5 documentary, Rani and Prince Philip do not have frequent travellers on the Royal plane.
During the Rail Aircraft Ceremony, he said that many animals along with the queen's airplane will often be guests.
Bab Shilts said that along with our vital royal families, some important royal family dogs can also come to travel sometimes.
It is not surprising that the queen, known for the depth of the dogs of Carkis, called her lovely travellers to travel with her.
It is said that Elisabet Rani had loved four-four animals since young age and had more than 30 cargo dogs since her hair was queen.
In 2007, he was believed to have five cargis dogs Mandi, Emma, Linnet, Villo and Holi.
There were five cakes of Spanish dogs, Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, and four dentist-carki mixed dogs like Seder, Berry, Walkan and Kendi.
Employees at the Royal Aircraft will be employed comfortably.
Before the dogs climbed the plane, the workers' household members could see the dogs assembled to the plains and drive them to spend.
I am glad to say that there was no accident at any time.
The event also highlighted the surprising quantity of the well-known commodities that the queen was taking to work.
During his 44,000 miles of Commonwealth tour in 1953, the queen's property had reached 12 tons.
If you look at it, it's like the weight of two big elephants.
However, the queen is not the only one who is attracted to clothes.
Cambridge Gomas said they had their own personal desires to carry their modern clothes - there is a rumour that their clothes would have been allotted one seat for each.

In the first few months of the White House, I was worried that my daughters had a special beginning in the school and ensured that they get new friends.
I think it was right and good.

Despite the complaints related to behavior, the trump hotel has a liquor license .
The Washington Drugs Control Board rejected the demand for revision of its liquor licensing due to the conduct of Washington (AP) Local Trop International Hotel Owners.
The organisation dismissed the fugitive on Wednesday as three ministers, two executive judges and two Rabis, most of whom lived in the province or had no property in the province.
This is the second time the Washington Post claims complainants to abrogate the hotel's liquor licence in the name of the provincial legislation that claims those who apply for the licence must be 'good conduct'.
Referring to the allegations and fraudulent methods of the attack, President Donald Trump said that the law was violated in the early hours of the summer.
Since it was already awarded the license, it was rejected.
The second complaint was made following the renewal of the license.
Overseas Indians who are not filled in private medical colleges in Tamil Nadu are not filled with 207 seats, which are being provided to the respective colleges as administrative allocations.
Thiran, who was from Kovi, had filed a case in the Chennai High Court through a formal analysis of these places.
The case was re-examined at the session of Judges Kribakaran and Well.
At the same time, the prosecutor of the Indian Medical Council said, 'After three phases of analysis, the list will be sent to one place at the rate of 10 students.
But it is not known whether it was filled on the basis of the list.'

In the petitioner's case, the priest accused the lawyer of '207 seats have been sold to the lowest.'
A report shows that the Cleveland Police, which is corrupt, has been dragged worstly - The Sun
Analysts have raided the corruption-ridden police station of Britain as a bad police.
A report estimated that the Cleveland Police is unsuccessful in all matters.
HM-in-Constructor Fil Gomle says that the Cleveland Police has 'specificly deteriorated.'
Now new appeals are coming to dissolve this force, which has seen five chief guards in six years.
The report states that it fails in attempts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the victims.
There is a significant deterioration after our pre-examination," says HM-in-Constructor Fil Gomle.
The Chief Guard, Mikewelle, left in January within a year when he faced 'discriminate' but unprecedented charges of his conduct.
Assisting Chief Guard, Atrien Roberts, was removed after being arrested on the grounds of doubts about the worst act.
Last year, deputy analyst Simon Horud appeared before a group of misbehavior to prepare allies for sexual intercourse.
He left the army.
TES WALLI's Torry Mayor Ben Hauchen said, 'It's an official proof of the dissolution of this force.
Now the time has come to intervene in the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Principal Police Richard Luis said, "I am fully congratulated to take forward initiatives and guide change.
Nancy Pelosi: William Bar has become 'Pokri', supposed to be prosecuted without interruption.
You never know where we're going next.
I think we are now engaged in covering the coverage and it may take some time to investigate," said Pelosi in an interview with the CNN on Capital Hill.
They will do the work done by them following the realities and the time to find out the truth, he added.
The White House's White House published this week that Trump had told Ukraine President Volodimir Selensky to examine former Vice-President Joe Piten, a 2020 candidate and the son of Piten.
In this regard, the telephone dump showed Selensky's telephone call to work in collaboration with Bar and his personal prosecutor Rudy Guliani.
Trump denied that he did nothing wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN said that the Justice Department had first warned the National Security Prosecutors about the complaint of publication of a secret of Ukraine-related trumpet one week before regular recommendations.
After receiving the suggestion received from the intelligence department officials, the judiciary decided that there was no need for a criminal inquiry into the campaign for Trop's phone call.
Asked whether to testify, Pelosy said that the intelligence committee would decide on Friday to call anyone as witness.
He added that he believes that the sight has become a robber.
He has been doing this for a long time.
Pelosi recalled the drump on his Attorney General in July's call with the Ukraine chairman and said, 'This is because of which all these are mentioned.'
He is keen to take decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi said he was 'very concerned' about the information sources of the secret published, and attacked them on Thursday as fools, and presented the drump that the fools were held in different ways at that time.
I think the President's responsibilities breached the irresponsibilities and it is dangerous.
In showing the mistakes in our government - publishers have a key role in displaying secrets, Pelosy said, 'The President's saying about those who give information to the secret publishers is intensely doubting the government's honesty.'
On Tuesday, Pelosy carried out a historic work to announce a formal summon inquiry into allegations that he tried to put pressure on a foreign leader for political profit.
The telephone call was incorporated in a complaint to the public on Thursday and one accused the telephone of misusing its power in the coming elections of 2020.
He accused the White House lawyers of having told officials to remove the letter copy of the phone call from a computer that stores the copy of the phone and place them in a private organisation for secret information.
Christian Pentech: Christian Palace Streker opposes the drive barrier due to high speed
The premiere League is looking forward to the possibility of driving Christian Pentech because he was caught twice a month.

Kofi Manu is concerned about the formation of a team of researchers.
Mr. Kofi Manu, a Foot Administrator and Sekondi Hazakas official, expressed concern over the formation of a review committee for the upcoming Cana Foot Association (GFA) elections.
The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Frank Davis, questioned the inclusion and said he was not happy to join.
In an interview to the GNA Sports, he said that he suspects whether the chairman of the team will be justified as he can benefit from the results of the research process.
The Survey Committee must have intermediate persons from outside without any interface with any member and have already been unavailable.
For instance, Mr. Davis was signed as a prosecutor for writing to Osai Vaku Balmar on a fee of 10.
He is also a well-known Olympic supporter.
He should not be allowed to continue in the research team for these two reasons because of his benefit," he argued.
Mr. Manu, a director of Olympics, told Mr. Fred Papo that if he appears before the group, he would be contradictory to the contact with the Club and suggested that if Mr. Palmer appears before the team, there would be discrimination and distinction.
After assuming office at a function held at the GFA Secretariat in Agra on September 19, the members of the committee are expected to start the first work yesterday and end on October 4.
The Committee will be headed by Mr. Frank Davis, CEO and Legislator, Ms. Marian Porner and Imanuel Dharwa.
Marketing and Industrial Administrator Mr. Regnald Larya and Sports Administrator and Legalist Mr. Richard Abokevi will be other members.
As Rupa Gurunath was elected president of the Cricket Association of Tamil Nadu, it is said that the son of former minister Ponmukhi had tried to take the post.
Various reforms are being made in the Indian Cricket Board and State Cricket Associations as per the recommendations of the Lotha Committee.
The recommendations of the Lotha Committee include one of the Cricket Associations cannot continue to remain in office more than two times, and those above 70 years of age cannot come to office.
Accordingly, those who were already in office in the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association were unable to go to office.
There was an ecosystem to choose new people.
Asok Sikamani, son of Dighu, former minister Ponmukhi, has moved to take over as the president of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, but it is said that India's cements has broken the attempt.
So, Ashok Sikamani has taken over the post of Vice President.
He is a child welfare hospital in Chennai KK and is the younger son of Ponmukhi.
Asok Sikamani was very interested in cricket from school.
Everything was engaged in an attempt to join the Indian team at a stage.
India's cements Cheenivasan is the reason why the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association is currently elected uncompetitive president and executives.
If it had been a competition, Ponamuni's son Ashok Sikamani would have duffed the daughter Rupa.
Asoka Sikamani may be the Vice-President of the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, he would relax after he had spoken peace in the Senavasan side.
The case is to be handed over to the Archaeological Department of Tamilnadu in the field of Mysore inscription.
The Chennai High Court on Wednesday ordered Madurai to respond to the activities taken to protect and revive the archaeological miracles from 27 Tamilnadu inscriptions.
Mani Charan filed by Madurai: In the State of Madurai, there is an inscription under the control of the Central Archaeological Department in Mysore.
There are ancient calves and historical treasures in India.
Inside the Tamil inscriptions, the lessons are the evidence of the scientific determination of the history of Tamils.
Further, the lessons of Tamil Nadu inscriptions have been documented.
In this context, when the inscription office in Mysore was shifted from the old building to the new building, most of the old Tamil inscriptions were damaged.
The inscriptions and historical documents should be maintained in a systematic manner and published as books.
However, the documents related to Tamil Nadu, which were whispered in Mysore, were not regularly protected.
Thus, the history and tradition of Tamils is unaware of the future generations.
Hence, he said that the Tamil inscriptions in Mysore area should be ordered to be handed over to Tamilnadu television department.
On Wednesday, he came to Visa at the session with Shivajanam and R. Tarani.
The judges, at the same time, agreed on 22nd October by the Central Archaeology Department to respond to the process of preserving and renewing the archaeological signs taken from Tamil Nadu inscriptions.
Appeals for a single drive against Australia
Jastein Tippuch says that the time has come to show 'thinness' in the competition against the Australian team, which will determine the Wheels summit in the World Cup.
The anti-Australian victory will enable them to wear the most possible victories to win the T-Private and ensure the possibility of confrontation with France or Argentina.
But in the last 15 meetings, if the Australian team wins the Whales team for the 14th time, it will drive Tipurich and the team into conflict with the UK for the last eight places.
'There is nothing hidden in this, and the two teams will win and try to take the first in the class,' he said.
In the past, some of the outcomes were difficult, but in the past, they (Australia) won a victory sweet.
I think they will be intense thinking about killing us again, while we want to ensure that another success is achieved.
We know that it is going to be an important competition before coming here.
Now we have come here and the time has come to showcase the talent.
The WALS team has won only one victory against Australia, New ealand or South African teams in the history of the World Cup - which won 32 years ago when Australians won the third position competition.
Overall, only seven successes have been achieved in 41 attempts against three Southern Jambans under Chief Trainer Warren Cathland.
Wells halted the ongoing defeat in 13-Test competitions against Australia last November, one of the rest of the 9-6 winners in the Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.
When asked if there was no heartbreak before that victory, he said that it was difficult to say it.
Those competitions were very difficult, perhaps... people might think that there was some psychological constraints.
At the end of the last competition, we left about 15 points, so it would be difficult to see the points.'
As Wells wins, the struggle with Australia's renowned Financial Twins Michael Hooper and David Bokak will be important.
He knows exactly what is going to happen because of the 67-time-driven Tripurich fighting these two soldiers in many earlier competitions.
He said these seven are totally world class heroes.
You are always aware that the competition will be difficult when fighting with world-class backwards.
Both of them are constantly the best heroes in the world.
You know what kind of competition you are going to face.
One of the best heroes in the world to save the ball, Bokak, Michael, is a slightly attacker, who is in the right place at the right time.
You must challenge yourself to fight with the world's best soldiers rather than fighting with those who did not play properly.
You would like to play against the best heroes, and when you play against these two soldiers, you should be with the best lamb.
I don't say that the competition to be held on Sunday has ended, but this is an important competition for us in this world cup.
The motivation of the film is an important part of it.
If you continue to play well and express your best practice then it will be difficult to kill you.
Rainfall at sea level drowning at Chennai Sea
The Inter-Governmental Committee on Climate Change (IBCC) has warned that 4 Indian coastal towns of Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai are surrounding the ocean.
IBCC, which reviewed the climate change of INA, has released the Survey.
In this, at the end of this century, the sea water will melt the Himalayas at a rapid pace.
This will lead to severe ocean drowning in four cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai.
At the same time, many parts of North India will face severe water shortage.
The sea level is growing faster than before.
This will affect 1. 4 billion people worldwide in 2100.
In India, not only 4 coastal cities but also 45 ports worldwide, up to 50 cm, sea level rises and drowns in the floods.
Due to the increase in danger every year, nails and small islands on the lower coast are in severe danger.
Moreover, if necessary action is not taken to reduce global warming, the temperature of the sea will increase and the destruction of marine creatures.
The worldwide seafood will not go away.
There is also an opportunity to generate large quantity of cyclone marks.
The temperature of the ocean has doubled from 1982 to 2016.
Thus, the Survey points out.
Estenters Spilers: Ben kisses Kalam after Witney's shock
The tension between Kallam Have and Ben Mitchell will once again erupt in the estents, as Witney Dean (Shona McCarthy) picked up the shocking waste and regained to his prisoner.
Whether the relationship between them is bleak or the situation of anger will both mourn
Helped the footsteps to save Ben's life and helped Baby Beaya, and he and Pen were gradually linked to the idea of going to Tatting, while Kallam recently said that Pen was sweet to see his weak and soft side.
Tonight, Witney is returning from a holiday in a special state than he had left.
It is clear that the distressed person who came to his marriage and his husband had disappointed himself, who had left the Weford, had given him the best benefit.
When he comes home, his mind joins Kallam.
But soon, a fact that he reveals is deteriorating the inside of the filth.
J. Mitchell (Jemy Parthvik) is worried about Kallam's bad activity and he started drinking again in ueen Wick Pap.
He goes to Pen and fights all that he had done in accusations with him.
The disappointment of Kalam becomes uncontrollable because Pen remains calm and accepts the passion of foot and kisses him long before that.
But after that, what will they go towards
The couple's attempt to go to Tatting next week, but Ben's intense thinking about its earlier relations is a threat to smash all efforts and efforts to do that.
But after demonstrating to his Homophobic father, Kallam, who has a new self-confidence, is determined to fight for one of his own.
On September 27, at 8.30 pm, the triumph is scheduled to be shown in the Estentres series on BBC-On.
The White House has been distressed to know what is the footprint of the postponement .
On Thursday, White House officials deciding how to face the renewed endeavour of the Democrats for postponement, explained that the situation has been 'for the past one week' because there is no solution to this new problem.
A person close to the White House said the accusations of publication of secrets could affect the President and his surroundings seriously, as it looks like a 'disturbance, uncomfort and anxiety' in the West.
The Prime Minister said that there is an unbelievable atmosphere where there is nothing.
The White House officials are uncertainly unaware of what to do, not because there is no clear plan for the situation, but because the way the President used in the past to avoid the discussions is not useful: 'It does not seem to be a matter of disappearance after the next news comes.'
Another person, who was aware of these suggestions, said that the White House has been shocked and the chances of the President to retaliate and go to an inappropriate level are increasing.
While the pressure on the President is expected to increase every day during the summit inquiry, some around the president would be more inspired.
It instigates anxiety that the trend of the trumpet could become even more calculated and unexpectedly resist - both in the election year and in both positions of the president and political.
In confronting the unprecedented threat to his presidential post, Robert Muller's revival of the strategy he had efficiently seen during the Russian intelligence, turned into a safeguard from the trump attack.
The Democrats and presidential candidate Joe Piten attempted to lose his demand for helping the Ukraine president in the investigation of his political opponents through the reversal of the actions of the Democratic Party and the secretary of the secret and the bleaching of the confidence of the one-sided person.
However, as many in the White House had experienced Mullar intelligence, the helpers and advisers said that this time they had started feeling differently.
On Wednesday, a press conference was held in the name of President, a man who knew about the situation that he had failed.
They said that Drump, pleased with questions about Russian intelligence, appeared as if there was no mood to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the Chancellor's allies believe that it can be reduced by arguing that the secret publisher was not directly aware of the problem telephone calls between Trump and Ukraine President Volodimir Selenski.
Moreover, his truth inspires believers to protect him that the President has been in a break as he is often walking.
But one closest to the White House, he said that the basic recognition points of the president are already very high, and the recognition of the new ones is not easy for the postponement.
In the next four months, there is no benefit in paying attention to the post of President, particularly if it dismantles his legislature programmes and drives into a headline message.
Other parties argue that the posting may help the president and do not fully know how his response would be.
The worrisome White House officials are looking for advisors to help in replacing the postponement.
Speaking about the plans, the Prime Minister said that while efforts are still in the initial stages, efforts such as the war room will be beneficial or in what form it will be.
The person said that a clear precedent was the acceptance of the integrated legislative and communication strategy to oppose the public's support against the publication of the secret report and the speed of the Democratic Democrats' postponement efforts.
Foreign Minister Mike Pambio and Finance Minister Steve Nuchin said that the Ukraine president would not be able to repeat the call of Trump was regretted that there was no way other than the release of the document after 48 hours and the long-term vision was unconscious.
It is expected that Robert Muller's investigation, speaking only through his accusations, would be more pressurized than at the time of the investigation, and a person who is expected to be involved in creating an answer to the postponement, said Gorre Levandosky, former propaganda manager of Trumpf Bit Bul.
But for such an attempt, Ency News told Levandosky that it was not real that he was the leader.
He said, "I have done everything I have done for the past five years to support the officer and his plan, but I have not consulted with the President to join a team to oppose a foolish posting effort.
J Chekulo, who is an external prosecutor of Trump from the Muller trial, is also involved in the postponement efforts.
When NC News interacted with his ideas, he said, "We will deal with matters whenever it is possible."
As Emmat Flot, who was working during Clinton's dissolution, guided by the end of the Muller's trial, the White House's current legal adviser has no such experience, the lawyer, who is experienced in the dissolution inquiry, is no longer in the White House.
A person acquainted with the White House's strategy that no officers were near the integration of all or building war rooms - but acknowledged that there was a need for an integrated, collaborative response and a political struggle.
It is reported in the Weather Report published this morning that heavy rains in most parts of the country may occur in the evening.

Devin News blames Democrats for asking for 'Trump's Nirvana films
It is obvious that the investigation of President Donald Trump was not possible to be held by Parliamentarian Devin News (R-Calif).
He blamed the Democrats for attempting to get the president's rescue films to defend him on Thursday.
News, chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence Committee, accused the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Piten and his son of drumping Ukraine's help in conducting an inquiry.
He said that the Democrats preferred to see President's rescue photographs, and said that Ukraine's fraud was a 'discriminate image' created by the left and their 'wealth property'.
'The Democrats in this group interacted with those who thought that Ukraine was from the country to get rid of Trump's films,' News said.
People can only justify why they are determined to abolish the president in a year more than a year.
After News finished his speech, Hafpost's senior political journalist Geneffer Pentry decided to find out whether Democratic politicians want to know the matter deeply.
So far, Connective Representative Jim Hams (D) has only responded, but we are suspected that many of his colleagues will believe his words as true.
News suspects the mediate.com that the comments on the dressing of the dresses are reflected in the deliberate steel records of the 'conscious and undefined extra details'.
It is a collection of allegations against former British Ulvali Christopher Steel's exploding against the Trump, in which he claims that it is possible to be a 'smooth node' that sex workers appear to be involved in 'discriminating' in a hotel room in Moscow.
It has been stunned by the change in the detail given to the Chief Minister of Honey Medical College Rajendran CPCIT police from the vote of student Udit Surya, who has been arrested for fraudulent cases in the NEET examination.
Dr. Venkatesan is from Chennai's Tandiyar.
He is a doctor at Chennai Stanley Hospital.
His son, Udhid Surya, was complaining that she had been falsified in the Neet election.
In the subsequent investigation, students Udhid Surya and his father Dr. Venkateshan were arrested by the CPCIT police.
In the investigation, it has been found in the investigation that Udhi's father, Venkateson, paid Rs.20 lakhs and took another student to write an exam and fugitively fugitive the son in the medical college.
Udhid Surya and his father were arrested in court and jailed.
In this case, the Chief Minister of Honey Government Medical College, Rajendran, had been asked by the CPCIT police (for the inspection of Udai Surya) in connection with the NEET examination.
There is a difference between his explanation and the ballot given by Udit Suryah to the CPCIT police.
In an explanation given by Chief Minister of Honey Medical College Rajendran, a person from Holticket was present at the gathering.
It is said that it was on the basis that students were enrolled.
It was stated by the Chief Minister of the College that Udhid Surya was a part of the NEET examination persons, who participated in the inclusion and students and joined the classroom.
But Udith Suryah has said that he himself was directly involved in the inclusion and admission of students.
How's Udhith in Surya College with a holticket with the photograph of a man who made a snake
Why did you miss attention during inclusion and student admission
The questions are raised.
It has now been found in the investigation that the student Udhid Surya has given his photography list of self-sufficient selects in the medical college.
Photography and photographs in the hall ticket are different.
Besides, the vote given by student Udhid Suryah and the vote given by the Chief Minister of Honey Government, Rajendran, to the CPCIT officials is different.
Hence, the CPCIT police have also started investigations with top officials.
If the results are to come out, the serpents will be there.
I know who's related to it.
Sarathbawar said that the Department of Implementation was ready tomorrow in the case of cooperative banking illicit, and said that I will not be able to subsidize the central government.
In the last 2007 of Maharashtra Cooperative Bank, the government has lost Rs.25,000 crore for treasury.
This loss has been reported due to reasons such as lending to sugar plants and hundreds of plants in violation of the rules.
Last month, the Mumbai Police had filed a lawsuit against senior Congress leader, former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and 70 in the name of the Mumbai ICC order on these abuses.
This includes political leaders, former cooperative bank executives and officials.
In this case, the Implementation Department has prosecuted Ajitbawar and Nationalist Congress leader Sarathbawar on the basis of the case registered by the police.
Sarathbawar was former Chief Minister of Marathi and Union Minister of Congress-led government.
The action of the Department of Implementation has been intensified in the elections held next month (October 21) after the Maratia Legislative Assembly.
At this point, the Nationalist Congress leader Sarath Bhawar interacted with reporters in Mumbai.
I am not a member or a member of the Cooperative Bank or a decision-making place but I am grateful to the Implementation Department in this case.
I don't have to be surprised in this action.
I am often out of Mumbai for the campaign for assembly elections.
Therefore, the implementation department should not misunderstand me.
I'm going to the Implementation Office on Friday.
And I will give them the information they want.
Their right is to investigate the case.
I am the one who believes in the Constitution.
So I will give full support to the investigation.
Marathi is following the principle of Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
We don't know how to move ahead of the Delhi order.
Marati's Chief Minister Devendra Patnavis has denied accusations of political intervention in this matter.
He said about this:
The ICORT had ordered the police to prosecute the case and the implementation department will investigate the case when it is fraudulent to Rs. 100 crore.
In this regard, the Implementation Department has taken up the case.
It is wrong to say that this action has been taken for political reasons.
Renewable bio-economic research can help in reducing smoke output
In recent years, electric cars and desla semi-tracks have been shifting into headlines, it appears like a flying flight without renewable energy limits: Airlines
However, a professor of Alberta University has created a technology to use renewable biofuels as aerial fuel.
Dr. David Brusseller, an Agricultural, Biological and Environmental Sciences University, started the program in 2003.
His laboratory has created hydrocarbon fuel from lipid wastes such as cuisine oil, animal flour and canola oil.
Without ethanol and other biofuels, the technology will enable the use of low oil in its production to reduce carbon releases of about 85 percent of petrol based fuels and allow the use of waste from other factories during this process.
This technology is working to reflect hydrocarbons in petroleum based fuels.
Our technologies in the first generation will create the same hydrocarbons in Diesel Cassolin.
This gives a new light to the use of biofuels, the biofuel technologies already developed, losing stability in low temperatures, which creates a serious problem for a higher flying plane.
"The problem in air fuel is like GATH-22 problem," Brussels said.
In fact, its value is less than diesel, but it needs more.
The Brussels Laboratory is now focusing on two selects to produce biofuels for aircraft.
In the first phase, their hydrocarbon biofuel is another refinery and is a less dangerous approach to insert hydrogen.
The second select will stabilize fuel even in low temperatures and continue the work of a partially-made pedagogy.
On the second choice, Brusselser said that we can play a few sports games with the sportspersons in our reactor.
There's more danger in it.
Both Aircrafts and Canada and the US military are making excessive investments for renewable choice, the sub-productor of Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to manufacture it commercially.
He said that in the future, someone is expected to impose carbon tax on them.
They expect a change in that situation.
Forge is currently operating a testing plant near Edman's Waste Management Centre and has recently received US 4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to help build a 25 million manufacturing plant in Sompra in Ondario.
The plant is expected to produce 19 million litres of biofuel every year.

He said that in the political language, the anger should be reduced, but I will not stop using the word 'revenge'.
Despite his demand for peace, a cabinet minister told the Times: 'We have not seen the Gleats Johns [Manchal Cross] struggle in this country or the Los Angeles Revolt [in 1992].
People did not think that it was possible in this country because it did not happen before.
Now they have a model of yellow stone struggle and modern telephones to integrate it and only two prominent leaders need to encourage the people.
Following the release of four white police officers in the case of black auto driver Rotney King, the riot in Los Angeles was closed in 1992.
In the beginning of this year, devastation and destruction were carried out in the streets of Paris over six weeks by the French revolutionaries against the state worn by the well-known yellow cheeks - Gleat Johns.
The Minister noted that Mr. Janson had warned under the leadership that if Britain fails to move away from the EU, the confidence of our political system would lead to a greater loss.
If 66 percent of us say that 30 million people might have joined the vote, then 10 million people are still unsatisfactory, he added.
Though 99 percent of them are neglected, more than 10,000 are really angry, they write to their parliamentarians and prevent them.
There is no need for it, and thousands of people will soon be on the streets.
A senior cabinet minister added that with the change of the second poll, the decision of the first poll is likely to be the danger of a rapid and mass insurgency in the country.
Mr. Janson has called upon voters to conduct a general election to resolve the problem of Brexit.

Increasing the amount of pests can increase the risk of heart disease and paralysis.
A new study shows that working with large quantity of germs may be the cause of heart disease in the early days.
The situation was in the group of Japanese Americans in Hawai, which had been followed for more than three decades.
Researchers found that in comparison to those who did not work with germs, the maximum number of individuals were more than 45 percent of the risk of heart disease or paralysis.
The Survey emphasizes the importance of utilizing individual security equipment at the time of industrial insects, documentation in medical records including insects due to work and control of routine heart disease risk factors.'
He is an elderly medical officer at Hawai University in Manova.
These innovations have emerged from the data received from over 6,000 persons in Ohu, who participated in the Guakini Honellu heart programme.

Police shut down illegal Marrijuvana voting in San Caprial Valley: CPS Los Angeles
L Mande (CPSLA) - A illegal Marrijuvana neeming police closed on Thursday in San Caprial Valley
In the afternoon, the police raided the weekend on the basis of the sale of unlawful neem bane, at around 4.37 p.m. in the afternoon, in an office building in Delstar Avenue's 9600 Black, and discovered peotane honey oil and affluent caju oil in large herbs.
LD Christopher Keno in El Mande police said that officials were discovered as a machine used to use the web cartridges.
Keno said this is a very dangerous process.
Keno, who worked in the drug sector, said that there is a possibility of fire in the process of sewing oil for use of neem products.
He said that as it is enriched, the normal power in our clothes will only cause firecrackers and cause an explosion.
If there are many species and such things, then the layer can be completely destroyed by the blast, without a common fire crash.
A Hasmat group was called to the empty office to seize the illegal and dangerous material.
The value of the captured goods and equipment was not immediately known.
As soon as they received an extraordinary information, experts told them that they had discovered illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is in the backdrop of illegal neeming.
They believed that because the place was empty, the person could have set up an office there.
As the investigation continues, they wanted to ensure that the illegal neeming goods are not available to all, particularly the recent information regarding neeming.
'It's really what they want, even if they don't know,' he said.
It can be mixed with other evil products.
This is very bad for our society and children, so we always warn to avoid such activities.
First Elizabeth's dress will be displayed at Hampton Court Palace
It was done by the best samplet, weighed with silver pottery, embraced in a well-known bank full of plants, animals and peacocks.
Ellery Linn, who is responsible for clothing in historical royal palaces, says only one.
Hundred years ago, he was hung on the wall of a small rural Paris Church, which he saw, could be a dress of the first Elizabeth clothing from Almari.
In Hierfordsheer, the luxury dress used in the Church of Backton, the dress of Elizabeth will be screened next month in the Hampton court premises, near the same rooms that Dudeur Rani would wear it 450 years ago, three years later.
The clothing of the 16th century all over the royal sequence will only be the significance of this innovation.
The three-year research strengthens the opinion of experts that the cloth was forced to be part of the royal family cloth, even though there was no sword testimony to say that the cloth was once worn by Elizabeth Rani.
The most magnificent clothing of silver is legally allotted to the most important members of the royal family, and the higher quality of empireed plants and flowers, excessive deer and dogs, peacocks, fishermen and one bear shows the higher status of the former owner.
At the time of its formation, the Country may have the same value as the Tuter Mansion.
Moreover, in the 1950s, in the latter part of the Elizabeth regime, other women in the Rajya Sabha would not have accepted that their opponents would have wore such a fine clothing.
That's a big thing, so many colleagues came and looked at it.
When they were surprised to see it, it was always satisfactory to see when they saw it going out with the satisfaction that they were one of the clothes of the royal family.
The second long age in the slaughter gathering, which was again cut to be the alphabet cloth of the dark St. Faith Church in Backton, cannot be considered unexpected.
Bagton has served him throughout the long life of Elizabeth Rani, the most nearest village of Blanch Beri, among the respected women, and the local stories have long linked the textile sector with Bari.
Though the cloth was in the post-death period in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth might have given it to the Berry family or the Paris Church in the memory of Blanch before he died in 1603.
After more than 1000 hours of safety, more than 400 hours of the alphabet cloth, which was spent in a very technological handling with specific silk and magnificent surgery injections, will be displayed in the era of Elizabeth, the most famous 'Rainpo Fordread' in the era of Elizabeth, showing that he wears a sort of count in which the hotfield house was credited during the exhibition.
Liby Thamson, who is headed by security, says, 'When you work with traditional dresses, you really respect the producers,' a large part of its security took place in the cattle dressed in the Hampton court fields - the greater place to place something in the precious curtains of Arctica.
I had a great respect for those who have produced it while looking at the predecessor and backbone empire.
I have never worked in such a wealthy dragon.
Elizabeth's disappearance clothing is being displayed at the Hampton Court Hall on October 12.

According to Mexico government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexico drugs captured in Chicago are very special and cannot handle them without security cover.
In the laboratory, hijackers are printed in cocaine boxes.
More than one-third of them can be seen as L Mencho's posture.
'He's the reason for sending out the thing that really kills innocent women and children,' Donahk said.
So, Donahk said that if a child dies, then the medicines are more likely to come out of the organization of L. Mencho.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died due to drug addiction.
Those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi the Father of India should not say that they are Indians.
Everyone knows that the BJP leaders continue to misrepresent Gandhi and Nero.
A few hours before the incident of Howdy Modi in Houston, USA, Union Minister Amitshah has said that Pakistan's occupation of Kashmir was the reason for the formation of Kashmir.
A few days ago, many Bajagwans, including Pragya Tagore, have been praising Gandhi and praising Kotse.
At the 'Howdi Modi' event in Houston, Prime Minister Modi reiterated his support for US President Trump.
Instead, US President Trump has lauded Modi very much.
In his address, he said that there was a lot of division in Hindi and as the father of this country, he removed these divisions and united them.
Normally, when Gandhiji was the father of India, he was shocked by many.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, "Howdi Modi, who was present in Prime Minister Modi, is using him to campaign for the trump.
This is a very wrong thing.
It is also wrong to replace Gandhiji with him as his father of India.'
Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh said, "American President Trump has praised our Prime Minister as the father of India.
Some have protested for this.
Thus, those who are not proud of calling Prime Minister Modi the father of India should not be called Indians.'
The relevance of the punding principles is due to global multilateral mechanisms being lazy.
Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary Orisinghe pointed out at a meeting of the Parisera Mission Ministers in New York, the relevance of the punding principles as the global multilateral mechanisms were disturbed.
Speech by Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Secretary Arya Singh:
External Affairs Secretary Orisinghe underscores the relevance of the punding principles as the global multilateral mechanisms are being disturbed
Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the Parisera Movement held in New York on September 26, 2019 as part of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, External Affairs Secretary Ravinath Orisinghe underscored the relevance of the Bunding principles while the global multilateral mechanisms are in trouble.
Including 55 percent of the world's population, it is its religious obligation to give voice to the grassroots of the southern world, particularly the growing smaller countries.
Sri Lanka reaffirmed its commitment to the efforts of the Parisa campaign to counter the current global challenges to overcome national borders such as conflicts, migration, climate change and infectious diseases.
The unconventional security threats such as climate change are not only economic and social challenges, but also the devastation caused by humanity, the social and nations are a threat of security.
While welcoming the summit for the terminal actions of the United Nations General Secretary at the United Nations Headquarters on September 23, 2019, Secretary Aryasinghe expressed deep concern over the negative impacts of climate change in islands such as Sri Lanka.
Foreign Affairs Secretary expressed confidence that the COP25 in Chile would increase efforts to counter climate change by fulfilling the duties mentioned in the Paris Agreement.
Foreign Secretary Orisinghe said that Sri Lanka has the significance of countering all forms of racism, hatred and violent extremism and the need to focus on new threats that the Easter demonstrates on Sunday's attacks in Sri Lanka.
Such a global threat threat threatens the security of all countries and not to deal with it alone, but rather necessary joint efforts and called upon the Parisera Movement to contribute in a positive and consolidated manner to this global security threat.
The Foreign Affairs Secretary said that Sri Lanka believes in an independent society determined by the freedom of opinion, but should be aware of the hate speech, the threat of misusing the Internet and social media bases.
'Stablishing the principles of sovereignty and political independence as a means of preserving international peace and security and enhancing friendship and cooperation among the nations,' was the essence of the ministerial meeting and a result document was accepted during the meeting.
Sri Lanka is a co-ordinator of the 1955 Pundung Convention and a founder member of the Parissera movement.
For the past six decades, the committee has been progressing and its members are now beyond 120 in the United Nations, i.e. two-thirds of the membership.
The Sri Lankan permanent embassy for the United Nations is New York.
In order to improve the livelihood of the poor in Tamil Nadu, former Chief Minister Jailita announced the 'Amma Cement' scheme at the lowest rate.
The cement is being sold at a cost of Rs. 190.
In order to get this, Aadhar Card, Family Card, Housing and Accounted Building Map or Approval Certificate of Grameen Governance Officer should be provided to the seller of Mother Cement in Tamil Nadu smoke commodities.
The number of cements we buy, the 'DD' should be linked to the application.
After registering the 'DD' oil on the Internet, cement bonds will be provided within a week.
This is the process.
It is not followed regularly in many places.
There is a complete complaint in Tamilnadu to get the money and sell the mother's cement bandages in the barren market.
Beneficiaries are also giving moulds to avoid waves and buy cement bundles too soon.
The PS4 sports goes to ancient style, the surprising place has been published in the 4 news of Soni.

The Sri Lankan government has welcomed the proposal to reaffirm the evening island's public interest.
The media statement released by the Foreign Minister in this regard is as follows:
External Affairs Secretary Aryasinghe welcomed the proposal for re-approval of the evening island in public interest.
External Affairs Secretary Ravinath Arisinghe welcomed the proposal for the re-approval of the evening island in the public welfare family last Thursday and reiterated Sri Lanka's full support for the rapid pace used in the process of re-approval of Gambia to allow the public welfare leaders to participate in the conference in Rwanda in the evening 2020.
One of the parallel events of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly, he condoled the condolences at a meeting of Public Welfare Foreign Affairs Ministers held in New York on September 26, 2019 under the chairmanship of Minister of State for Public Welfare and United Nations, Wimbledon Prabhu Ahmed.
'Sri Lanka has experienced strong bilateral relations with the neighbouring neighbourhood and the evening of this co-south Asian neighbouring country,' Arising said, 'It is a pleasure to indicate its goal of reintegrating the public goods, one of the major efforts made by the new administration in the evening last year.'
The Foreign Secretary pointed out that a comprehensive evaluation work taken by the Public Welfare Secretariat in the evening in January 2019 has led to a neutral resolution and that any restrictions against its re-entry should sometimes be regarded as mere grievances that affect all countries.
He stressed that more restrictions that lead to less incentives should not be placed on their path.
Secretary of External Affairs was also present at the 77 Foreign Ministers Meeting held in New York on Friday, September 27, 2019.
G7 has been specifically designated to invite global measures to address various needs of countries in special circumstances such as weaker countries, land-surrounding developing countries and developing small islands.
These problems are badly affected by economic and social development and affect their ability to achieve sustainable development goals.
The organisation must act as a joint voice to seek greater international assistance and support for the affected and marginalised countries, particularly for financial and skill development.
In a statement published during the Asian Cooperation Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers Meeting of Sri Lanka, as the joint Prime Minister of the pillar on 'Scientific, Technology and Innovation', Foreign Affairs Secretary Orisinghe noted that the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Region plays an important role in sustainable socio-economic development in the field of textiles.
The central level of Asian Cooperation Dialogue to enhance economic competitiveness in the region is helping Asian countries to compete at the equivalent level in the global market.

Ronald Lee Haskell: The person killed his former wife's family in Texas was punished
Ronald Lee Haskel was punished for killing up to four of Stephen and Kethi Stay and their five children during the spring period of 39 and 2014.
On 9th July, 2019, he enters Stein's house to find out his separate wife Melanie Haskel's location.
He was not there but his sister Kethin Stay and his family were there.
Harris County Sheriff's office officials reported that Stephen Stay, 39, Kethi Stay, 33, 13 and 4-year-old two boys and 9 and 7-year-old girls were killed during the shooting of the hostel.
Only one of the families lived when only 15-year-old Caste Street.
After some time he was completely cured, officials said he was injured at that time.
On Thursday, the media rejected Ronald Lee Haskel's slaughter.
The court was postponed till Monday for punishment.
Kwandam portal closes the truth: Science Paper
The end of a US military research has brought the Guantam portal closer.
Such a network will provide an unprecedented security, exploration and time-bound capabilities to the Army in the common network approach.
The Centre for Information Distributed at the Military Research Laboratory of the US Army's Resistance Skill Development (MRD), which was funded and managed by the Military Research Office of the Laboratory, showcased the achievement of the Inspective University researchers using fibre optic cables - 50 km away - to exchange quantity backs.
Behind is a contradiction between quantum products like cubics.
The interaction between the two ubits, one, the other, the consequences of the accumulation will affect and the second ubit is in the most trouble.
'This [50 kms] is far away from the level of two orders and the process of setting up of a quantum network between the cities,' said the researcher in the Institute and the principal analyst of the programme, whose innovations have been published in the Nature Journal Kwandom Infirmation.
Inter-city quantum networks will be built by the remote corners of the physician cubics, even if they are kept far away, it will be uncomfortable.
Researchers said that supply is essential behind this to set up a quantum network.
Sara Campbell, Joint Manager, Military Programme, who supported the research, said that this is one of the key steps to facilitate a massive distributed recession.
On the other hand, after traveling through fibre, the level of the back is higher to meet the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum network uses.
Research teams started testing with calcium atoms stuck in one of the iron engines.
While using laser lights, researchers created a quantum position on Iron, they inspired to express a quantum of data collected.
As a result, the quantum conditions of the nuclear and light pieces were followed.
It is a challenge to send photographs through fiber optical cables.
"Fotan's wave of 854 namemeters swallowed by Calcium is soon swallowed by the optical fiber," he said.
Therefore, his team first sent light pieces on the path of an unprecedented learning lighted by a strong laser.
The wavebank of Bhutan has been transformed into a long distance journey - the current standard chain for telecommunications - 1550 nano metres.
After that researchers sent this potato through a 50-km fiber optic cable.
Even after wave change and far-flung travel, their patterns showed that nuclear and light pieces were still at the background.
These decisions provide a straight path to enable the use of calcium to sustain calcium in collaboration with high-level cubits.
Military researcher Dr. Fredrick Fademi, who is the Vice-General of the Programme, said that a large-scale background network is essential for accurate conditions, guidance and time-to-time use.
