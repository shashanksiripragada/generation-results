There are revolutionary movements before and behind Bhagat Singh.
However, it is not merely admirable that Bhagat Singh and his companions have given a new dimension and a clear principle to revolutionary movements and to Indian politics.
We can still see a concept among the people that the revolutionaries are simply foolish and unconscious about human lives.
The time of Bhagad Singh is a reflection of his humanity, a clear thought and abilities.
Bhagad Singh was named in India after a legislative bombing ceremony on April 1929.
In Tamil Nadu, he was introduced to the public in 1930.
But within a year of introduction, his fame has spread very fast in all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in history, the name of any leader born in Uttar Pradesh, including Gandhiyaar, did not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short span of time.
The reason for this is Father Periyar ji.
On the second week of the death of Bhagat Singh, an editorial appeared in the Republican weekend.
The editorial lauded the values of Bhagat Singh and presented some views on the political situation that day.
Some parts from the headquarter:-
'If he had recently decided that Bhagat Singh ji had determined his entire principles to be correct and he had decided to be the right path, we would certainly say that he would have happened as he had walked and he would not have said that if he had not done so, he would not have said that he would have been a good man.
So now we will call him a real man.
It is our strong impression that India really needs Bhagat Singh's policy.
If Mr. Bhagad Singh did not steal his life, this success would not have been a source of such popularity.
And we will say that if Bhagad Singh had not been lifted, then Gandhiji would have been created again.
Why did the people of India leave their lives to be useful in showing the true equality and peace of the world to the people of the world for the cause of sickness or sickness.
In general, we appreciate Bhagad Singh's mind, marriage and handloom by saying that nobody else is unable to reach.'
Father Periyar ji said in the Republican newspaper.
In this case, the policeman, Dennis Turner, who was a police officer at the school in the incident, arrested the girl who was caught in the school for the abduction of the teacher.

His handloom copies have also been taken.
Later, he was informed to the family members of the girl and handed over to her family.
I don't know if he took another child to the police station.
In an interview with the media about this, Girgland, his daughter, who agreed to release the identification of the girl Gaya Roll, said that my daughter suffering from the problem of sleeping 'Sleep Apnea' is suppressed in time due to the consequences of medicines used for it.
I was very surprised to say that he was arrested for this, and it is difficult for any 6-year-old child to understand and explain it.
