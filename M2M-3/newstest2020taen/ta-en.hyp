There are revolutionary movements before and after Bhagat Singh.
However, Bhagat Singh and his friends have given a new dimension to revolutionary movements and Indian politics through it, and a clear principle.
We can still see that there is an opinion among the people that the revolutionaries are just clerics and unconscious stones about human lives.
During the period of Bhagat Singh, we feel their humanitarianity, obvious thought and ability.
After the assembly bombing programme on April 1929, the name of Bhagat Singh spread in India.
In Tamil Nadu, he was introduced to the public in 1930.
But in a year after his introduction, his fame has spread very fast in all corners of Tamil Nadu.
This is the most surprising news in history, the name of any leader born in Uttar Pradesh, including Gandhiji, has not spread in Tamil Nadu in such a short time.
That's why the father is Periyar.
On the following week of the assassination of Bhagat Singh, an editorial was published in the Republican Week.
The editorial commended the characteristics of Bhagat Singh and presented some comments on the political situation.
Some parts from the headquarter:
'If he decides that Bhagad Singh ji had really decided that he was the right way to fulfill his policies, we would have said that he would have been walking and if he had not been able to say that he would not have been a sure man.
So now we call him a real man.
It is our strong absorption that Bhagad Singh's policy is really necessary for India.
If Shri Bhagad Singh did not take away his life, then this victory would not have been the source of such popularity.
We will say that if Bhagat Singh had not been able to lift up, Gandhiji would have been able to do so.
Bhagsingh, who had to be sick of the sickness of the sickness, had left his life for the people of India to show the path of real equality and peace to the people of the world.
We appreciate Bhagat Singh's mind, compassion and handloom.'
Father Periyar ji has said in the Republican journal.

Does Bhajak take over caste politics in Tamil Nadu
In Tamilnadu, however, it is said that in the end, it is said to have taken caste politics into the hands of the Bajak.
When Modi was the Prime Minister for the first time, he was in a position to leave Tamarai in Tamil Nadu.
After this, for the second time, i.e., during the election of Empire, 'You don't know what to do and in Tamilnadu, we should swell up in Tamilnadu.'
However, the soil was poured out in five contesting seats.
Though the whole country is swinging, there is a wave of opposition in Tamil Nadu.
Moreover, Triple Talaq, Kashmir affairs, Hindi imposing, One Nation, One Language.
Everything like this is mixed up, and it is still in jealousy.

On the one hand, the BJP plans to root the Bhajaka in Tamil Nadu within the upcoming assembly elections.
For this, the BJP's leadership has come to an end through a direct field report and intelligence report.
Accordingly, whether it is a superstition or an individual, there is a sense of immense importance among the people of the NADA, the Vannier community and the people of the Vannier community, whether it is a superstition or an individual.
It is said that it is sorry for the political parties.
This heat has begun to be implemented in the hands of the Bhajak tactically.
We have decided to honour and honour those communities in respect of pride or importance.
So, the appointment of Saudrarajan as the Governor of Telangana was one of the same.
Likewise, it is said that the BJP government is also prioritizing Nadars in high positions in ISRO.
It is true that if the Bhajak works in the form of pride of every caste, then it will be a matter of pride and happiness for the people of that caste.
Moreover, in any case, it will enjoy the Bhajak in this caste politics.
At the same time, when Tamilnadu has already been left behind in caste politics, it is not known whether the actions of Bajaga would be like pouring more oil on the burning fire.
It is true that if the tribe starts to burn and burn, the whole of the tamarind flourishes in Tamilnadu will swallow on the same fire.
