When will you open the doors of the house temple for a woman in the period
My innovative Sakhi had told me about two weeks ago that he was preparing for the third drive.
Third is a festival celebrated mainly in North India, which is celebrated with the prayers of happiness and marriage.
Thirdly, the virtuous women fast throughout the day and worship every night.
I was very enthusiastic and happy in the voice of my happiness while talking to me.
Sakhi had taken a new sari to wear on the third day and put henna in both hands.
I also agreed to see it happy, but on the third morning its periods started.
After that, both his mother and mother-in-law had refused to worship and worship him.
The other women of the house also advised me to stay away from the prayer room and also asked me not to disappear the luggage of worship.
It was also said to me to stay away from other women who were slaughtering the third.
Entry of Periods and Home Temples
After that incident, when Sakhi talked to me about crying again, I felt like somebody had pimples in my hand.
I had the idea of the zeal of my happiness and its preparation for the third.
Once again looked at the photographs of the hand kept in the henna found on the Whatsup and my eyes suddenly got wet .
I said in anger that Tare had to leave such a religion along with the third, which decided to enter the temple due to the love and supreme love of the star heart.
Removing the restrictions on the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple, the report of the Supreme Court's order was flashing together on a number of TV screens on Friday morning and I was reminded of my coincidence and third case in Bhopal.
What was the dispute of the Sabarimala temple
The entry of women from 10 to 50 years of age in Sabarimala temple in Kerala was still prohibited.
The ban was implemented for hundreds of years in this temple, one of the main pilgrimages of the Hindus.
Behind this distinction, the interpretation of the temple's administrative system was such that Lord Ayappa sitting inside the temple has been a life-long Brahmin.
Therefore, women who are at the age of menstruation cannot go there and worship there.
The Indian Young Lawyers Association challenged the ban on the temple by filing an application for public interest in the Supreme Court in 2006.
The Constitutional Constituencies of five members of the Supreme Court had heard their payments on 28th September, 2018 after hearing 12 years of hearing and hearing of both parties for hours.
What did the Supreme Court say
Buddha Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice R.
Nariman, Justice A.M.
Khanvilkar and Justice Chandrachud's Constitutional Constituencies pay the ban on entry of women in the temple was described as a violation of Section 14 of the Constitution.
Khandpeeth said that no one should also be allowed to worship in the temple without discrimination.
The Fifth and the only lady Justice Indu Malhotra of the Constitutional Constituencies showed disagreement with the decision of the remaining four and the Court paid above 4-1.
Internal dust of blind faith
My brother's face was seen in my mind while reading about the payments of the court.
My adolescent sister had started the period two years ago.
He told me one day in a terrible voice that when he was in the period, the grandmother had forbidden to go to the room of Lord Ji.
Besides, it is also forbidden to go to the kitchen and touch the kitchen.
Bhatri ji told me that that day Mummy made me an emotional pair.
I was very hungry so I don't remember that my periods are going on.
Therefore, I went to the running kitchen to get rid of the junk.
Grandmother came from the bottom and he was very angry at Mommy and asked me why this was the case
I had no answer to the question.
My far-flung sister ji is asking us to respond to hundreds of households in India.
The question is, the Supreme Court has taken up the restriction on the entry of women in Sabarimala, but when will we remove the logical dust of blind faith on our heart
When will we open our home temples, our kitchens and the doors of our heart for women passing through the period
Periods or menstruation is a common biological process related to reproduction in the body of women.
How can the procedure which is the creation and the existence of human being be untouched
If a woman is indecent for five days of the month then we should finish such criteria of sanctity.
The Supreme Court can stand in front of us by pushing a bond against the whole world, but the question is, when will we stand in front of the other half of our population as a society
The tribal Sardar of Kerala, who does not leave the jungle despite floods

Nevertheless, the Sardar jungle of the community is not ready to leave because it is afraid of anger.
What's this fear, look at this video report.

Rehabilitation with Alster Lambretta Club
Lambretas was an essential helper in the late 1960s.
The spirit of the era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiastics from Italy's motor scooter.
About 100 scooters from all UK and Ireland travelled to Co-Fermanagh 70 years after the first Alster Lambretta Club was constructed at the end of this week.
One of the two members of the original club, Chris Wills bought his first lambretta in 1966.
Scooter was not only a form of transportation for me but also an alternative to use it for other things.
It was like a little sports.
I have never come in a long sight and now I am very old for it, he added.
Originally, it was affordable, reliable amount and it was available at a reasonable price and once you have it, you can do other things than traveling from A to B.
He used to race Lambreta in the Time Tryle near T. Circuit on the oil of man.
The first Alster Lambretta Club was integrated at the beginning of the decade of 10, but it was improved 12 years ago.
He started dying around 11, in the scooter, in the form of other transportation, the interest and distress did not usually help the club, so I thought, 'Na, just, end,' Chris said.
Thereafter, the interest of the people was seen in it a short while ago and it appears to be more or more developed.
The Philippe Steel is a Member Secretary of the Alster Lambretta Club, which is currently members.
Everyone has shown their own shares.
Looking at it, there will be people affected by the complete delays and a lot of reality started from there.
Others are in the scenes of racing, investors, there is a mixture of every kind of people here.
Some people are only about Vintage.
Many scooters were customized and none of them was equal to two scooters.
Where you can keep it originally or walk around 35 or 40 M . . . which was originally made to go to the smaller particles of Italy but some people have tune it .
Some of the forced tune bikes here may also go beyond 100 MPH .
At the end of the week, there were some discounts and money to be started.
And when the climate in Northern Ireland is not always pleasant like the Italian house in Lambretta, the sun was shining because the scooter county was traveling around the farming.
Ruth Davidson Tori Bracket Orders for Mon
Ruth Davids has been ordered to be a silent period between his consolidated colleagues so that the elderly Prime Minister can get a breakage deal above the limits.
Scottish Tori Leader said that the European Union's Lok Sabha vote had got enough time for discussion in the next two years.
The text of the text is a colourful and completely informative description of the Checkers Scheme of Boris Johnson.
He told BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that it is time to go back to the elderly Prime Minister.
Since the Tori workers gathered in Burmingham for their party conference, he said, the time has come for the last two years.
The former Foreign Secretary was one of the great officers of the State when most of the schemes were being planned - and appreciated it at the beginning of November last year.
Now it is time for the conservatives to go back to the Prime Minister, give them opportunity to complete the charges and support the service of the country.
In the context of silence, I would like to welcome him with a grand welcome.
Former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, after another broader interaction in the Bracket Dialogue, comments were received.
Therasa MA told the BBC Andrew Mar Programme that the Checkers Scheme has the potential to provide a real-free trade deal with the European Union, and thus stressed that it believes in Bracket.
Smt Davids was also told that the second Scottish would fight in the forthcoming elections with the commitment of the Declaration to obstruct the Freedom Lok Sabha as it promised to the people of Scottish in 2014 that it would be once in the event of one generation.
Asked about the orders for another Lok Sabha on any Bracket Soda, he said: In respect of our history in Scotland, I have repeatedly spoken about the fact that if you are a nationalist, you cannot run the Lok Sabha again because you have not achieved the desired results.
I would have been very stunned if I had said that you could re-drive this Bracket Lok Sabha because the result of which I broke was not possible.
After the police incident, M8 completely opened
The M8 Motorway in Glassgo has been completely reopened after being closed by a police incident.
The police said that between the concern for the well-being of the wait, the road was closed on 15 downheads in both directions.
As a result of this dam, the road was completely stable for three hours and there was a traffic block in the city in which the Great Scottish Run was organized.
Subsequently, the 20-year-old man was taken to the Glassgo Royal Informery for testing.
Christen Blassy Ford ' s friend Bret Kevenou explains the statement of the attack .
The High School Friend of Dr. Christen Blassy Ford, Land Keezer, who had two adolescents, had put an insistence on the Nomini Breat Cavenou of the Supreme Court, wrote a letter clarity to the Senate Judicial Committee, although he does not remember the House Party where the said illicit conduct was carried out, but he considers the Ford responsible.
Keezer had earlier announced a statement by his Eterny in which he said that he does not remember the question party, and he never remembers the meeting with Kevenou.
On Thursday, in his jubani before the Judiciary Committee, Kevanou used to introduce the statement of the Caesar as an authentication of his innocence, but he was forced to say that Keezer had said that he had faith in the Ford.
Republican Sen Jeff Flake and other middle-class Senators had sought a long delay in a week on the full Senate vote on Kevanou's confirmation to give time for the investigation, followed by President Trompe FBI to conduct an inquiry within a week on Friday.
On Saturday, Keejer told the committee through his lawyer that he was ready to fully collaborate with the supplementary investigation of the FBI of Kevanou.
However, as my client has already made it clear, he does not know Kevenou and he never remembers being in the party or he cannot remember whether he was present with Dr. Ford or where he was present.
It was also said that Keyser does not give the responsibility of Dr. Ford and he has already told the press that he believes to be the responsibility of Dr. Ford.
However, the simple and unchanged fact is that it is unable to support this thing because there is no memories about the incident of making it.
A friend of Kevanou, Mark Jaz, who was present during the attack, also said that he would collaborate in the FBI investigation.
The inhabitants of Chicago, who have been wrongly defected, remember the life under the corrupt police and their gang.
Elinois's top lawyer Chicago is trying to change the foundation of the despairable period of the history of the police.
It is believed that a bad police attacked innocent residents of a housing project, which made dozens of people hunting on artificial artisans.
So far, 42 wrongdoing people have been defrauded.
Eda B. Wells Housing Project, where a group of Chicago's corrupt police attacked almost fearless residents in more than a decade, only one blanket has survived.
Sergeant Ronald Watts was his Sardar.
Residents have entered the wrong police reports, making evidence and attacks on them and their strategic group of guilt.
Willy Martin and Claone Glover have so far been blamed by the Cookie County State Attorney Kim Fox.
If you didn't support it then you were falling.
You were against it.
You were opposite to its operation and funding, Clone Glover told the voters.
He was scared.
I was trying to go away, he got out of his friend.
I didn't want to go anywhere, said Willi Marty.
The Fox's defect-free integrity unit is reviewing more than 30 to 40 cases related to advocates.
Landen Elle, a resident of Eda B. Wells Housing, told that many people talk about the vote.
He said that he has spoken.
But it doesn't make any difference.
As directed by other ex-residents, Clerisa Baker, he was his word before a sergeant with a bag.
Tenny has its own gang.
So who will trust us
Baker said.
Joshua Tafar of the University of Chicago's Doshamukti Project replies until recently.
He further added that because he had seen these people as a nickaljog and did not care about them because they are black people in the housing project, who were drunk to Kashak in their minds, Tephere said.
Sergeant Votes went to jail in 2013 and were in jail for 22 months to try to steal from the FBI detective.
Because of the votes, Martiz Vice also went to jail.
During that time I had only my son.
I was away from it for four years.
He was fortunate to know who I was because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him.
No one has been snatched four years without a crime.
Blockchain, Vertual Reality and AI, a two-year-old federality embarrasses the future
Before becoming a Corporate Basward of FIDALITI 2018, it identified the potential of Blockchain.
CEO AB Johns was one of the most dangerous and most vulnerable categories last year.
Just a few years ago, I and some other senior officials were keen to know what was going on here, especially for Betcoin, Johns.
We started simultaneously so that we can say that we have started understanding this.
This curiosity started excavating bitcoin at one place in New Hampshire, while the cost of crippto was around  180.
In December last year, when Betkoin had increased to about 20,000 dollars, Johns was told that the price has increased and suddenly we are earning money that was never drained.
He has not mentioned how many bitcoins he has been digging or how much he has earned.
Fidelity employees are obviously interested in the subject.
Blockchain clubs, seminars, office hours and meeting ups known as Bits and Blocks for its employees are organised in which there are about 2,600 members now.
The company has a configuration with a configuration that allows fidelity consumers to examine their cryptocurance balances on Fidelity Mobile Applications.
In 2015, he started simplifying charitable donations in Betcoin.
Johns was told that many other possible uses for Betcoin and Criptocarensy have been either rubbish or rubbished so far.
We are trying to hear the things of the market.
During this period, KT Chase is exploring the use of Strategy Heads and Blockchane Incubators (JFCAT) Heads, Public Blockchains and Enterprise Blockchains for Federation Centre for Applied Technology.
The chase could not be specifically commented on the projects, but said that it has seen a lot of interest from the consumers and participants and their employees.
It is still very new.
All these things that you are studying, if you test it deeper then it is still in the oldest stage of meditation.
We have tried to implement Blockchain in some examples where we had learnt a lot but technology is not sufficient to solve these problems.
At present, the group focuses on some obstacles, he added.
They are looking at how to make physical things token, for example, a piece of art or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space.
But we feel that they will come back, Chase said.
When the facility starts, it will be well decorated.
He used the example of the Pebble Clock which was unsuccessful by retail categories, but something that paid for fidelity.
Tenny's group created an application for smart watch, which was closed by collecting lakhs of funds through a Crowdfund Kickstar Abhiyan.
When the apple watch finally came to the market, the fidelity was ready.
He used to use an application developed for PABL to quickly live on the new app.
We don't make sure that the Pebble Watch is the next big thing but if we have people wearing this on our shoulders then we should also be there.
He taught us when smart watches came to the collective market and we were able to stay there.

Antonin Scalia Kevenou's anti-Made Libs will not be surprised, son says
The son of the late associate of the Supreme Court, Jez Antonin Scalia, told Fox News on Sunday that thanks to his so-called power of the Supreme Court in modern life, his father Jez Brett Kevanou's nomination would not have been hurt by the anti-corruption protest.
At the normal level, it will not be very surprised about the intensity of the nomination of the Supreme Court as it comes to the RVWAD - at least the way Christopher Scalia refers to the 13 Landmark case that women have the constitutional authority of abortion within a trimester.
In a jerk, Roy had stopped the States on their decision on how to effectively control abortion, and many states had taken steps to restrict abortion rights immediately in the context.
My father, with R. V. Wed, repeatedly used to say that in other matters, particularly in other cases, the Court was trying to really fall in and solve cultural issues which were seen to be addressed in the elections and the legal process, he added.
By trying to short-circuit the process, the Supreme Court caused greater damage and as a result, the fights for the deployment and nutrition of the Supreme Court became more hot because the Justice took the role that comes in the Legislative Assembly.
NEBRASCO Republican Sen Ben SESE had raised the same issue during the hearing of Kevanou's satisfaction at the beginning of this month when he reiterated that the Congress mostly represents the authority of non-responsive executive branch agencies and consequently leaves the Supreme Court to effectively determine the implementation uncertainties, which makes the supplementary legislations of the judges sacrificed by the Senators.
Hundreds of opponents were banned and arrested by the Captol Hill Police for inappropriate destruction of this action.
It was asked that Kevenou had got an opportunity to stay away from such negative reactions - which is now mainly focused on unsuccessful groups that were involved in genotypes decades ago - Scalia said that this disturbance is not likely to be avoided.
Replying to the claims that Kenonou responded to the claims made by the Senators on Thursday by asking about the critical conflicts against them, and sometimes, due to a radical attitude, the Justice has not always been peaceful.
Scalia, in the context of hot hot button cases, said that it is not so rare to be angry for justice.
It is true that Jaz Kevenou was perhaps more invaders, but it was because Sanjogo was very different.
He saved his good name from unsuccessful opponents.
Kevenou received the approval of the Judicial Committee of the Senate to move forward to the entire Senate Flower vote by the party-line 11-10 vote on Thursday.
In dramatic moments, Sen Jeff Flake, R-Arise said that it will only give its decisive swing vote in Kevano's side if the FBI is given a week's time to examine the claims of current and credible misconduct against Kevanou.
The investigation is underway and President Trump has said that the agency has a comprehensive authority for the interview of anyone he wants.
During the seventh phase of polling in Gujarat and other states, a case has been filed against Modi for showing a lotus mark.

After the case was filed, Narendra Modi replied that there is a depression of Congress in this matter.
Modi said that it is a matter of concern to them that one tea hair is challenging them.
Addressing the gathering in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, Prime Minister said that no complaint has been filed against him.
Modi said that I will never forget the day of April 30.
It is a matter of understanding that someone shows a puppet, pistol or gun.
However, he knows why the complaint against me was registered because I should show the flowers of jaundice to the people.
It is notable that FEIR was filed in the case of violation of the Adarsh Acharya Code against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the candidate of the post of BJP.
After his vote in Gujarat on Wednesday, Narendra Modi addressed the media by demonstrating the election symbol of the party.
The Congress had complained to the Election Commission against this issue.
After the investigation, the Commission considered the complaint to be correct.
However, while addressing a recent rally, Modi said that what is wrong in the marks I have shown.
In fact, it is such that the Congress was now scared of it.

Nurses pass unconfidence vote in the federation on pay-deal handling .
Members of the Royal College of Nursing have voted for discretion in the organisation to pass the speed of any discrepancy in the event of misrepresentation of the requisite wage addition.
The former General Secretary Genet Davis acknowledged that it came after a long-term story within the RCN, which had misrepresented the members to increase the immediate 3 incremental wages after the end of the 1 wage cap.
Many members were disappointed who did not get the required increase in the wages, which led to the pressure of Davis members, resulting in a general meeting of a crisis in Burmingham on Friday, in the Council of Colleges.
Burmingham's authentic and open discussion made the air clear and as a result, the college will emerge stronger, said RCN Chairman Maria Trivern.
This vote is clear and RCN's Council and Management have received a message.
In recent weeks, the Council has already stepped up the changes in the institution to listen to the members more closely and inclusively.
A meeting will be held in the next week and it is expected that members of the RCN Council will return.
Nursing Trust based on Nursing Trust, an NHS nurse told the guardian.
The action of the RCN Council has destroyed our faith and they have to go.
I hope that they will take respectable steps and follow the request.
I look forward to seeing whether members of other organisations are looking for equal solutions or not.
Rachel Herisson, GMB National Officer for NHS, told the Guardian in August: In the country, NHS employees have opened their salary halls and understand that the wages they thought have not been increased.
And they're angry.
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, RCN had admitted that it had made a lot of mistake in the process of 2018 Pay Soda and its communications.
However, it has been stated that the Scrap the Cape Campaign of RCN had obliged the government to end the salaries cap, which increased by 6.
The vote came after the independent report that the presentation of the RCN's deal was fortunate to its acceptance, when the request was imposed on Davis to stop the investigation of the Soda.
It is claimed that the RCN had submitted an accurate information, which means that members could not provide accurate orders on the property, when alternative options were not checked.
RCNA has published contradictory information whether there will be a 3 increase for all members or why.
In a separate briefing before the Congress of RCN, delegates were misrepresented that 3 increase will be increased and growth will increase.
In fact, there is an increase in the excess of 3 and in any case, only some of the top employees of their salaries bands will increase it soon.
The Electronic Reform Service spokesman said that the information given to the members about the implementation of the Soda after the Congress (as a result of the efforts to simplify the message).
The ERS believes that the failure to find out the decision makers in comparison to the existing decision, which was obviously compared to the proposed settlement, hinders the sure decision as it has failed to provide a clear reference to the benefits of 6.
4 per cent of RCN members passed the speed of discretion with 8 per cent of the vote.

The level of holistic disbursement in the society is increasing and the figures of the offices of the National Statistics show that the household loan record in the UK is high, while Britain spends more than 100 rupees annually.
But how should we worry about this panic of depression statistics
Is the life-long relationship with loans usually become a new ordinary thing - not just for small people but for the entire population
For instance, it is a motor car when we often buy the largest after home.
This week, Auto Trader had requested that all new cars will be purchased on finance in a decade as we look forward to paying for our motoring changes.
Director and Chartered Financial Planner of Equal Investors, Jeeney Boyle, of course, believes that there has been a relative change.
Credit cards are more prevalent now, and in the same way, balancing percentage of balancing, student loans and daily wage borrowers are also called Tenny.

If you want to buy a property worth four or five times your income, if you have a huge amount, it does not seem to be a big thing to add a little more god to it.
And people will be in trouble at this place.
For many years, the rate of interest has been very low and big mortgage or other payers should be taken into account that when the rate increases, they need to be taken care of.
Perhaps it can be understood that the commentators of the finance industry are reliable.
The Chief Executive Brian Broady of Loan Agency Free Finance says, "Dew is not a bad word.
In order to improve houses or buy new cars, taking loans is no longer seen as a small solution.
The rate of low interest has motivated many people to lock their savings in fixed-term accounts, which gives higher remuneration, but reducing savings.
As a result, loans of middle class are increasing.
In the last six months, half of our new loan was taken by consumers with the best credit rating.
The expectation of lifelong loans is a clear concern for the big rechard hamas of the financial problems of the Equifax Company TD Group.
He says: Fugao reached a high level of 6 months in August, due to the recent increase in interest rates and limited wages, it is a matter of concern that a large number of people take loans without real expectation of being able to return.

And this is the most common form of credit card for adult group, which costs 30 per cent more per month than paying.
Boyal adds: We are looking at the people using pension freedom to pay a 55 year old age, which affects their well-being in retirement.
Sometimes this is the only saving that has been effectively forced to do it.
People also think that they will use equity to repay them in their property - but this is a problem because they do not always need to get the required funds.
The future reduction in the property process will accelerate this.

I am a victim of sexual exploitation.
On Sunday morning, adviser to President Callean Conve said that he was suffering from a sex attack.
Convey responded sharply during the last week's Juba of Nomini, Jez Breat Cavenou and Aropi, Christine Blassy Ford of the Supreme Court.
In response, Convey emotionally declared that he himself had become a victim of sex attacks in the past and saves Kevanou to host Jack Tepper, saying that he believes that he was chosen by caste attackers against him.
I feel very condolences to the people who have been victims of racial attacks and racial violence and sacrifices.
I am a victim of sex attacks, Convey said at the State of the Union programme of CNN on Sunday.
I am suffering from a sex attack, I don't expect to be responsible for Jaz Kevenou or Jack Taper or Jaffe Flake or anybody.

The Senate Judicial Committee listened to the two sides after sending a letter to the Ford Senator Dian Finstein with details of its objections to the judge.
When the letter was announced, Ford and Kevanou said that they would be ready to speak to the Committee.
During her juba, Ford said that it is 100 per cent certain that Kevenou was the person who had tried to attack him in a domestic party in the early 1980s and could be a case of misinterpretation.
In an emotional initial statement, 51 year old said that it felt that it was a citizen's duty to come forward.
I'm afraid, he said.
I am here because I believe that it is my citizen obligation to tell you what happened to me when Breat Kevanou and I were in high school.
Kevenou, who had laid down the objections made by the Ford, and two other women, had denied them, and said that I have never attacked anyone - not in high school, not in college or never in college.
He said that some goods have been modifying from anywhere - even if it comes from a distance or Apriya, it will obstruct the vote of my nomination.
These are the last moments, pure and simple.

The head of Italy and the Governor of its Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's devolution will be sustainable after the Lok Sabha government has announced a significant increase in the expenditure in the deficit expenditure next year.
At the end of Thursday, the 5-Star Movement against the Act and the ruling parties formed by the Left Wing League had proposed the deficit of 2019, which was 2. 4 per cent of total GDP, which is three times the target of previous governance.
The announcement took place in the markets on Friday, in which the sel-off and banking shares of the bonds were seen.

President Sergeo Meterella addressed the gathering of the President's palace, which marked the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, noted that the founding law of the State requires a balanced budget and sustainability.
We are for the safety of our fellow citizens, he added.
Shortly after a summit in Central Italy, the Governor of Italy, Egnazio Visco, said that the country's god, 131 percent of GDP should not increase the largest European Union economy.
According to the ANSA State News Agency, WISCO said, Italy needs to move towards public and private investment and incorporate and reduce publication.

The ruling parties had pushed the economy Prime Minister Jiovanni Treya, who is an economist, who is not associated with any group to sign their plans to increase the expenditure.
Italy media said that Meterala had unsuccessfully tried to keep Treaty's GDP below 2.
The head and the Central Bank have no direct role to play in making economic policy.
Annual principal can deny the law and send it back to Parliament, but it can only do it once.
Later, the Parliament can pass it again, unchangedly, and it is necessary to adhere to the law.

The Geophysics Agency of Indonesia warned Sunami after 34 minutes that hundreds of magnificent mosaics were killed and more than thousands of unemployed were killed on the north-eastern coast of Sulavesi Islands.

The Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had to face criticism on social media in which the tsunami warning was taken up very soon.
The agency said that they followed the standard operating process and called for elimination of awareness on the basis of data available from nearest 200 km (125 miles) from Paulu.

Therefore, we used the data that was available to us and coaled on the basis of it. In BMKG, the earthquake and the Sunami Centre were waiting for Triono.
He said that the nearest recruitment gauge, which transforms the maritime level, was only six centimetres (2. 5 inches) of Mamuli wave and Paulu is not responsible for the nearest large journal.
If there were tide gauge or proper data in Paulu, we would certainly have done it.
This is something we have to evaluate for the future, Triono said.
Sunami, the officers who had said that the rapid speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour in Paulu and the surrounding areas was not clear before taking up the warning or afterwards.
On September 2, 2018, the residents of Palu, Indonesia, after their stay in Tsunami, examine the death of their families.
On the basis of video broadcast on social media, we guess that the warning had come to Sunami before the finished in an official manner, Triono said.

According to the National Disaster Accident Agency (BNPB) of Indonesia, it was held in 12 and 168 by tsunami.
Baptist Gonbert, geographist innovator of Oxford University, said that the creation of tsunami through the earthquake was surprising.
On Friday, the earthquake was recorded as a strike-slip event where neighbouring technic plates surround each other, which usually produces tsunami.
He said that there is an AV block that under the ocean, there was a lot of water being laid and caused by tsunami. He added that the narrow Gulf might have focused on the strength of moja moving forward towards the shore.
Disaster Agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroh told reporters that Sunami's warning was over suddenly, and his team was preparing to send aheer warnings.
The Ministry of Communications said that there were frequent warnings sent to the residents by the text message, but Nugroh said that the earthquake had destroyed the power and communication lines of the region and there was no siren on the sea shore.
Indonesians took BMKG to social media for tsunami's warning and timely publication of information.
How unhealthy... warning was taken... even if Sunami came... a Twitter user, anogucy, told BMKG in the direct message.

While protecting Erdogan on a visit to Berlin by German Copps, the name Nio-Nazi was used as codeword - RTW World News
A pair of police officers from Eastern Germany said that Turkish President Erdogan, who had visited Berlin this week, used the name of a renowned militant Nio-Nazi to work during the operation.
The Regional Interior Ministry said that the Criminal Police Electoral in Eastern German State Sexoni is questioning two members of the anti-terrorism unit SEK.
During his expected visit to Germany, men were kept for the protection of Turkish President Risep Type Erdogan.
The officers were required to use the codnam because they had to work under-cover.
He was chosen by Uve Bohnhardt, a notorious member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU), a Neo-Nazi rebel group who killed eight Turkish Emigrants, one Greek citizen and German police officers in the decade of 2000.
The strange codename came out when both of them signed to exchange the internal documents issued in the local media report.
The in-charge officers of the operation responded quickly and the police officers were called immediately.
Sexony's force was the first to respond to the police's senior petrochemical clain.
He said that the use of Bohnhardt was fortunately mine in foolishness and demonstrates the devastating calculations of those who suffered and their relatives.
Sexoni's Interior Minister Rolland Wallare gave these words an alarming, terrible and totally inappropriate.
There has been a significant debate in Germany during the visit of Berlin to Eddogan on Friday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been asked to host a leader who is more authoritarian.
Merkel said that the visit is very important because individual meetings are necessary to address when there is a gap.
NSUs first came to light in 2011 when the dead bodies of Bohnhardt and its allies Uve Mandalos were found inside the burnt motorhome in East Germany.
The two City of Christian City is believed to have died in suicide after an unsuccessful bank robber.
Beat Jesseney, the third and last Northern member of the Nio-Nazi group, was stopped shortly after.
In July this year, the German Court punished him with a conviction in 10 murders and sentenced him to jail.
Though he refused to be a part of the murders, he said that he believes that he is ethically blamed for failing to stop the murder.
The Kauband near the NSU has resulted in a comprehensive vacuum of German security agencies.

Resolution of SEC to be posted as Chairman of Tesla pays 20 million punishments
Alon Musc has addressed the US Security and Exchange Commission, which claimed to have dragged the text on privatisation tweets.
Moscow will have to resign from the post of Chairmen, but will continue to maintain the status of the CEOs.
According to Settlement Filing, Musc has 45 days to descend as Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Textiles and it is prohibited to take over for three years.
It will also have to pay 20 million punishments.
And because this whole thing had been started on tweets, either with carelessness or intended to say about the textiles of Muscow or to post it will have to be obtained, in some form, including posts on social media, but it is not limited, such as Twitter, the company's website, Press Release and Investor Coals.
Tesla will have to pay more than 20 million to address the failed claims to treat the initial tweet of MSC.
The SEC's complaint dragged investors on Musc through a tweet on August, in which he said that it has raised the fund to make the textiles private and take it at a price of 420 per share, which increased the company's share by more than 10.
Immediately denouncing his point of view, MsK said that he would keep Tesla privacy and expose the fury of investors.
The SEC had blamed the initial words of Musc because they were misinterpreting and misinterpreting because there was no basis in reality.
Musc himself claims that he was an authentic mistake, wrote in a blog post that it was under the print that he secured funds in a meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian Supreme Property Fund.
Mosc and the SEC were found to be close to the low-prisoned adjustment, which had imposed a ban on the Musc to become a chairman for two years and there was no need to accept any offence, but Muscow retreated support on Thursday.
After that, on Friday, Tesla fell into the shark, looking at it again changed its mind and accepted tough conditions.
However, like the old deal, there is no need for the Musc to accept the offence of investors who have been wrongfully transmitted.
Alexandria is pledged to support the certified Ukrainian Church, which requests conservative unity.
Alexandria's eldest theodor II has shown support for the church, which is a part of Moscow.
It comes in a sequence between the Russian Rudichust Church and the Constantinopal Petricate.
Theodor reached South Ukrainian city of Odisha on Thursday, and met high church delegates and conservative delegates.

The Orthodox Church has recently faced a major crisis in recognition of the independence of the Ukrainean Rudhichust Church.
Later, Russian Orthodox is a constitutional part of the church, which is also known as Moscow Petriarket.
Constantinopale has decided to send its Exercise to the Kive, which effectively violates the rule, in which an orthodox church is prohibited to intervene in other matters of church.
Exercise is a special representative, who has a technologically higher position in the church sequence as compared to Metropolitan Onfroye, which is the current head of the Ukrainian Rudichust Church of Moscow Petriachart.
Moscow responded to the functioning of the Petriarket Constantinopal, led by the Constantinopal representatives or co-chaired by the Church Services and the joint functioning of the Membership in every structure.
However, this decision was called awareness against more adverse measures for costension and does not put a complete break on interactional relations.

Major issues of UN address in Lavarovan
In the UN, Russian Foreign Prime Minister Sergey Laurove had attacked the State Blackmail and the global force of the West, and said that the diplomats should not pave the way for pro-active and unilateral barriers.
Foreign Prime Minister Laurove told the UN General Assembley on Friday that efforts were made to maintain self-determined positions as global leaders and some Western powers were not unhappy in bringing pressure on others.
He did not name the nations, but said that they use state blackmails, economic pressures and global power.
Through small groups of countries, these selfish aspirations will be to pay higher prices to the world.
Laurov, who was Russian ambassador to the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the replacement of politics's culture and dialogues has been replaced by unilateral and unilateral approvals without the approval of the UN.
The Minister highlighted the obstacles of US decades old Cuban, where such controls which extend to dozens of countries are illicit or unemployed.
Larove said that history does not teach us anything, and added that some Western equivalents are sufficient to blame anyone.
We remember that these injustice claims were used to support and promote wars, such as the Bomb Draw of Yugoslavia, the attack on Iraq in 2003 and the period in Libya in 2011.
The list of invasions under the Western Leaders was not comprehensive, as Lavarov refers to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest examples.
An unsuccessful attempt to eradicate governance in Damascus - which was carried out by linking the extremists - could have defeated the whole country and could have guided the terrorist conflict.
Laurove complimented the peace process of Astna jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, which helped prevent Islamic States (IS, ISIS and other groups from suppressing Syria.
It is a priority to rebuild war-friendly places in the country and help the refugees return safely to their homes.
Returning to the great Shakti Competition, Larove said that the UN was actually created from the rights of the lessons learned from the World War.
The Russian Foreign Prime Minister noted that in 2018, 80 years of the Urban Monique Agreement will be completed, in which the German-West Partnership of Czechoslovakia was agreed to approve the German-West Partnership in the Hood to please France and the UK Hitler.
Although British senior Prime Minister Neville Chamberlane claimed that the Monique Agreement meant peace for our time, the war started after a year.
Laurove said that the human reliance shows us how far the neglect of national egoism and international law can go.
The colonial era should be presided over and forcefully inserted or inserted into the waste of history.
According to the Level, Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can reach any challenge arising out of global issues.
If you have any questions or claims to someone, talk to them, show the facts, listen to the lamps of yourself, try to balance your interests.

The idea of Alabama Backup uarter Bank is likely to be concluded on Saturday to resume this season.

Tua Tagovailoa had supplied hearts as a starter in this season, but Krimson Tide coach Nick Sub said that there is a plan to take advantage of the skill group of Hearts.
In the last season, Alabama, who was guided at the National Championship Game in front of Georgia, was transferred to the second half by Tagovailoa, who defeated Crimson Tide in the 26-23 victory.
The former SEC legislative Player of the Year, Herts entered the season, posted 26-2 Vikram Post and started 28 matches for Alabama.

Owens: Design needs to work on the idea of signature.
The huge receiver desert brand of the former Dallas Counse estimates that it will be rolled into NFL in a short time.
The Holl of Famer Terrail Ovens said that the time will not come soon.
Answering a question on Twitter when they plan to sign with the team, Briant gave a tweet on Friday: Jaldi.
Three times the select of the pro bowl has been without a brand since the Dallace Council left it in the mid-April dispute.
Briant, who had denied the offence of the deal with the Baltimore Revenue and was constantly linked to the Claveland Brown, used to say before the season that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with the team.
Avenues, who attended the Prof. Hall of Fame in August and still announces to visit NFL, told TMJED that the attention of the briant should be returned to the field immediately.
Ovens told the website that he goes into the team and proves to be able to do what he does.
Because, if you hear all the critics, then it feels that one step has been lost, it is not a person who was once, it feels like it is.
These points go to sports, rosters, even if there is any money - then it is a one-year deal, a two-year deal, whatever it can happen - and show everybody you can do, which you can do.
Briant, team leader, had six receptions 838 yards and six ducks with Dallas in 2017.
Without a two-year 100-yard exhibition, Karkirdi-Lamba has gone to 23 regular seasonal sports.

He advised the Aventure that by the vision of the General Manager or the owner, when he feels that your efficiency is decreasing, you will not be able to keep an official or collector for the money you are really looking for.
It is a warning that if the Briant does not find his way to the roster in the near future, it will not be made later, Ovense said that the confrontationers should follow the idea of reconnecting with the counterparts.
Owens, who made 38 downs in three seasons with Dels, said, "I don't know whether the relationship is broken or not.
I am thinking of this day, if the Coboys welcomed it back and got the opportunity, it would be synonymous for Desse and Frenchism.
