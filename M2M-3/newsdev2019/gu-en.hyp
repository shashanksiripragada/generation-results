When will the doors of the house be opened for a woman in the periods
My newly married Sakhi had told me about two weeks ago that he is preparing for the first text of his third.
The third is mainly a festival celebrated in North India, which is celebrated with the prayer of happiness and marriage.
Thirdly, married women fast all day and worship every night.
While talking to me, I felt immense enthusiasm and happiness in the voice of Sakhi.
Sakhi took a new sari to wear on the third day and put henna in both hands.
I also agreed to see it happy, but its periods started on the third morning.
After that, both his mother and mother-in-law refused to worship and worship him.
The other women of the house also advised my Sakhi to stay away from the prayer room and did not even forget to touch the luggage of worship.
My Sakhi was also told to stay away from other women living in the third volume.
Periods and Ghar Temple Entrance
After that incident, when Sakhi talked to me almost crying again, I felt as if somebody had blossomed in my heart.
I had the idea of the enthusiasm of my Sakhi and his preparation for the third.
Once again we saw the photographs of henna obtained on the watts wrap and my eyes suddenly got wet .
I said in anger that Tare had to leave such a religion along with Third, which decides to enter the temple due to periods instead of love and snake in the star heart.
On Friday morning, the news of the Supreme Court's order to remove the restrictions on the entry of women in Sabarimala temple was flashing together on a number of TV screens, I remembered the story of my Sakhi and Third in Bhopal.
What was the debate of the Sabarimala temple
The entry of women from 10 to 50 years of age in Sabarimala Temple in Kerala was prohibited so far.
Considering one of the main pilgrimages of the Hindus, this restriction has been implemented for hundreds of years.
Behind this discrimination, the logic of the administration of the temple was such that Lord Ayyappa, who was sitting inside the temple, was a brahmacharya forever.
Therefore, women who are at the age of menstruation cannot go there and worship.
The Indian Young Loyers Association challenged the ban on the temple by filing an application for public interest in the Supreme Court in 2006.
After hearing the twelve years of hearing and for hours, the five members of the Supreme Court heard their repayment on 28th September, 2018.
What did the Supreme Court say
Bada Judiciary Deepak Mishra, Justice R.
Nariman, Justice A.M.
The ban on entry of women in the temple was termed as a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution while paying it to the Constitutional Constituencies of Khanvilkar and Justice Chandrachud.
Khandpeeth said that no one should be allowed to worship in the temple without discrimination.
Justice Indu Malhotra, the fifth and only female judge of the Constitutional Constituent, had disagreeed with the decision of the remaining four judges and the Court had given above 4-1.
Artificial dust of superstition
I had seen my brother-in-law's face in reading about the court's payments.
My younger brother-in-law had started the period two years ago.
He told me one day in a terrible voice that when he was in the period, grandmother had refused to go to the room of Lord Ji.
Besides, it has also been decided to reach the kitchen and touch the bases.
Bhatri ji had told me that on the day Mommy made me a vibrant crown.
I don't remember that my periods were going on.
Therefore, I had gone to the kitchen running to get rid of the bitterness.
He had asked me why he was so angry with her mother.
I had no answer to his question.
My far-flung brother-in-law is asking for an answer from us.
The question is, the Supreme Court took up the restrictions on entry of women in Sabarimala, but when will we remove the irrelevant dust of superstition on our path
When will we open our home temples, our kitchens and the doors of our heart for women passing through periods
Periods or menstruation is a common biological process related to reproduction in the body of women .
How can the process which is the creation of the creation and the cause of the existence of the human being be irrelevant
Further, if a woman is inadequate for five days of the month, then we should end such criteria of sacredness.
The Supreme Court can stand in front of the world with bonds, but the question is, when will we stand behind the second half of our population as a society

Repatriation with Alster Lambreta Club
Lambretas was an essential assistant in the late 1960s.
The spirit of the era is being kept alive by a group of enthusiasts from Italian motor scooters.
About 100 scooters from the entire UK and Ireland traveled to Co Fermanagh after 70 years after the formation of the first ulcer lambretta club at the end of this week.
One of the two members of the original club, Chris Wils, bought his first lambretta in 1966.
The scooter was just a form of transportation for me, but it was also an option to use it for other things.
It was like a little sports.
I have never come to a late scene and now I am very old for it, he said.
It was basically affordable and reliable in the quantity and was available at the right price and once you have it, you can only do other things while riding on A to B place.
He used to race lembretta in the Time Trial around T.T. Circuit on the oil of man.
The first ultra-lambreta club was set up at the beginning of the decade of the 10th, but it was revised 12 years ago.
I thought that in the scooters, interests and difficulties in other transport forms did not help the club normally, so I thought that it was just, just, finished, Chris.
After that, some time ago, people were interested in it and it appears to have grown even more.
Philip Steel is the Member Secretary, Alster Lambretta Club, who is currently a member.
Everyone has shown its own share.
It will be the people affected by the entire late scene, and it has started a lot of truth from there.
Others are in the racing scenes, in the investments, there is a mixture of all kinds of people.
Some people are just about Vintage.
Many scooters were customized and no two scooters were equal.
You can keep it originally or roam around 35 or 40 MPHs, which were originally built to go to smaller shares of Italy, but some people tune it.
Some of the tune bicycles here can probably go above 100 MPHs.
At the end of the week, some breaks and pushes had to be started there.
And when the climate in Northern Ireland is not always pleasant like the Italian home of Lambretta, the sun was shining due to the scooters traveling around the County Fermanagh.
Ruth Davidson orders for Tori Breaksite Moun
Ruth Davids has given a mandate for a silent period between his responsive colleagues so that the elder Prime Minister can get a brakestick deal above the limit.
The Scottish Tori leader said that there was enough time for discussion in the two years after the European Union's vote.
Its comments follow the description of the Checkers Scheme of Boris Johnson as diverse and completely informal.
He told BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that it is now time to go behind the big Prime Minister.
Since Tory workers joined Burmingham for their party conference, he said: "The time has come for discussion for the last two years.
Former Foreign Secretaries were one of the greatest offices of the state when most of the schemes were being planned and appreciated it at the beginning of November last year.
Now it is time to go behind the big prime minister, to give them a chance to complete the passages and to provide service to the country.
In the context of silence, I would be welcomed by him.
The comments were made by former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson after another intense interaction in the Braxit Dialogue.
From the back Theresa MA told the BBC's Andrew Mar program that the Checkers Scheme has the ability to provide an accurate free trade deal with the European Union, and thus insisting that it believes in the bracket.
Smt. Davids also said that the second Scottish will be shaking in the forthcoming elections with the commitment of the Declaration to prevent freedom from democracy as it promised the people of Scotland in 2014 that it would be once in the event of one generation.
Asked about the order for any other public opinion on Bracket Soda, he said: In the context of our history in Scotland, I have repeatedly spoken about this fact that if you are a nationalist then you cannot re-drive democracy because you have not achieved the desired results.
I would have been very happy if I had said that you can re-drive this bracket democracy because I did not have the result of which I had done the brokers.
M8 completely opened after the police incident
The M8 Motorway in Glassgo has been completely reopened after a police incident has been closed.
The police said that the road was closed in both directions on the Junction 15 Townhead between the concern for the well-being of the waiting.
As a result of this dam, the road was completely stable for three hours and the traffic devastation in the city, where the Great Scottish Run has been organized.
Thereafter, a 20-year-old man was taken to the Glassgo Royal Infrastructure for examination.
Christine Blacy Ford ' s friend Brett Caveno explains the statement of the said attack .
The high school friend of Dr. Christen Blasi Ford, Land Keiser, who had two adolescents, had imposed a specific attack on Nomini Breat Caveno of the Supreme Court, wrote a letter clarifying to the Senate Judicial Committee, although he did not remember the House Party where the said misconduct was carried out, but he considers Ford responsible.
Kisser had earlier announced a statement by his Attorney saying that he did not remember the questioning party, and he never remembered the meeting with Cavenou.
In its jubani before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Kevenou used to offer Keiser's statement as a proof of its indiscriminateness, yet he had to say that Keiser had said that he had trusted the Ford.
After the Republican Sen Jeff Flake and other intermediaries, the senators demanded a week long delay on the full senate vote on the confirmation of the cavenou to give time for the investigation, President Trump suggested that the FBI should be conducted within a week on Friday.
On Saturday, Keiser told the Committee through his lawyer in a letter that he was ready to cooperate fully with the supplementary investigation of the Cavenoune FBI.
However, as my client has already made it clear, he does not know the same judge Caveno and never remember that he was in the party or he cannot remember whether he was present with Dr. Ford or where and where he was present.
It also said that Keiser does not give radio to Dr. Ford's responsibility, and he has already told the press that he considers Dr. Ford's responsibility.
The simple and unchanged truth is that they are unable to support it because they have no memory of the event of making it.
A friend of Cavenou, Mark Judge, who was present during the attack, also said that he would cooperate in the FBI test.
The residents of Chicago, who have been wrongly slaughtered, remember the corrupt police and their lives under the Gang.
The top lawyer of Illinois is trying to reverse the foundations of the disappointing period of the history of the Chicago Police.
It is believed that a wicked police attacked innocent residents of a housing project, who hunted dozens of people on artificial operations.
So far, 42 misdeeds have been treated as innocent.
The IDA B Wells Housing Project, where a group of Chicago's corrupt police attacked the residents of almost a decade free of fear, there is only one empty pot left.
Sergeant Ronald Vots was his leader.
Residents have filed false police reports, made evidence and attacked them and their unarmed strategic groups.
Cookie County State Attorney Kim Fox has two of which Willy Martin and Claon Glover have been defected so far.
If you had not supported it, then you were deteriorating.
You were against it.
You were against the same way of operating and getting funds, Clone Glover told the vote.
"I was scared.
I was trying to go away, he got out of his friend.
I didn't have to go anywhere, Willy Marty told me.
The lawyers of the FOCS Free Integrity Unit are reviewing 30 to 40 additional cases related to WATS.
Landen Alley, a resident of IDA B. Wells Housing, told that many people speak about votes.
Speaking, he said.
But it doesn't make any difference.
Other former residents, as directed by Clerissa Baker, had a word before a sergeant with the bed.
It has its own gang.
So who will trust us
Baker said.
The Joshua Teffer of the University of Chicago Dross Relief Project is a reply unless there is none recently.
They put it forward because they had seen these people as vacuum jobs and did not care about them because they are black people in the housing project, who were blamed for the potholes in their minds.
Sergeants went to jail in 2013 and remained in jail for 22 months to try to steal from the FBI's acquaintance.
Because of votes - Martiz Vice also went to jail.
During that time I had only my son.
I was away from it for four years.
Fortunately, I knew who I was because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him.
Four years have been snatched without any crime.
Blockchain, virtual reality and AI have two years old fidelity on the future.
Prior to becoming a Corporate Bossword for Fedelity 2018, he identified the potential of blockchain.
CEO AB Johns carried the air forward to cryptocurance, which was one of the most dangerous and unstable wealth classes of last year.
A few years ago, I and some other senior officials were just eager to know what was going on here, especially for Bitcoin, and told Johns.
We started simultaneously so that we could say, "We have started understanding this."
This gigyasa started excavating bitcoin at one place in New Hampshire, while the price of cripts was about 180.
In December last year, when Betcoin grew to about 20,000, Johns told Johns that the price has increased and suddenly we are earning such money that never washed away.
He has not mentioned how many bitcoins have been excavated or how much fidelity has earned.
Physicians are clearly interested in the matter.
The Blockchen Club, Seminars, Office Hours and Meatups known as Bits and Blocks for its employees now have around 2,600 members.
The company has a coinbase that allows Fedelity customers to examine their cryptocurance balance on Fedelity Mobile applications.
In 2015, he started simplifying Charitable Donation in Bitcoin.
Johns told that many other possible uses for Bitcoin and Cryptocarency have already been driven or kept by Abherai.
We are trying to listen to the market.
During this period, CAT Chase is exploring uses for both Heads of Strategy for Fidelity Centre for Applied Technology and Blockchain Incubators (JET is part of FCAT), Public Blockchain and Enterprise Blockchain.
Chase could not specifically comment on projects but he said that he has seen a lot of interest from the consumers and partners and their employees.
It is still very new.
Cheze said that if you are studying all these things, if you can examine it in depth, it is still at the end of hypothesis.
We have tried to implement the blockchain in some examples where we learned a lot but technology is not very mature to solve these problems.
At present, the group focuses on some obstacles, he added.
They are looking at how to technicate physical things, for example, a piece of art, or how to use blockchains in supply chain space.
But we feel that they will be back and Cheze said.
When feedelity starts, it will be well decorated.
He used the example of a pable watch that failed by retail standards, but something that paid for fitness.
The group created an application for smartwatch, which was closed by collecting lakhs of funds through a Croudfund Kickstarter campaign.
When Apple Watch came to the market, fidelity was ready.
He used an application developed for a pable for faster livelihood on the new product of the app.
We don't have such a condition that the pable watch is a big thing but if we have people wearing this on our throat, we should also be there, he said.
He taught us that when Smart Watch came into a collective market, and we were able to stay there.

My father used to say with Row Ved repeatedly that in other matters, especially in other cases, the court was actually trying to get inside and solve the cultural issues that seemed to be solved in the elections and the legal process, he added during his visit to Fox and Friends.
By trying to short-circuit the process, the Supreme Court caused greater damage and consequently, the battles for nomination and nutrition of the Supreme Court became more hot because the Justice took the role which was held in the House.

In the context of hot-button cases, Skelia said that it is not so rare to be angry for justice.
It is true that Justice Kevenou was perhaps more aggressive, but it was because Sanjogo was very different.
He saved his good name from unsuccessful attacks.
Kevano, on Thursday, approved the Judicial Committee of the Senate to move forward to the entire Senate Floor vote through party-line 11-10 votes.
In the dramatic moments, Sena Jeff Flake, R-Ariz said that it will give its decisive swing vote in the side of Cavenou only if the FBI is given a week's term to examine the claims of current and credible misconduct in front of Cavenou.

Approximately a century ago, the Paris Coucher House, established by Elsa Shaypreli, has launched the clothes and handbags ready to wear it.
For a label that has always celebrated the imagination of wearing, it is the famous hat of Alsa Shaypreli, which was the size of the shoe from above.
Though there is a long history of severity till now, this fashion house has some modernity.
Beautiful is emotional jeva, all lobsters, heart and eye shape.
Shaypreli had designed the first jumpsuit in 1930, and was the first to set the catwack show in music.
She was Shaipareli and Sheni's friends Salvador Dali, who had discovered art-fashion collaboration, who was currently a partner of Calvin Clean and Raff Simons with US artist Sterling Rubby.
The myth is that Dali wants the Lobster-Ambroidery Evening Gown, which he and Cypreli made to display in the salon with the dressing of the actual meonage, but it was rejected.

We want to deliberate on this idea of collaboration, which is part of the history of beautification, Burrand Guy, who has been a creative director in the sloon of Place Vendom's house for the last three years.
For radi-to-wire storage, he took the friendship with Man Ray as an initial point and made clothes based on economic artworks in partnership with Man Ray Foundation.

It will be available at Retail Price at a cost of Rs. 5,000.
Paris Fashion Week's architectural side was also exhibited at the pop-up shop at the Warehouse on the right side of the Sen River, which was recently sold at the Ikia collection of classical Abloh.
Half an hour before the inauguration, there was a length of a strong queue of 5000 Abloh enthusiasts who were enthusiastically excited to buy a design without a feeling of tags coming from their Louis Viton Mansver.
For Abloh, the project opens communication channels with comprehensive observers to provide spectacular fashion or designer furniture.
No one has much property, but if you are aware of a certain chair, it is part of your dinner conversation.
He recently said that it is a train of millennium thoughts.
Observers started swinging in the past on the sketboards in a garage at Marines, it was clear that this is not a day for ordinary catwake show.
Andrea Kronthaler, husband of Viewen WestWood and a designer of his own authority, Jessica Fulford-Dobson of Lady Scatboards in Kabul, was described as the first point to see men and women in colorful free clothes.
Some women - and some men - were sketched in a diamonded mule sandal, although they were on foot in round platform shoes.
Wastewood, who saw a horse-print hair and a orange carding dress tied around its waist from the first hallow, joined her husband to the catwack for the last bow, where she presented her flowers.
Strong links of joints - in pictures
Born in Detroit, Peter Jelevasky, a photographer in London, started his work in Street Photography four years ago.
As a portrait photographer and a human being, I have always been attracted by links, which have been listening to you about a wonderful binding.
It was never intended to be a complete project, but when I took the portrait of the first set of journals, it became a big dishes and there was no way to return from there.
The upcoming books, twins, 44 sets of similar linkages showcases the pictures and conversations of Jelevaski.
This project is primarily a visionary type, says: It is not a document or a scientific project - my main aim was to make people's powerful, emotional portraits.
Nurse passes confidence vote in the federation on Pe-Deal Handling
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, who are angry with the behavior of changes in the NHS salary deal, have voted to pass the pace of confidence in the organisation for misrepresentation of the required wage increase.
Ex-General Secretary General Davis acknowledged that it came after a long-term story within the RCN that it had misrepresented the members to increase the urgent wages of 3 in this year after the end of the 1 wage cap.
Many people were disappointed with non-availability of the required increase in wages, due to which Davis had fallen under the pressure of members, resulting in a vote of confidence in the Council of College at a general meeting in Bermingham on Friday.
Authentic and open discussion of Burmingham made the air clear and consequently the college will emerge strong, said RCN President Maria Trivern.
"This vote is clear and the Council and Management of RCN has received a message.
In recent weeks, the Council has already driven forward the change in the institution, the members to hear and involve them very closely and will continue.
A meeting will be held next week and it is expected that members of the RCN Council will return.
Nursing is based on the Trust, a NHS nurse told the Guardian.
The proceedings of the RCN Council have destroyed our belief and they have to go.
I hope they will take respectable steps and follow the request.
I look forward to seeing whether or not the members of other organisations are looking for equal solutions.
Rachel Herison, GMB National Officer for NHS, told the Guardian in August: NHS employees have opened their wage hacks up and down in the country and they understand that the wages they thought were not increased.
And they're angry.
Prior to an extraordinary meeting, RCN acknowledged that it had made a lot of mistakes in the 2018 Payments Soda and its communication process.
However, it is stated that RCN's Scrap the Cap campaign had obliged the government to abolish the wage cap, which increased only 6. 5 per cent on wages, will now be presented in three years.
The vote came after the independent report that the presentation of RCN's deal was turned to its acceptance, when Davis was not imposed to stop the testing of Soda.
It is claimed that RCNA had submitted a genuine fact that the members could not give familiar orders regarding Soda, when alternative options were not examined.
RCNA has published contradictory information whether it will require 3 increase for all members or why.
In a separate briefing before the Congress of RCN, the delegates were misinterpreted that 3 will increase and growth will increase.
In fact, there is an increase in 3 increase in wages and in any case, only some of the top employees of their wage bands will soon increase it.
The Electronal Reform Service, who had taken this report, said that the information given to the members about the implementation of the provision was sudden after the Congress (as a result of an effort to simplify the message).
ERS believes that failure to find out the decision-making persons in comparison to the present decision, which was clearly comparison to the proposed provision, prevents the notified decision as it has failed to provide a clear reference to the Headline benefits of 6.
3. 4 percent of the RCN members passed the pace of confidence vote with 8 percent.
Linds iron, Instagram Live observers, as they try to 'hijack' family children in the same share.
After posting live videos on Instagram, Lindse Iron is being vaccinated in which the households of the same share are trying to separate the poor children from their parents.
Perhaps life videos shooting in Moscow (on the basis of earlier instagram stories updates) offers a roof to a family dragon at night, but the situation becomes full shortly.
Friends, I just want to show you a family which I had received, he told the audience, "A Syrian refugee family, which I really think about.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me
Come along with me, I will take care of you, so before roaming towards a child, he tells the family: Do you want to stay in the hotel tonight
Do you want to see films
It will enjoy watching movies on TV or computer.
When parents deny, iron becomes provocative.
He says, "Your sons should not be kept on the ground, you should work hard and you should do what you can for your children so that they can live a better life."
Anyone who gives them houses and beds, give them what I do.
They'll come back to you.
I will not go from here until I take you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't fuck with me
When the family tries to stay away from iron, it goes behind it, the transmission of Instagram Live is still going on.
Yes, what is happening, they are manipulating children and by doing this you are spoiling the Arabic culture.
We are taking these children, they want to go.
Children, I am with you, do not worry, today the whole world is watching this.
At the end of the video, the situation comes to hand when Mother is seen gathering with iron.
The video clips are spreading on social media, in which some users have suggested that it is an attempt to misbehave.
The Independent has contacted the Iron Representative for commenting.
The third part of Britain believes that they will never pay their gods.
Almost third of the British people believe that they will never be able to fulfil their gods during their lifetime and more than one of the 10 people say that they will not be able to reduce their pay scales.
Research by Equipex and Gorka, especially by The Indipendent, shows that people of 18 to 24 years of age especially believe that they face life loans, only half of them say that they will be able to return in black.
According to a report released by an institution of fish studies last year, students graduate with an average of 46,000, and graduates with more than 5,000 graduates from the poorest graduates.
In fact, most graduates - 81 will never pay their dues fully, which means that they will spend the first 30 years of their work with hanging on them.
The level of overall delivery in the society is increasing, the figures of the office of National Statistics show that the UK has a home loan record higher, while the British spends more than 100 per year.
But how should we worry about this fear of depression-driven data
Livelihood relations with loans have become normal now - not just for small people but for the entire population
For example, sometimes we buy the largest after home (who we are indebted) then it is a motor car.
This week, the Auto Trader cautioned that all new cars will be purchased on finance in a decade, as we look forward to payments for our motoring changes.
Director and Chartered Financial Planner Gini Boyle of Equal Investors, of course, believes that there has been a comparative change.
God is certainly more common now - Credit Cards are more prevalent, and in the same way, zero percent are also called balance transfers, student loans and daily wage creditors.
It was embarrassing to have a god for our grandmother's generation.
In recent times, students are usually borrowing in loans and home prices.
In the Interactive Investment, the personal financing of the individual financing is agreed and says that the result can be worrisome.
Those who want to buy a property worth four-five times your income, make a big amount, it does not seem to be a big deal.
And people will be in trouble at this place.
For many years, the rate of interest has been very low and people with big mortgage or other payments should keep in mind that when the rate increases, they need to be taken care of.
Perhaps it can be understood that critics of the finance industry appear to be trustworthy.
The Chief Executive Brian Brody of the Loan Agency Freedom Finance says: "God is not a bad word.
Loaning is no longer a simple solution for house reforms or buying new cars.
Low interest rates have inspired many people to lock their savings in fixed-term accounts, which provides higher turn, but has reduced savings access.
As a result, the middle class loans are increasing.
In the last six months, half of our new loans were taken by the best credit rating customers.
This expectation of livelihood loans is a clear concern for Equipex Company TD Group's big recharged Hames for financial problems.
It says: "Fugawa had reached a higher level of 6 months (2. ) in August, due to the recent increase in interest rates and limited wages, it is a matter of concern that large numbers of people take loans without real hope of real repayment.
According to our analysis, this year, individual liabilities will increase by 1 percent and is a record level of major contributor subscriber loans.
When people work and earn, God can be operated, but for old age, there is concern about what can be the meaning of comfort.
Research conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research with Equity Release Expert Mor 2 Life shows that in the age group of 55 to 4 years, the insecurity of people has increased more than the third in the last four years, which is twice as fast as the national average.
And this is the most common form of credit card for the adult group, which costs 30 per month.
Boyle adds: We see more and more people using pension freedom to pay 55 years of age, which affects their well-being in retirement.
Many times it is the only savings that have worked effectively to do it.
People also think that they will use equity for repayment of their property later, but this is a problem because it is not necessary to always get the required funds.
The future reduction in the property process will accelerate it.

Tests are very important.
Thank you for expelling yourself from the convenience sector - you are a goddess
As part of the I Tuch Myself Project, Berley also releases a new snackskin print, inspired by a cash star called The Chrissi.
100 BCNA benefits from Brah will be donated.
While self-determination, it is important for you to know the necessary signs and symptoms.
At the same time, other signs of breast cancer include size or shape of breasts , pimples or skin blisters , breast feeding , clots in skin , continuous pain or change in skin formation .
Likewise, swelling around the elbow or colour bone can become indicators like increasing nerves or vomiting dentives of breasts .
Women are advised to test their breasts every month.
If you see any symptoms of breast cancer then NHS suggests that you meet your GP as soon as possible .
After testing , if they feel that your symptoms need more evaluation then your GP will advise you to go to a specialist breast cancer clinic .
Adam driver in this SNL skit is so good that the cast cannot keep the face directly .
Adam driver was the guest guest of Sterday Night Live this week, and he actually gave 110 exhibition.
Show's entertaining sketch is always such that it is not in a certain current event, and in the new skit career day too.
At the American High School, the focus is on bringing your father to work on that day, where Kishore Mortdecai (Peat Davidson) unwillingly agreed to talk to his old father, Nawab father, Abraham H. Parnass (Adm driver).
Fighting with a wood, Parnassus possibly moves forward to showing strong responsibilities of the sovereignty of the oil industry, inspired by Daniel Planvae, eligible for Daniel Day Levis Ther Will Blood.
Parnasse told the students, "My birth took place in seven months, very early.
The incubation technology was just the beginning, so they kept me in the cast iron port within the pizza oven until I mature enough to walk.
My bones never became strong, but my soul became.
Strengthy and waste your enemies
Davidson, fellow SNL member, Eddie Brint, who plays the role of a school teacher, struggles to keep the face straight and the drive watching in the eyes is not visible in a dense sight.
Though the star warrior is in full force, he is becoming more and more fighting as he recalls his personal war with Oil Beron competitive HR Picins.
I have married Tari's daughter, it's okay.
Filling the stomach with my sharp seeds, the star has grown the boy, it is my last change, HRD
Within five minutes, Parnasas became as thrilling as the utensil of the Adam driver as Kilo Ray had done in two films.

"I am a victim of sexual exploitation"
President Calien Convey's adviser said on Sunday morning that he has become a victim of sexual attacks.
Convey responded to extensive exchanges during the last week of the Supreme Court's Nomini, Judge Brett Cavenou and Aropi, Christine Blasi Ford.
In response, Convey expressed emotionally that he himself has become a victim of sexual attacks in the past and saves cavenou to host Jack Tapper, saying that he believes that he had chosen sexual attacks against him.
I feel very condolences to the people suffering from caste attacks and sexual assaults and violence.
I am a victim of sexual attacks, Convey said Sunday at the State of the Union programme of CNN.
"I am suffering from sexual attacks, I don't expect Jack Caveno or Jack Tapper or Jaff Flake or anybody responsible for it.
You have to be responsible for your conduct.
Conveyed the network to compare the Aropes against Cavenou, which was directed on Cosbi, which was sentenced to three to ten years in Pennsylvania State Jail last week.
Convey also opposed the inability of the Senate Judicial Committee to expel former President Bill Clinton, despite having verbal sex at the Oval Office and lying on the direct interest of the American people.
ubani of Cavenou and Ford has divided the United States, demonstrates vote
In the US, there are differences on the jubani of Breat Cavenou and its complaint Aropi Christine Blacey Ford, in which Ford claims that Nomini of the Supreme Court had sexually attacked it when they were both young.
And the number of people calling Ford or Cavenou groups was similar, out of which 38 percent of the people said that they believe that Cavenou was probably or certainly wrong during his jubilee, while 30 percent of the people had said the same about the Ford.
The Senate Judiciary Committee heard from both sides after sending the letter to the Ford Senator Dian Fainstein, giving details of its objections before the Judge.
When the letter was announced, Ford and Cavenou said that they would be ready to speak before the Committee.
During his speech, Ford said that 100 per cent is certain that Kevenou was the only person who tried to attack him in a domestic party at the beginning of the 180s and could be a case of misidentification.
In an emotional initial statement, the 51-year-old said that he felt that it was his citizen's obligation to come forward.
I'm afraid, he said.
I am here because I believe that it is my citizen's duty to tell you what happened to me when Breat Cavenou and I were in high school.
Caveno, who had denyed the objections made by Ford, and two other women had imposed sexual exploitation on them and said that I have never attacked anybody - not in high school, not in college or not in college.
He said that some things come out and there is a surveillance in it, even if it brings it from far off or unpleasant, it will stop my nominee's opinion.
"This is the last moment mark, pure and easy.
Unsurprisingly, the results of the UGP, which were conducted on 2-28 September, were divided on the party lines, in which Democrats considered the Ford (3) and the Republic as Cavenoon (4) more than the Republican Ford (11 against 14).

4 million people from around the world have visited the repetitions of Body Worlds from 15th to now.
The Body Worlds London founder, Peterc, The Guardian told that the 28,000 square feet exhibition site is based on 100 of the donations received from people who have agreed to help live and educate so that people can see what is wrong.
We see and read a lot of terrible things that frighten us from death.
All of us are going to go there, that is what is common in us, we are going to die and I feel that the body world shows us that you do not need to be afraid, Tebernley said.

Freedom by sustainable writer professions
Are you ready for self-publishing 3.0
In a new White Paper published on SelfPub3. 0 today, Alliance of Independent Orders for the first time explains how writers can add to the category of other creative entrepreneurs to enhance their independence and build sustainable writer professions.
Orna Rose, the founder of the Alliance of Individual Authorities and one of the 100 influential people in publication will explain why and how writers should adopt Self-Publishing in the Digital Book World 2018.
Ross says that consumer varieties such as individual branding, precautionary use and advancement of mobile phone reading are combined with digital publication technology to create more favourable conditions for writer-business.
But only writers who have developed independent, creative and empowered ideas, who understand the value of their intellectual property, can benefit from these opportunities.
SelfPub3. 0 encourages writers that we have a variety of earnings through our own websites, which will become the hub of our successful publication and media enterprises.
The flow of income may include direct sales, subscription models, cross-source support, large distribution models and online education and other income flows.
Selfpub3. 0 also means using retailers and other services to distribute our books in the formats as much as possible.
Mostly, selfpub 3. 0 is a change in the mentality required to control your writer profession, whether it is a business-public or self-publication service, instead of handing over all your intellectual property to your most precious creative wealth to other ownership business.
These are the steps that enhance income, influence and print for writers and every writer and publisher working in the digital age should be interested, Rose guides that for real freedom writers or for anybody, it should be in original business and also in creative freedom.
This is the future now.
And it has never been so bright for free writers.
Self-Publishing was 1.0 desktop publishing and print on demand.
Self-Publishing was to sell e-books for e-selectors and phone users by 2. 0 online bookstors.
Now we are entering the age of Self-Publishing 3. 0: Self-Publishers create efficient and sustainable writer enterprises.
Alliance of Individual Rights is the only global, non-profit organisation of self-proof writers.
The objective of ALLI is to promote excellence and ethics in self-proliferation and support writers in making and selling their books and insist on the freedom of the writer through creation of sustainable digital businesses.
Heads of Italy, Central Bank warns Government on irrigation scheme
The Chief of Italy and its Governor of Central Bank on Saturday warned that the goddess of the country will remain sustainable after the Democratic Government announced a significant increase in fertilizer expenditure next year.
At the end of Thursday, the Rule 5-Star Movement and the Rules of the Right Wing League proposed the deficit of 2019, which was 2. 4 per cent GDP which is three times the target of previous governance.
The announcement took place on Friday in the markets, showing swings in bonds' cell-off and banking shares.
He also had a tactic with the European Commission, which supervises and implements the financial regulations of the EU.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the gathering of the Presidents Palace which marked the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, noting that the States founding law requires a balanced budget and sustainability of payment.
This is for the safety of our fellow citizens, he added.
After some time in a conference in Central Italy, according to the Italian Governor Ignazio Wisco Bank, the country's devotion, 131 percent of GDP, is the largest in the largest European Union economy, should not grow.
According to the Ensa State News Agency, WISCO said that Italy needs to move towards public and private investments and inclusion and reduction of publicity.
He added that the god should be kept on the path of humility.
League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matto Salvini also replied to the metrela that there has been an increase in control over the years imposed by Brussels.
In a statement, Salvini said, "Calm down, Mr.
Over the years of the budget imposed by Europe, we have exploded in our publication, we are altering the course and putting the future on the mortgage.
Earlier, before speaking to Metrala or Visco, 5-star leader Luigi D. Mao said that the budget will give people a return for the stealing of the past, but he added that the intention of the government is not to challenge the EU or the financial markets.
The ruling parties pushed the Economy Prime Minister Geovani Tria, who is an economist who is not associated with any group to sign their plans to increase the cost of funds.
The Italian media said that Materla had failed to keep Treya's GDP below 2.
Heads and Central Banks have no direct role to make economic policy.
 The annual head can reject the law and send it back to Parliament, but it can do only once.
Later, the Parliament can pass it again, in an unregulated manner, and it is necessary to bear it in law.
Indonesia's tsunami sensors devastated vast waves: official officer
Indonesia's Geophysics Agency warned a tsunami after 34 minutes that hundreds of socks were killed and more than thousands of people were killed after a major earthquake on the north-eastern coast of Sulavesi Island.
The ruins of a car in Tsunami, Palu, Indonesia on September 2, 2018.
The earthquake and tsunami of a rapid severity of 5. 5, which hit the city of Palu, about 1,500 km (40 miles) from Jakarta, and killed 384 people on the shore.
Officials said that the number of deaths is likely to increase.
On Friday, thousands of people gathered at the beach in Palu for the festival, when the waves of six meters (18 feet) were hiding, due to which many people died.
The Geophysics Agency (BMKG) had to face criticism on social media, in which many people raised questions about the tsunami's warning was taken very shortly.
The agency said that they followed the Standard Operating Procedure and called for ending the warning on the basis of data available from the nearest tidal sensor of 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
We don't have any observation data in Palu.
Therefore, we used the data that was available and collided on the basis of it, the big waiting trio of earthquakes and tsunami centres at BMKG said.
He said that the nearest Bharati gauge, which transforms the sea level, was only recording six centimeters (2.5 inches) Mamuli wave and was not responsible for the vast socks near Paulu.
If we had a tide gauge or a proper data, we would have done it.
This is something that we have to evaluate for the future, Triono said.
Tsunami, the officials who had said that the speed of hundreds of kilometres per hour in the Paulu and the surrounding area was not clear before taking up the warning.
On 2nd September, 2018, residents examine the deaths of their family members after grabbing in Tsunami, Palu, Indonesia.
On the basis of video broadcasting on social media, we guess that the warning was tsunami before the official end.
The worst destruction occurred on Boxing Day in 2004, when a heavy tsunami occurred due to an earthquake of 5, which killed 1,26,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including 1,26,000 people in Indonesia.
The charming city of Palu is situated on the narrow Bay of Northeastern Sulavesi and is a resident of around 380,000 people.
According to the National Disaster Accident Agency (BNPB), Indonesia, it was handled by the tsunami in 12 and 168.
Baptist Gombert, a geographical researcher of Oxford University, said that the creation of tsunami by earthquake was surprising.
Friday's earthquake was recorded as a strike-slip event, where neighbouring tectonic plates drive in front of each other, which normally produces tsunami.
He said that there is a hurdle that under the sea, landslides had occurred, which had displaced a lot of water and became the cause of tsunami. He added that the narrow Gulf could have focused on the strength of the socket moving forward towards the shore.
Sutopo Purao Nugroho, the adviser of the Disaster Agency, told the journalists that when the tsunami warnings were finished, their team was preparing to send warnings.
The Ministry of Communications said that the Text Message had repeatedly sent warnings to the residents, but the leaders said that the earthquake had stalled the power and communication lines of the region and there was no siren along the sea.
The Indonesian people took BMKG to social media for tsunami warnings and failing to publish information on time.
"Any unhealthy ... warning was taken ... although tsunami came... a tweeter user Janogucy told BMKG in a direct message.
Golf: 'Molliwood' jungle to break the records of the Box Office

Fleetwood has claimed the highest points in a Rider Cup by European Ruky.
Mollywood, in the first sight of the newly signed army, was the possible claimant to lead the European charge in the pair.
The first time Rider Cup winner like Fleetwood does not expect such an exhibition when Molinery was unable to win any of the six previous matches and lost four.
However, the more positive point of view was that Fleetwood was at European number one last year, knows about Lee Golf National Course by winning French Open in 2017 and showed the mood of playing a big match in the US Open this year.
Molinri is the Fresher British Open Champion and is widely considered as the most relevant bolster on European Tour - a symptom that has paid heavy dividends on the narrow path in searching the rescue, as most Americans do, was a source of disaster.
The dynasty, who was a great on-course chemistry, proved to be an inevitable force.
"I feel a little emotional and we are only Saturdays, the famous Fleetwood, who has shown the whole window game with a huge smile on his face.
We actually performed well this afternoon, actually played densely and well.
Together, it is really special to have a history.
I am just happy that we have done our work for the team.
Moliniri was also so happy.
It has been wonderful to play with Tommy, he added.
But we had come to do one thing, not to enter the record book, that 4-12 points that will be necessary for the victory of tomorrow, we have to fight hard and it will not be easy.

NIO-NAJI was used as a codeword while protecting Erdogan on Berlin visit by German cops - RT World News
A pair of police officers from Eastern Germany used the name of a well-known extremist Nio Nazi to work during the operation to protect President Erdogan of Turkey who visited Berlin this week.
Regional Inter-Ministry said that the Criminal Police Electoral Unit (CPEE) in the Eastern German State Sexons is examining two members of SEK.
During his expected visit to Germany, men were kept to protect Turkish President Recep Taipe Erdogan.
The officers needed protocols to use the codnam as undercover work.
He was selected by a well-known member of Uve Bohnhard, National Socialist Underground (NSU), a Neo-Nazi extremist group who killed eight Turkish immigrants, one Greek citizen and German police officer in the decade of 2000.
When both sides signed to access internal documents issued in the local media report, strange Kodnam came out.
The in-charge officers of the operation responded at a rapid pace and the police officers were immediately called.
Sexony personnel were the first to respond to the police's big petroleum clain.
He said that the name of BohnHardt was fortunately meant in foolishness, and demonstrates the ignorance of the victims and their relatives.
The interior minister of sexony, Roland Waller, pushed these words as abusive, horrific and completely unacceptable.
The visit of Erdogan to Berlin on Friday has witnessed a significant debate in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticised for hosting a leader who is more official.
Merkel said that the visit is very important because individual meetings are necessary to resolve the distance whenever there is a distance.
NSUs were first published in 2011 when the dead bodies of BohnHartt and his colleagues Uve Mandlos were found inside the burnt motorhouse in East Germany.
Both of them are believed to have died in the murder of an unsuccessful bank robbery in the city of ISAINEC.
Beat espene, the third and last Northern member of the Nio-Nazi Group, was stopped shortly after.
In July this year, the German Court had punished him by punishing him in 10 murders and punishing him.
He refused to participate in the murders, but his lawyer said that he believes that he is ethically guilty to fail to stop the murder.
A comprehensive vaccination of German security agencies has been made from Kaubhand around NSU.
The lawyers, workers and the relatives of the victims believe that the group had a lot of colleagues.
It has also come to light that the local intelligence agency of Germany, BFVA, had placed innumerable information providers in NSUs and systematically systematically made the systematic blood testing, attempt to blood and the looting of the group unsuccessful and impossible.
Resolution of 20 million penalties with SEC to be awarded as Chairman of Tesla
Ellon Mask has addressed the US Securities and Exchange Commission, who claimed to be on tweets for privatization of textiles.
Mask will have to resign from the post of Chairman, but will maintain the position of the CEOs.
According to Settlement Filing, Mask has 45 days to descend from the post of Textile Board of Directors and is prohibited to take charge for three years.
It will also have to pay 20 million penalties.
And because this whole thing has either started on a tweet, either with carelessness or intended carelessness, whatever to say about Masken Tesla, it has to be obtained prior permission, in some form, including posts on social media, but it is not limited enough, for example, Twitter, website of the company, press relies and investor cols.
Tesla will have to pay more than 20 million others to address the unsuccessful claims of treatment of initial tweets of mask.
The complaints of SEC had placed investors on masks in a tweet on August, which stated that it has raised funds for privatization of telegrams at a price of 420 per share, which increased the share of the company by more than 10.
Mask immediately denying his point, he said that he will keep Tesla private and highlighted the fury of investors.
The SEC pronounced the initial words of Mask that they were rolling wrongly and inappropriate because there was no ground in reality.
Mask himself claims that it was an authentic mistake, wrote in a block post that it was under the print that he had secured funds in a meeting with the representatives of Saudi Arabia's highest wealth fund.
Mask and SEC were found to be close to a lesser sentence, which had banned Mask to become a chairman for two years and they did not need to accept any offense, but Maske returned support on Thursday.
After that, on Friday, the textile share fell, looked back to his mind and accepted tough conditions.
However, like the old Soda, there is no need for a joke to accept the crimes of investors who drive newborns in a bad way.
Alexandria's pledge to support a qualitative Ukrainian church, which urges conservative unity.
Alexandria's elder Theodor II has shown support for the Unanikal Ukrainian Reform Church, which is part of Moscow.
It comes with an opportunity between Russian Rudychust church and Constantinople Petriarcate.
Thiodore arrived in the southern Ukraine city of Orissa on Thursday 2, meeting high church delegates and extremists.
Alexandria is one of the most honourable footprints of the largest orthodoxy, which is second for the equanical interaction of Constantinople.
I have come here to tell you: Stay with conscience and technological church, Petriarch Theodor II had said in his address.
After his visit to Odisha, he met the Polish Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Servants, who also supported the Canonical Ukrainian Church.
Both were also asked not to argue to stop the Ukrainian Church from giving autobiography.
Theodor II promised that we will always be with those who want conservative unity.
The Orthodox Church has recently faced a major crisis in recognition of the freedom of the Ukrainian Religious Church.
Later, Russian Orthodox is a constitutional part of the church, which is also known as Moscow Petriarcate.
Constantinople has decided to send its experiment to Kive, which effectively violates the rule, in which one orthodox church is prohibited to enter into internal matters of the second church.
Exerk Wada is a special representative who has a technically high position in the schedule of discussions in comparison to Metropolitan Onfray, which is presently the Ukrainian Review Church of Moscow Petriachart.
The Moscow responded in anger to the action of Petriarchet Constantinopal, under the leadership of representatives of Constantinopal or co-chaired church services and joint functioning of Membership in each structure.
However, this decision was called vigilance against more adverse steps for Costinopal and it does not put a complete break on inter-deliberation relations.
Ukraine hosts three routine discussions, so far, only one of them - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Petriarcate - is acknowledged by other discussions.
Most Ukrainian priests recognize its authority, but the government is openly filing one of the distinguished discussions in the court - which is the Ukrainian ritual church called u Petriarkate, which emerged in the decade of 10.
In the religious movement, there is a PitrPrime Filaret, which wants to be equal to the official position of Orthodox church, completely independent and Moscow patriotic.

Highlights of UN speech of Lavarov
At the UN, Russian Foreign Prime Minister Sergi Lauroway attacked the political blackmail and western force of the West and said that the diplomatic should not guide the headlines and unilateral restrictions.
Foreign Prime Minister Laurove told the UN General Assembly on Friday that efforts were made to maintain a self-disclosed position as global leaders, some of the Western powers have no regret in putting pressure on others.
He did not name the nations, but said that they use political blackmail, economic pressure and lasting energy.
The small groups of countries will have to pay a higher price to the world for these self-interest aspirations.
Lavarov, who was Russian messenger for the UN for a decade, told the meeting that the replacement of politics's culture and dialogue has been taken by leadership and one-party approvals without the permission of the UN.
The Minister said that such regulations that extend to dozens of countries where illegal or unemployed are obstacles to the obstacles of Juna Cuba for decades of US.
Lavarove said, but history does not teach us anything, and added that Aropo, based on the most prospective object, is sufficient for some Western counterparts to blame anyone.
We remember that these injustice claims were used to support and encourage wars, such as Bomb Dhaka of Yugoslavia, attack on Iraq in 2003 and during Libya in 2011.
The list of attacks under the Western Front was not extensive as Lavarov refers to the seven-year Syrian war as one of the latest examples.
An unsuccessful endeavour to eradicate governance in Damascus - which had been linked to the militants - would have been able to degrade the entire country and could have led to terrorism.
Lavarove appreciated the peace process that was jointly launched by Russia, Turkey and Iran, which helped prevent Islamic States (IS, earlier ISIS) and other groups from burning on Syria.
Now it is a major priority to reconstruct war-driven places in the country and help refugees return safely to their homes.
Returning to the Great Shakti Competition, Laurove said that the UN was actually made of the facts that the Bija was learnt from World War.
The Russian Foreign Prime Minister noted that 80 years of the 1938 Shameful Communication Agreement will be completed in 2018, wherein French and UK Hitler had agreed to approve Nazi connectivity of Czechoslovakia's German-Business Partnership in the ship to please.
However, British Chief Minister Naville Chamberlain claimed that the Munique Agreement meant peace for our time, a year later, the war started.
Lavarove said, Communic Confidence shows us how far the neglect of national ego and international law can go away.
The colonial era must be carried out by the supremacy and force of the colonial era or put in the waste of history.
According to the levy, Moscow believes that creative dialogue can reach any challenge that arises in global issues.
If you have any questions or claims to anyone then talk and tell the facts, listen to the teams of those against you, try to balance your interests.
Dust in the eye
What we know about Israel's vague News is in line with BB's direction to Iran - RT World News
During the address of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), the Israeli veteran was the prime minister, whether Tehran had a private atomic location.
Just as Israel plays a game of evil, let's do that they have their own radioactive bone pincher in the payakhana or why.
Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior Prime Minister of Israel, brought his new expression by his nurturing proposals, showing air photographs of Iranian sites, which includes the said atomic material.
It was not time for Tehran to respond and said that it was better to pay attention to the Atomic Weapons Programme that Tehsil-Aviv did not reveal it.
When Israel has never accepted - especially, has not refused to possess military nuclear equipment, RT's Murad Gazdive thinks that Tele Aviv is not really the right country to squeeze his fingers on others.

Bryant, who rejected the offer of the agreement with the Baltimore Revenge and is constantly associated with the Claveland Brown, used to say that he was focusing on improving himself before signing with the team.
Owens, who attended the Prof. Ball of Fame in August and still announces a return to NFL, told TMS that Bryant's attention should be returned to the field immediately.
Owens told the website that it proves to everyone in the team that it seems to be able to do the way it does.
Because every person, if you listen to all the critics, it seems that one step has been lost, it is not the person who was once there that he feels that it is.
Go to this point on sports, rosters, whether it is money, it is a year's deduction, a two-year deal, whatever you do, and show everyone you can do what you do.
Bryant, team leader, has 6 receptions 838 yards and six tuchdownes with Dallas in 2017.
A two-year-old 100-yard exhibition has gone to Karkirdi-Lamba 23 regular sports.
After signing five years of 0 million agreements in 2015, Brint has failed to record 1,000 Yard seasons or more than eight tuchdowne receptions in the season.

Owens, who had made 38 tuchdowns in three seasons with the dels, said, "I don't know whether the relationship has broken or not.
I am thinking for the day, if the Coboys welcomed him and got the opportunity, he would be comfortable for the day and the French.
