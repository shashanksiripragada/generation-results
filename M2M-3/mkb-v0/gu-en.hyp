Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is a holy festival of Diwali.
My best wishes to you all on Diwali.
It has been said in the sloka: Light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which oppositely destroys wisdom and sees goodwill.
I salute DivyaJyoti to remember this Diwali, who is better than that, to spread light, to spread positiveness and pray to end the spirit of enemies.
Nowadays, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in this but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations of the country also celebrate the festival of Diwali with full joy.
In a way, India stands there.
Friends, Festival tourism is also an attraction of itself in the world.
Festival tourism is also immensely possibilities in the festivals that our country has.
It should be our endeavour to spread such festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and to include the people of other states and other countries in the joy of festivals.
There are many different festivals of each state and every region that the people of other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country in increasing festival tourism in India is also very important.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Gai Mann Ki Baat that this Diwali would do something different.
Let us all celebrate the women power and their achievements of India, i. e.
And soon afterwards, there was an innumerable inspirational stories on social media.
He has written on the Namo App that my mother is my power.
Since the passing away of my father in the 10th century, my mother took the responsibility of our fifth daughter.
Today we are in a good business with the fifth brother.
My mother is God for me.
It is universal for me and that is the true meaning of Lakshmi of India.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swami, who lives on a tweeter, says, Major Khushbu Kanwar is India's Lakshmi, who is the daughter of a bus conductor.
Laxmi of India is his daughter for poetry tivari.
He is proud that his daughter works beautifully.
He has won a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
So Medha Jain ji has also written that a two-year-old woman has been drinking water free of cost to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Medhaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by the people.
You must read, get inspiration and share yourself if there is such an inspirational story around you.
I respectfully salute all these Laxmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 17th century.
How beautiful words, how good feelings and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada.
Peninda Permegondanu Himavantunu, Peninda Bhrigu Perchidanupeninda Jankarayun Jasvadenu Arthat, Himavant i. e.
Our daughters are our pride and our society has a strong identity and a bright future due to the greatness of these dairies.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day when the 550th light festival of Shri Gurunanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
Guru Nanak ji's influence is not only in India but in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are in some countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never forget my visit to the Gurudwaras in Vancover and Tahiran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanakdev Ji that I can tell you, but for that many people need Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanakdev ji delivered his message to far and wide in the world.
He was one of the most travellers in his time.
He went to several places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone with his ease, humility and simplicity.
With the message of goodwill and equality, they went to the north, south, east, west, every direction, everywhere people met saints and sages.
It is believed that the well-known Saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
A sacred place in Kashi is Gurubagh Gurudwara .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji was staying there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
In the south, Guru Nanakdev ji travelled to Sri Lanka.
During the visit of Bidra to Karnataka, Guru Nanakdev himself had solved the water problem there.
Gurunanak Jira Saheb is a famous place in Bidra which also reminds us of Gurunanak Devji.
During a sad moment, Gurunanak Dev Ji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
This led to a very close relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where the people considered him a Guru.
He is also revered in Uzbekistan where he had travelled.
He got a place in the hearts of lakhs of people who followed their teachings with full faith and are still doing it today.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassadors of about 85 countries visited Amritsar from Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this became the 550th Prakash Parva of Gurunanak Devji.
Thereafter, many ambassadors had put their pictures on social media and had described their good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you will definitely remember the day of 31st October.
This day is the birth anniversary of Indias iron man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was a great hero to celebrate the country in the form of unity.
While Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to coordinate with those who had ideological differences.
He was really a man of details.
He was also an expert in organisation skills.
He was involved in formulation and strategy.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, we listen to him, we know how much his organisation was.
In 121, thousands of delegates from all over the country were scheduled to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad.
The entire system of the session was responsible for Sardar Patel. He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
And ensured that nobody suffers from water.
Not only this, he also took care of the fact that no representative's luggage or footprint should be stolen at the place of the session and it would be very pleasant to know what Sardar Patel did.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags.
On the other hand, the sale of fertilizer has also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big Bhagirath and historic work to unite the Rajwadas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai also had a special feature, whose eyes were on every event.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on the far-reaching Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in integration of the country is also discussed in some specific regions.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbours looked at Lakshadweep and sent the ship with their flag.
It was ascertained as Sardar Patel that he immediately started strict action without wasting time, without delay.
Immediately after his order, the tricolor was hoisted and demolished every neighbour of the neighbourhood to occupy Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told Mudaliar brothers that they should ensure that they get the necessary help for the development of Lakshadweep individually.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist spot.
I hope all of you will visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, on the day of 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the country and to the world.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in the United States has doubled the height.
The world's tallest statue fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian gets higher.
You will be happy to know that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists had come to visit the Statue of Unity.
This means that every day about eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can become a subject of study for the tourism industry for the country and for all the states.
We all witness how a place develops as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
People from all over the country come there.
Good arrangements for transportation, accommodation, guide, environment friendly systems are developing on their own.
A big economy is developing and people are providing facilities according to the needs of the tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, There will be some Indian who is not proud of the fact that in the past, the Time Magazy has also given an important place to the Statue of Unity among the 100 important tourist spots of the world.
I hope that all of you will be able to see the Statue of Unity by taking some time out of your precious time.
This is my request.
Friends, You know that from 2014 every year the National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October.
This day gives us the message of protecting our country's unity, integrity and security.
Like every time, Ekta Run-Run for Unity is also being organized on 31st October.
This will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting to see a grief and publicity for marathon.
Run for Unity has also been a unique event.
Running is beneficial for all minds, brains and body.
The spirit of fit India is reflected by running here.
At the same time, we are associated with the objective of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not just the body, but the mind and culture connect India to new heights for the unity of India.
And that is why you can connect with the city wherever you live.
I hope that all of you will run on October 31, for India's unity and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel bound the country with unity.
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversities like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage on every turn at every level.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us, there will be many examples that have been continuously working to enhance harmony.
But sometimes it becomes such that the contribution of the society becomes very soon disappearing from the memorial.
Friends, I remember that when the Allahabad High Court had heard its revelations about Ramjanmabhoomi in September 2010.
Just remember those days how the atmosphere was there.
The groups of their own interests were playing games to take advantage of this situation in their own way.
What kind of language was being spoken to produce heat in the atmosphere.
He was also trying to fill the tikash in different voices.
Efforts were made to reduce the tension from the environment.
We must always remember that it gives us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a duty bond for all of us.
This is the example of the voice of unity that can give the country a great strength.
Today, I pay homage to him too.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things so I think I have heard you too.
You imagine that the world's highest battlefield or where the temperature goes to 50-60 degrees minus from zero.
Oxygen is also the only name in the air.
It is not less than any paradigm to be in the face of such challenges.
In such a calamity, our brave soldiers are taking out their chest and protecting the borders of the country but they are also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the people of the country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to decompose waste.
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is a very important task in itself.
We all know that Siachen is a snow laden area which is a source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, Swachhta Abhiyan is meant to ensure clean water for the people living in the neighbouring areas, these people also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival to awaken a new consciousness in the lives of all of us.
And especially in Diwali, buying something or the other, bringing something from the market and making it in a minimum quantity in every family.
Once I had said that we should coincide to buy local things.
There is no need to go to Taluka if we get the requirements from our village.
There is no need to go to the district if found in Taluka.
We will try to buy more local things.
The centenary of Gandhi will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that we should buy something or the other made by our khadi workers made by our weavers brothers and sisters.
This Diwali too would have bought a lot of money before Diwali.
But there will be many people who think that if I go after Diwali then perhaps they will be able to get a little cheaper.
So there will be many people who will still be buying.
So along with the best wishes of Diwali, I would like to urge you to buy local things and buy local things.
Look, how important we can play in realizing the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I extend my best wishes to you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We have species of species in Diwali.
But sometimes there is a fire in unconsciousness.
There is also some wound.
I urge you all to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately, there will be an Indian who is not proud of our armed forces and our army personnel.
Every Indian, whether it is any region, caste, religion, creed or language - is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the Surgical Strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the proxy war in the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our Armed Forces organized exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can know what our strengths are, how capable we are and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by keeping their lives in danger.
A day like Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armed forces.
And inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and now it is certain that our soldiers will answer all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and prosperity in our country.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but by compromising with respect and not at the cost of sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice towards peace in two world wars and that was when we had no connection with that war.
Our eyes never looked at another land.
It was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on 23rd September, we recalled our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lensers who had liberated Haifa from the invasions on the completion of 100 years of the Haifa war in Israel.
It was also a valour made by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the most soldiers sent to the United Nations in different peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
One of the participants of the parade that people wait for during the Republic Day celebrations is the fly past, in which our Air Force showcases its strength with the strange cars.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
Our Air Force has joined the 21st century's most adventurous and powerful Air Force today, moving ahead from a small start with 6 pilots and 17 air soldiers in 132.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistani attackers started an unprecedented attack, the Air Force had ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reached the battlefield on time to save Srinagar from the terrorists.
The Air Force also responded to the enemies in 1965.
Who does not know the fight for Bangladesh's independence in 1917
The Air Force has also played an important role in making Kargil free from the possession of bribery in 1977.
By bombing the enemies in Tiger Hill, the air force smoked them dust.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful to them for the commendable work of our air warriors.
Their morale has been amazing to tackle natural calamities from storms, storms, floods to forest fires and to help the countrymen.
Air Force has set an example in ensuring equality of gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of each of its departments for the daughters of the country.
Now, along with the Short Service Commission, the Air Force is also giving the option of the Permanent Commission, which I had announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that not only male power but also female power is contributing to the Armed Forces in India.
Women are not only empowered but now they are also becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, Abhilash Tomy, an officer of the Navy, was fighting for his life and death.
The whole country was worried how to save Tommy.
You know that Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he was moving forward with his pace in the ocean to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean but created a terrible ocean artillery for him but this hero of the Indian Navy continued to gather between the sea for several days.
I had met Tommy before.
Even after coming out of such a calamity, he had a strong mindset and once again the pledge to do something that he told me is inspired for the youth of the country.
I pray for Abhilash Tommy's best health and his courage, his valour, his determination, his strength to win and win will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child knows what is the importance of our nation on 2nd October.
October 2 this year has a special significance.
For two years from today, we will have several programmes across the world to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Whether it is Martin Luther King Junior or great dignitaries like Nelson Mandela, they could fight for a long time to gain strength from Gandhiji's thoughts and to give their people the right to equality and respect.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss with you another important task of revered Bapu, which the countrymen should know more and more.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later, in 1945, when the freedom struggle gained momentum, he prepared a revised copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu has put his ideas in front of the countrymen on several subjects like the protection of farmers, villages, the rights of workers, cleanliness and spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a public collector.
It was Bapu's specialty to connect with the people and to connect them with them, it was in his nature.
This is the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every individual feel that it is the most important and eternal need for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
At the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, every section of the society, every section of the society dedicated themselves.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhiji's Talisman.
In this, Gandhiji had said, I would like to give you a message. Whenever you are suspected that if you start roaming on you here then try this cottage, remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how useful the steps you are thinking to fill
Will it benefit him
Can he control his own life and luck
That is, will it give crores of people who are hungry and the soul is unsatisfactory
Then you will see that your suspicion is recovering and ending here.
My dear countrymen, a gate of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country, its growing economic strength, the growing purchasing power, can we remember the revered Bapu for a moment
Can we remember that gem of revered Bapu
Who would be fortunate that will benefit from your purchase directly or straightforward
And if the poorest of the poor benefits, then my happiness will be more and more.
Whenever we commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji whenever we buy something in the coming days, we must imagine that every countrymen of our shopping will have some or the other countrymen and those who have sweated their sweat, those who have dedicated their talent should benefit somebody or the other.
This is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that the poorest and the weakest person can bring a big result in his life.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if we clean up then we will get freedom, they might not know how it will happen, but it happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, today we can also feel that this small task of my country can contribute to the strength of economic empowerment and the poor to fight against poverty. And I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era, this is the work of revered Bapu.
For example, if you think of buying khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to preserve the old or broken clothes of Khadi because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He used to say that all these khadi clothes are made with utmost hard work - one of their tenants should be used.
This feeling of affection for the country and love for the people of the country was settled in the rug of that great man.
Two days later, along with revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji.
As soon as the name of Shastriji comes, we feel immense devotion to the people of India.
His compassionate personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had a special feature that he looked very humble from outside but from inside he was determined as a mountain.
His formula of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is the identity of his vast personality.
His selfless penance towards the nation was the result of that in a brief period of one and a half years, he gave the mantras to bring the country's soldiers and farmers to the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today when we are reminding of revered Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot stay without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called 'Swachhta Hi Seva' started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I was also fortunate to donate sanitation work with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by the revered Babasaheb.
People from all walks across the country joined this Shramdan on 15th.
Institutions also contributed to it by Rangechang.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS (NSS), youth organizations, media groups, corporate world, all have donated sanitation at a large scale.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers.
Let's hear a phone call-namaskar
You have said a big thing. Swachhta has its own importance in everybody's life and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, toilets have been built in your house and it is now facilitating you.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign do not even imagine that you cannot see because of being a practitioner, but when you do not have toilets, you will have to spend your lives with so many difficulties and how big it has become a boon for you after making toilets.
Perhaps you didn't have a phone call to talk about this aspect, perhaps it would not have been a sensitive aspect in the attention of the people associated with this mission of cleanliness.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world.
This time India is organizing the world's largest cleanliness conference in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) is showcasing its experiments and experiences related to sanitation among the sanitation ministers and experts from all over the world.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu.
It is particularly essential to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, oppressed and deprived.
Dr.
In the Constitution passed by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the basic rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 13th.
A few days later, the NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also worked to enhance human dignity.
Our favourite leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had clearly said that human rights are not a partial concept for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal source of Vedic era is engraved.
NHRC has created widespread awareness for human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing misuse of human rights.
In this 25-year journey, it has created an atmosphere of hope and faith among the people of the country.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and behaviour that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan or be it the birth centenary of Rajmata Vijayaraj Scindia ji - all these great men are inspiring us all, we salute them and on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb.
This year too, we will try to organise 'Run for Unity' in our village, in the city, in the city and in the metropolis.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge you all to strengthen our efforts to bind every section of the society, every unit of the country through the run for unity on 31st October and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been a big example of social harmony.
There are many stories in the history of the country in which one guard had linked two different royal or religious people with faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire atmosphere will rise to elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanayya Lal Ki, Govinda Gobind.
The natural joy of swinging in the color of Lord Krishna is very different.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to daughter Chinmayi who raised this subject.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are engaged in preserving this great heritage, nutrition and delivering it to the people.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud of the fact that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And all of us are proud of the fact that from Vedas to present, Sanskrit language has also played a major role in the spread of knowledge.
The repository of knowledge associated with every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for dialogue.
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are possible.
The creation of numerous words is possible by 2000 metals, 200 per cent i. e.
And that's why, in any subtle sense, the subject can be surely expressed.
That is, if a Guru gives knowledge of one letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole world so that the disciple can take off that loan of his Guru.
We all celebrate this Teachers Day with this feeling. Knowledge and Guru are invaluable, invaluable and invaluable.
I wish all the teachers of the country the next Teachers Day.
I thank you for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, these hardworking people bring new hopes for our farmers.
Monsoon provides relief to dry trees and dry reservoirs in the bright sunlight.
But sometimes it brings overwhelming and devastating floods.
There has been a situation of nature that some places have received more rainfall than other places.
Recently, all of us have seen that Kerala has had a great impact on the life of the people.
Today, in this difficult situation, the whole country stands with Kerala.
Our sympathy is with those families.
I am confident that Kerala will soon be resumed with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
But we also see humanity during disasters.
Wherever disasters have occurred, whether it is Kerala or any other district of India or region, people are doing something in place of their own in place of life from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.
All the adults and people associated with every field of work are contributing to their contribution.
We all know that the Armed Forces are dry about the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala.
He left no stone unturned to save the people trapped in the flood.
Whether it is the Air Force, the Navy, the ground, the BSF, the CISF, the RF, everyone has played a very important role in rescue and relief operations.
I would also like to mention the hard work of the brave soldiers of the NDRF.
The topic that people from all over the country have written is the subject, the beloved of all of us, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Akhil Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, who knows that many innumerable people have written on Narendra Modi Mobile App and on MyGov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the day of August 16, the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise, Harkoi was mourned.
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone far away from active politics.
The kind of affection, devotion and grief that has emerged for Atal ji showcases his vast personality.
For the last several days, the best aspect of Atal ji has come before the country.
India will always be borrowed by Atalji for the 17th Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has resulted in two significant changes in India's politics.
Firstly, the term of the Cabinet in the States has been limited to 15 of the Full Assembly meetings.
Secondly, the limit specified under the Anti-Palties Act has been increased from one third to two thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been decided to disqualify the parties with their support.
The political culture of making big cabinets in India for several years was built not only for sharing of work but for enjoying political leaders.
Atal ji changed this culture.
Their steps saved money and resources.
Its collaborative efficiency has also increased.
Atal ji was the visionary one who changed the situation and implemented a healthy tradition in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 PM.
In this way, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the people.
I would certainly say that for a healthy democracy, for a better democracy, for a good tradition, for a strong democracy, for a strong effort, for a strong and open minded discussion, it will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Just a few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament has been completed.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 4.
And as a result, the Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and 14 Bills in this session.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of the youth.
In this session, several important bills that benefit the youth and the backward classes were passed.
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for the formation of OBC Commission just like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of forming OBC Commission this time.
The work of passing the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has also been done in this session.
The Act will further protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Together, he will prevent criminals from committing atrocities on the people of this class and irrigate faith in the Dalit community.
No member society can tolerate any injustice against the country's women power.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has punished such criminals with rigorous punishment and will be punished for at least 10 years.
While those who sacrificed children below 12 years of age will be punished for hanging.
Just a few days ago, I would have read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh had to punish two criminals of Kukarma on a sagri after completing the golden sword in just two months.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had punished criminals after just five days of hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have given such a rapid payment.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing the cases of crime against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the fourteenth session, everyone has presented an ideal.
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of countrymen is now on Asian Games playing in Jakarta.
On waking up every morning, people first look at newspapers, television, news and social media and see that a Indian sportsperson has won a medal.
Asian Games are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to the sportspersons who are still left.
Indias sportspersons, especially in marks and wrestling, are showing excellent performance, but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in such sports as we have not been able to see before.
This is not just medal, but it is proven that the sky of Indian sports and sportspersons is a joke and dream.
Our girls in the increasing number of medal winners for the country are a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who have won medals, our growing youngsters of the age of 15-16 years are also.
It is also a very good indication that most of the medal winners live in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success with hard work.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay my homage to the great sportsperson of Hockey Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all the citizens of the country to take care of sports and fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then India will build a bright future.
Namaste Bhavnaji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen buildings and houses with brick stones but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago a huge mountain, which was a whole rock, was given the form of an excellent large and amazing temple, perhaps it is difficult to imagine but it was made.
And that is the temple - the Kailashnath Temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra. If someone tells you that a pillar of granite was built about 60 metres long about a thousand years ago, and a laying stone of about 80 tonnes of granite was laid on its top.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable mixture of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Harkoi is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna, Gujarat.
India's land engineering laboratory has been there.
There have been several engineers in India who have made imaginable and have presented a miracle in the world of engineering.
In our legacy of great engineers, we have also received such a ritual whose works are still surprising people.
M.
In that part of the country, they are revered, but the rest of the country also remembers them with great respect and spirit.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following their footprints, the engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world.
When I talk about the miracles in the world of engineering, I remember a terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother-in-law of more than 100 years.
They were joking at me and saying, Look, this is my house.
It is called Bhungo in Kutch.
I have seen 3-3 earthquakes in my house later.
But you will not find any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the natural condition of this place.
And I was proud to say that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created a local situation, due to which the common man lived safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
What new things will we have to learn in the changing age
You have to learn
Will you have to connect
What should be taught to the students
How to make ero West our priority
We must think of many such things when we celebrate Engineers Day.
My dear countrymen, is the atmosphere of festivals.
And at the same time, the preparations for Diwali also start.
With this emotion, my best wishes to all.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
So, people are still waiting for rain at some places.
India's vastness and diversity sometimes shows the form of rain as a dislike.
But what do we blame the rain
Man is the one who chose the path of struggle with nature and consequently, sometimes nature is angry with us.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day, Kismath was allowed something else.
When he went away from the cave, suddenly due to heavy rains, a good water was collected near the entrance of the cave.
The way out of them was closed.
Because of no road, all of them stopped inside the cave on a small plain.
And that too is not a two-day, for 18 days.
On one hand, they were facing a crisis.
On the other hand, humanity in the whole world was demonstrating the human values that God had saved.
People all over the world were praying for these children to get out of safety.
The feeling of responsibility at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government or the parents of these children or their family members, be it media or be it the citizens of the country, everybody has shown them a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
All of them were associated with their mission as a team.
I believe that the restraint of everybody's behavior is a matter of learning and understanding.
It is not that parents should not be unhappy, it is not that tears have not grown from the eyes of mothers, but patience, restraint and peaceful behavior of the entire society is a matter of learning for all of us.
It shows that when humanity becomes a wealth, it becomes a wonderful thing.
A few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, had taken away from us.
We can also inspire and inspire the Indians about every thing of Neerajji.
Our school board gave us the exam at the time of exams, we talked about the stress and tension of the examination and now your show is a message for students like me.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and all the youngsters.
Because this is the time when the college is very busy.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school and enter college.
If you go to the Feb and March examinations, papers and northerns, then in the months of April and May, the results are spent in enjoying the holidays as well as enjoying the way forward in life, selecting the conviction etc.
The attention of the students is limited to the school by removing from home.
Students come under the umbrella of professors from the umbrella of parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, going out of the house, leaving the village and getting out of a protective environment, one has to become a partner of oneself.
All these youngsters have left their homes for the first time and have left their lives in a new direction.
I would like to tell you all that be calm, believe in life and enjoy inner joy in life.
Learn something new, like new skills, learn new languages.
He has already succeeded in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
His father enrichs his family with waste.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come from the poor families and despite the opposite constraints, they have done something that inspires us all.
Then he is the Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father has a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta in Kolkata, who studied on footpath by sitting below the streetlight, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afreen Sheikh, whose father runs autorickshaw.
Or, the Divyang daughter of Gudgaon is Anushka Panda who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spine muscular atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved the success of seeing the whole world by dissolving every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us, we will also get some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives energy to my mind and inspires me.
And when I am telling you the story of these youngsters, I remember the words of poet Neeraj Ji and this is the goal of life.
Something that happened was that once I was discussing with two Indian youths in San Jose city of America, known as the technology hub.
I appealed to him how he can use his talent for India, he should think and take time out and do something.
He urged them to convert the brain drain into a brain gain.
Both of them from Rae Bareli, IT professionals, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Bajpayee, have made an innovative endeavour by resolving my challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a smart village app by using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village with the whole world but now they ask for any information that they can get information on their mobile.
These residents of Taudhakpur village of Rae Bareli, Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Taluka Development Officer, all made people aware about the use of this app.
It has now become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works being done in the village.
The app includes the phone directory of the village, the Information Department, the list of events, health centres and monthly centres.
The grammar feature of the app, the faculty rate between the farmers, works as a market for their products in a way.
If you look at this event minutely then one thing will be noticed that those people who have lost their lives in the United States in the midst of living and conduct, those youngsters who have left India several years ago also know the nuances of their villages, understand the challenges and are associated with the feelings of the village.
This is the reason why perhaps they can make the village well what they want and they can make it better according to it.
Every Indian has a feeling of feeling of doing something for its own village, its original engagement and devotion.
But sometimes due to a distance due to time, sometimes due to conditions, a thin dust gets accumulated on it, but if a small squirrel gets touched then the good thing emerges again.
Pandharpur Vari is a unique journey in itself.
Friends, Ashadi Ekadshi, which was celebrated on 23rd July this time, is celebrated as a magnificent festival of Pandharpur Vari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Almost 15-20 days before the Ashadi Akadashi, the pilgrims of Varkari i. e.
This journey, which is called Vari, adds lakhs of workers.
Pudukas of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were kept in palanquin, Vithal.
Tirthankaras Bhagwan Vithal, which is also called Vithoba or Pandurang.
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
There is a different experience of visiting the Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and the monument there, its beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Vari once you get the opportunity.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still educating others in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against superstition.
We get the message of harmony, love and brotherhood from them, whether it is their burden or impression.
There is a mantra of fighting society against superstition.
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokyo and mirrors and ensured that the old families should be eliminated from our society and irrigated the cultures of compassion, equality and purity among the people.
We remember Tilak ji on 23rd July and his death anniversary on first August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
They had the power and intellect to show the glimpse of their mistakes to the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he had tried to put treason on them three times in 20 years and this is not a small thing.
Today, I would like to put an interesting incident related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad in front of the countrymen.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, perhaps 100 years ago.
During this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel got the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 120, he decided that he would build Tilak jis memorial in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28 February 12.
And I am listening to that time of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of public Ganesh Festival started.
The Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of traditional faith and empathy as well as social awareness, collectivity, harmony and equality among the people.
Likewise, it was a time when the country had a wealth for the fight against the British, these festivals broke the sects of caste and sect and worked to make everyone one wealth.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
This shows how this is a craze in our younger generation towards our ancient heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities you can see the pavilion of Ganesha in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, I had also requested during the last time and today when I remember Lokmanya Tilak Ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate the festival of Ganesh, celebrate the festival with humility, celebrate it with full force, but urge you to celebrate the Eco Friendly Ganesh Festival.
And I would even say that the items of eco-friendly Ganesh Festival should be placed on Mai Gov and on Narendra Modi app for extensive publicity.
I will surely bring you to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak raised his confidence in the people of the country and gave a quote, Swaraj is our right to be born, and we will take it and it is still a time to say that.
Swaraj is our right to be born and we will compete with it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar Azad's bravery and his people for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad put his life on the ship but he never bowed before foreign rule.
I am fortunate that I also got the opportunity to visit the village of Alirajpur in Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I salute these two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak Ji and Chandrashekhar Azad Ji.
Just a few days ago, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Dass won the Golden Moon in the 400m race at the junior under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland.
I have e-mailed from Indonesia in response to my letter to fear of one more daughter unity of the country that she is now preparing for Asian Games there.
The country has been named as Roshan.
Unity won gold and bronze medals at World Para Athletics Grand Pre 2018 in Tunisia.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenge a medium of action.
In 2003, due to road accidents, half of the lower part of the body of Dairy Ekta Bhayan has become negligible but this daughter has achieved this achievement by not losing courage and strengthening herself.
Another Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has also won a golden medal in Para Athletics Grand Pre Main Discos Thro in Berlin and Sunder Singh Gujjar, along with him, has also won a golden medal in Bhalafenk.
My dear countrymen, the month of August remains filled with a lot of events and festivals in history, but sometimes due to monsoon, diseases also enter the house.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for several centuries of celebrations.
Once again, I will definitely get Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have understood a lot that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was the first international match of Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for the Indians that this historical match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams had performed very well in this match and other boler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan had also performed very well in IPL this year and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me and wrote on his tweet that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have completed a platform to showcase our sportspersons their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
It is the world's estate of cricket and along with it he also wrote in a funny manner that we will give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world.
He did what a winner team can do while trophying the Indian team.
While taking trophy, the Indian team from Afghanistan, who was playing international matches for the first time, invited the Afghanistan team and photographed with the two teams.
What is the sportsman spirit, what is the sportsmanship - we can experience this by one event.
Sports is a very good solution to unite society and to find out the talent in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan teams.
I hope that we will play with each other, with the whole sportsman spirit as well.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, on the fourth Yoga Day, there was a different view.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Japanese Navy's warships, people were seen doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, Yoga was a historic programme and I was told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
On the high Berfila peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly practiced yoga.
Yoga works to break and connect all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people of hundreds of countries have made this opportunity a big festival by going above all kinds of discrimination, caste, religion, region, color or gender.
If people from all over the world were so enthusiastic and participating in the Yoga Day programmes, why would it not be multiplied in India
The country is proud when 125 crore people see that the security forces of our country have practiced yoga at all three places of Navy, Army and Air Force.
Some brave soldiers did yoga somewhere in Sabarina, some soldiers practiced yoga on snowy mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force surprised everyone by making yogasanas at a height of 15,000 feet from the sky.
The view was that he did not sit in the plane but swimming in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or fields of sports, Yoga has been done everywhere.
A sight of Ahmedabad was touching the heart.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have established a world record by practicing Yoga together at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
I hope that the movement of Yoga to Wellness will move forward.
More and more people will make it a part of their lives.
On My Gov and Narendra Modi App, many people have written to me that this time I talk about Doctors Day in Mann Ki Baat on 1st July.
We remember the doctor in times of difficulty but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them for their service and dedication to the society.
We are those people who worship Mother Swabhat: God, believe equal to God because Mother gives us life.
Mother gives us birth, and sometimes doctors give us birth again.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only.
Today, doctors have medical experiments and they will have general lifestyle trends, and they have a lot of immense feeling about the impact they have on our health.
Indian doctors have identified themselves all over the world with their capabilities and skills.
In medical profession, Maharath, hardworking is also known for resolving our doctors complex medical problems.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on behalf of every citizen of the country on 1st July.
My dear countrymen, we are fortunate people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which no historical event has occurred.
See, everywhere in India has its own heritage.
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everybody has his own contribution, he has his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, Kabirvad of Gujarat would be aware of you.
When I used to work there, I had done a big national session of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabir Das ji had come to Magahar
At that time there was a belief that the one who died in Maghar does not go to heaven.
The body that smells from it goes to heaven in Kashi.
Magahar was considered absurd but Saint Kabir Das did not believe in it.
He worked to break such evils and superstitions of his time and therefore he went to Magahar and grave there.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his colleagues and Doha.
He was his ideal.
We see these ideals in their compositions and in today's era it is the same inspiration.
One of his dohas is: - Kabir Soi Peer Hai, if he does not know Peer on Peerjo, So Ka Peer I mean that the true Peer Saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of the other, who does not know the pain of the other, he is indefinite.
Kabir Das ji stressed on social harmony.
He thought far beyond his time.
At that time when there was a time of struggle and struggle in the world, he gave a message of peace and harmony and worked together to remove the differences of opinion.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the welfare of the society.
A system of kitchen free from social discrimination where a person of every caste, sect, religion or sect can come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev had started this anchor system.
In 2017, the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated.
I want all of us to join it with enthusiasm and zeal.
I also urge you people to think about what new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and innovative imaginations, on the 550 Maa Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji, and with great pride we all make it an inspirational festival.
The struggle for Indias independence is very long, is very comprehensive, is full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
In 2017, the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh is also being completed 100 years, which has put humanity in shame.
Who can forget the black day of 13th April, 1919 when pills were carried out on innocent, unarmed and unarmed people crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
Vijay is always a peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice.
Shri Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyama Prasad is the birth anniversary of Mukherjee and he wants Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
First of all, I thank you.
It was very good to see your interest in India's history.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several sectors but the areas which were closest to him were education, administrative and parliamentary affairs.
Very few people would know that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed Convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense he had laid the foundation stone for India and industrial development, prepared a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of Independent India in 1948 brought the mark of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee's dream was that India should be self-sufficient, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big enterprises as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi Village Industries Board was established between 148 and 150 for providing financial and organisation setups to them for the better development of Kutir and small industries.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Their understanding, understanding and activeness is the result of a part of Bengal to be saved and it is part of India today.
Dr.
Recall the message of the unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the spirit of harmony and brotherhood should be associated with India's progress.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
We got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people by moving ahead of the files.
People spoke of their resolutions, their happiness and grief, their achievements.
Daughters in remote villages are providing services from the pension of the elderly to making passports through Common Service Centre.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh mixed a ice cream and used to do business.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras as well as providing affordable medicines to nearby villages.
There were no corners of the country where people had not spoken of their success.
In such a environment, when a common man comes with a new hope, new zeal and the events that have occurred in his life, he does not have the credit of the government.
The incident of a small child in a remote village also becomes an inspiration for the 125 crore Indians.
With the help of technology, through video bridge, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries has been very pleasant, very inspiring and it gives me satisfaction to work but also encouraging to do more.
There is a new joy, a new enthusiasm, a new inspiration to give life to the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the people of the country.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined this video bridge and you have worked to give me a new strength.
Once again I would like to express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere or the other is good.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing came in my mind and it is a unique combination.
On the one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture are working in the fields.
Now you would be wondering that this is two different businesses - what is the relationship with it
However, it is such that in Bangalore, corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together to form a simple prosperity trust and they have taken this trust to double the income of the farmers.
They went to connect with the farmers and started making schemes and continued to make successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through a trust.
Farmers producing cereals are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing, on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure the participation of farmers in profits.
I express my gratitude to these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technocrats and engineering have come out of their boundaries, connecting the farmers with their villages, connecting the fields.
Once again, I may have known these innovative experiments of my country to the younger generation, I may have known something, some people would have known it, some would have known it, some would not have known it, but crores of people are continuously doing something or the other.
GST will complete one year.
The dream of one nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country, it has become a reality today.
For one nation, One Tax Reform, if I have to credit the highest number of people then I will credit the states.
GST is a very good example of cooperative federalism, where all the states together took decisions in the country and then such a big tax reform was implemented in the country.
So far, two meetings of GST Council have been held and we can all be proud that people of different political ideologies sit there, people of different states sit there, there are different priority-ridden states, but the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken with all the consensus.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being implemented across the country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty.
Earlier in the country several times there were complaints of Inspector Raj in tax matters.
With the arrival of GST, the check post has stopped and the movement of goods has accelerated, which not only saves time but also benefits the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform.
Such a big tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST was ensured by the people's power.
Normally it is believed that such a big report, such a large country, such a large number of people takes 5 to 5 years to stabilize it, but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the contribution of the people's honesty is the result of the participation of the people's power that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it has also improved through its inbuilt system according to the requirement.
It has dedicated a huge success in itself by the 125 crore Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for Mann Ki Baat to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
Once again I got the opportunity to be present before you through Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered well that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama ji, I would like to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team, travelling around the world through the sea for more than fourteen days, have returned to India on 21st May and welcomed them very warmly.
He travelled through various oceans, and many seas, almost twenty thousand nautical miles away.
This was the first such event in the world.
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
If we want the development journey of humanity, then progress has arisen from some or the other adventure.
In the past, you must have seen that some innovative things have been taken into account about Mount Everest climbers and for centuries Everest has been fighting humanity and the brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak of the world in five tribal children - Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Kammode, Vikas Soyam from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur school, to these small friends.
Recently, the 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to serve Everest from Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter, Dia Everest, became the pair of the first Indian father-son.
It is not that only youngsters are climbing Everest.
Sangeeta Bahl has climbed the 1st May, and Sangeeta Bahl's age is more than 50.
There are some people who climb the Everest who showed that they have not only skills but are also sensitive.
For years people have been climbing Everest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these adventurers, especially to the daughters.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, just two months ago when I talked about Fit India, I did not think that there would be such a good impression on it.
Such a large number of people from every sector will come forward in its support.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the more we will play, the more we will play.
On social media, people are sharing video of fitness challenges, tagging each other and challenging them.
Today, everybody is joining this mission of Fit India.
Be it the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world, the common people of the country, the soldiers of the army, the teachers of the school, the same echo is heard all around - 'Hum Fit to India Fit'.
It is a matter of happiness for me that I too have been challenged by the Indian Cricket Team captain Virat Kohli and I have accepted that challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and such a challenge will encourage us to keep fit and fit for others.
Chhavi Yadav Ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of every child's life are getting lost today.
These sports were particularly a part of summer vacation.
There are two types of games in traditional sports.
It is also outside the house and is also inside the house.
The unity hidden behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same sports is known by different names.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a game in Gujarat.
It plays with the square board of the dogs or the seeds or passes of the umbrella and 88.
This game was played in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Which of us will be such that has not played Moi Dandia in childhood
Moi Dandia (Gilli Danda) is a game playing from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
It is called Gulibari in Orissa and it is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some sports had their own season.
Like kite chewing is also a season.
When all kites fly, we can express the unique qualities that we play when we play.
You must have seen that many children are of shameful nature but they become very busy while playing.
The elders who express themselves, those who look serious, one child who is hidden in them while sports comes out.
Traditional sports have become somewhat in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our logical thinking, concentration, awareness and zeal is also enhanced.
From children to grandfathers, grandfathers and grandfathers, when everybody plays, the pella which is said to be a gap or a generation gap, it goes away somewhere.
Many sports also awaken us about society, environment etc.
Today, it is necessary that schools, shares, youth groups etc. should come forward and promote these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can make a huge collection of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, on the next 5th June, our country will be officially hosting the World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and India's growing leadership in the world is also being approved in the direction of reducing climate change.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
My appeal to all of you is to ensure that we do not use polythene, law grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website Wed-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given there in a very interesting manner - see, know and try to bring them into your daily life.
When there is terrible heat, floods, rains do not take the name of stopping, unbearable cold, then every person becomes an expert and speaks of global warming, climate change but what work is done by talking about
In the last few weeks, all of us have seen that in different areas of the country, there was dust-style and heavy winds along with rains which were very low.
The loss of lives and loss of lives was also done.
All these things are basically the result of the change in the climate shape.
Our culture, our tradition did not teach us to struggle with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature and to live in harmony with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had admired this thing in his lifetime.
When India played a key role in the cop21 and the Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was a spirit of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi at the roots of all.
On this environment day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
We can aim at breaking tree plantation this time and not only planting trees but also maintaining them till they grow up.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember the 21st June, not only you, but also the entire world remembers 21st June.
June 21 is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been approved and people start preparations months ago.
Nowadays, the news is getting that strong preparations are going on in the world to celebrate June 21 as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga for Unity and Hermonius Society is a message that the world has experienced again and again in the last few years.
Yoga leads to adventure that protects us like a father forever.
A feeling of forgiveness arises as Mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bharatuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, our children, our sisters, our brothers, ourselves, our beds and knowledge becomes our hunger-free.
When all these qualities become friends of someone, the Yogi wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge the countrymen to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation ahead of our heritage of Yoga.
Today, May 2 is the death anniversary of Indias first veteran Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
This memories of the month of May are also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were committed against injustice showing their bravery.
The sad thing is that for a long time, we have been calling the incidents of 185 only revolt or revolt.
In fact, this incident was neglected, but it was also an attempt to push our self-respect.
He was Veer Savarkar, who had written with fearlessness that whatever happened in 1855 was not a rebellion but was the first fight for independence.
The heroes of India House in London, including Savarkar, celebrated its 50th anniversary with fervor.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month when the freedom struggle started before independence.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of features
He was a devotee of both weapons and sciences.
Generally Veer Savarkar is known for his struggle against his bravery and British rule, but in addition, he was also a poet and social reformer who always stressed upon harmony and unity.
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had depicted so many suits.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together.
Along with being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary.
Our daughters, who were forced to sell waste to seek households today, are learning the work of sewing and clothing to cover the body of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and faith, for their bright future.
He has shown that if you have the desire to do something and you are determined to do it, then success can be achieved in all the difficulties.
And that is not just a matter of singer but you will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at the neighbourhood then it will be noticed that how people solve problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, we also have discussions and discussions with some people present here.
These discussions are also of politics, there are social, artistic, sports and sportspersons, there are also problems of the country or there are such problems that they should be solved in such a way. But most of these things are confined to discussions only but some people are those who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes in their work, their hard work and engagement.
Shri D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
And today you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling up the light of education.
He opened a school called Asha Ashwasan for children living in slums, which costs 50 of their income from these poor tea sellers.
He provides complete education, health and food to all the children who come to school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, for his love and for giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
He has removed the darkness of his life.
Who does not know the Vedic scripture "Tamso Maa Jyotirgamaya" but has shown it alive.
Light Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
You will also have a series of inspirational events around you.
There will be countless events.
Let us move forward positively.
There is so much heat in the month of June that people wait for rains and look at the clouds in the sky in this hope.
A few days later, people will also wait for the moon.
The lunar appearance means that Eid can be considered.
After one month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the beginning of the celebration.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate Id with full enthusiasm and on this occasion, especially the children will get a good edi.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the binding of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
17 countries of the world, including India, participated in this.
When such a big event is being organised, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating in it, can imagine how the environment will be
And when there is an atmosphere of this kind, then who can keep it away from itself.
Our sportspersons also performed a very good performance on the hope of the countrymen and won a medal one after another.
Be it shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has performed a record.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze India won about 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for sportspersons to win medals.
It is a festival of pride for the entire country, for all the countrymen.
Perhaps the words will be reduced to me to express this feeling.
But I would like to listen to you from these players.
This time there were many things, which were the first time.
Do you know that this time the number of wrestlers who were from India in the Commonwealth Games has won medals.
Manika Batra won the medal in all the events.
She is the first Indian woman who won the gold medal in the Individual Table Tennis.
India has got maximum medals in shooting.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power-lifter to win the medal at the Commonwealth Games.
It was also special for this time that most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, women sportspersons have wondered.
In Bedminton, only two Indian players Saina Nehru and P.
V.
Sindhu was amongst us.
The athletes who participated in the games came from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends have also contributed, who maintained their courage in every situation.
I extend my best wishes and best wishes to all those players.
Last month, during the Mann Ki Baat, I had called for Fit India with the countrymen, especially with our youth and I invited everyone to connect with fit India and lead a fit India.
A gentleman Mr. Shashikant Bhonsle has written sharing one of his photographs in swimming pool that - my weapon is my body, my woman is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel myself optimistic and healthy with Morning Walk.
And he further says - for me - fitness comes with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Happinness is fitness.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Many other youngsters have shared their experiences by connecting with Fit India Forts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for all of us.
21st June, the Mahatma Gandhi of International Yoga Day has now been accepted by the whole world.
Prepare you from now on.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been shown is now becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now be in the worries of exams, exams and exams.
How to celebrate the holidays, I would like to think of where to go.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to revive and experience life away from the computer.
My young friends, I urge you for a special internship today.
Three Ministries of the Government of India have launched a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 in collaboration with the three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, HRD, Drinking Water Department.
The students and students of the college, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendra, those who want to do something for the society, for the country, for the country, for the change of society, those who want to be connected to themselves, for the purpose of making a positive energy, for all of them this is the opportunity and this will also strengthen the cleanliness and when we will be satisfied with Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary from 2nd October, and I will also tell you that the best international who has done good work in colleges, those who have done good work in colleges, will be awarded at the national level.
Every intern that successfully fulfills this internship will be given a certificate through the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only this, the Internet will complete it very well, the UGC will also provide them two credit points.
I invite the students, the students and the youngsters to take advantage of the internship.
You can go to MyGov app and register for Swach Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youngsters will further this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your months, send stores, send photographs, send video.
Let us create an opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience.
I have seen in the past that the youngsters of Delhi were talking about who are engaged in selflessness for the education of poor children.
This campaign, which started from 15 children in huts near Gita Colo in Delhi, has now been linked to 2,000 children at 12 places in the capital.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this Bhagirath effort to bring about a free time of 2 hours from their busy days.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become inspirational sources for the farmers across the country.
Their organized efforts not only changed their fortunes but also their regions.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated in ragi, Rajgra, maize or barley.
Because of being a hilly area, the farmers could not get the right value of it.
But the farmers of Kapkot taluka, instead of selling this crop directly to the market, they adopted the path of value addition.
What he did - started making biscuits from this fertilizer product and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative body in Munnar village and have also started a biscuit factory.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now being delivered not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual turnover of the institute has reached up to Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs, but at the same time, more than 100 families have also been able to stop the exit from the districts due to employment opportunities.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that in the future there is a war with water in the world.
Everyone speaks this thing, but whether we have any responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it alive for centuries.
He has given priority to the importance of one drop of water.
They have discovered such new ways that how one drop of water should be saved .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system, dry weather management and its big inscriptions have been written in temples.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will be able to see big inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to Chand Bau in Jodhpur.
It is one of the biggest and beautiful ponds of India and the point of view is that it is in the area where water is deficient.
April, May, June, July is such a time that there is an excellent opportunity to storage rain water and if we prepare in advance, we get the same benefit.
Manrega's budget also works for water conservation.
During the last three years, everyone has made efforts in the direction of water conservation and water management.
Every year, about 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management from the MNREGA budget.
Talking about 2017-18, I have spent 55 per cent of the total cost of Rs. 64 thousand crore i.e. about 35 thousand crore on water conservation.
Over the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted through such water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have taken advantage of the budget available by the Government of India for water conservation and water management.
Thousands of people working on the river Kuttumberur in Kerala have worked hard for 70 days and revived the river.
There are rivers full of Ganga and Yamuna but there are some areas in Uttar Pradesh like two small rivers named Sasur Khadri of Fatehpur district have dried up.
A large number of soil and water conservation work under MNREGA has been accelerated by the district system.
With the help of people from about 40-45 villages, this river Khadri, which was dried up, revived it.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, this is a success with blessings.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June, July are in front of us, we should take any responsibility for water conservation, we should also make some schemes, we should also show something.
When Mann Ki Baat happens, I have messages, papers and phones from all sides.
Iyen Kumar Banerjee has written in his convention on MyGov in Devetola village of North 24 Parg district of West Bengal, we celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year but many people do not know about the philosophy of the Nobel Prize winner Ravindranath Tagore's peaceful, beautyful and integrity.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, discuss this subject so that people can know about it.
I express my gratitude to Ayen ji that all the friends of Mann Ki Baat attracted the attention of this.
Gurudev Tagore was full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings have left an indelible mark on everybody.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but a teacher within him can experience every moment.
He wrote in Geetanjali, "He, who has known the responsibility to impart it to the students.
I do not know Bengali language but when I was young, I had a habit of getting up very early - from childhood and radio of East India starts soon.
When late starts in western India, I estimate that till 5. 30 am Ravindra Music was started, on radio and I had a habit of it.
I had a habit of listening to Ravindra Music by waking up early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to hear those poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmo.
You must have been impressed by Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated worldwide with full respect and respect.
The social aspect of Roza is that when a person is very hungry, he also feels the hunger of another.
When he himself is thirsty, he feels the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood from their lives.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what work is the best in Islam
Paigambar Saheb said - feeding a poor and needy and meeting with everyone with harmony, even if you know it or not.
Paigambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
They were not afraid of anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Pyagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have any goods more than required, then you give it to a needy person, so donating in Ramzan is also of great importance.
People donate the needy people in this holy month.
Pyagambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is immortal with his soul, not with wealth and wealth.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showcased the power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided lakhs of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibilities of Lord Buddha, trying to walk on his path, resolution and reminds us of all.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human values that are the highest in today's world.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar stressed that in his social philosophy, Lord Buddha had a great inspiration.
Baba Saheb empowered crores of people who were oppressed, oppressed, deprived and laughed through the Constitution.
This cannot be a big example of compassion.
This compassion for the pain of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and took with them the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it has been happening in all times.
We have inherited the teachings of Lord Buddha in the entire Asia.
It has been linked to many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and many countries where this tradition of Buddha is associated with the teachings of Buddha and this is the reason why we are developing a framework for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of South-East Asia to Indias special Buddhist places.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India is part of the rehabilitation work of many Buddhist temples, including the centuries old grand Anand Mandir in Myanmar.
Today, in every place in the world, there is a lot of stiffness and human suffering and the teachings of Lord Buddha shows the way to eradicate hatred with compassion.
I wish all those who believe in Lord Buddha, who believe in the principles of compassion all over the world, Buddha Purnima.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the whole world so that we can take our responsibility to build a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard of the statues of Lafing Buddha, it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck, but very few people know that smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event of Indias defence history.
You would have wondered what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May, 18, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said addressing the nation and his words filled the country with a moment of pride, valour and happiness.
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
Nuclear tests were conducted at Pokhran, Rajasthan on the west of India on 11th May 18.
Indias testing was successful and in a way, India showcased its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked in the history of India as an exhibition of its military power.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world, it is necessary for inner strength, inner strength and peace.
Similarly, when you are strong in the form of a country, you can stay peaceful with all of you.
The month of May 18 is not merely important for the country that nuclear tests were conducted in this month, but it is important to do the same.
He showed to the whole world that India's land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can achieve policy and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra - Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan Jai-vigyan.
We can also get a new joy and new satisfaction to carry forward the journey that Atal ji had started in view.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Ramnavmi.
We have seen the strength of the name Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life.
On 26th January, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN (ASEAN) countries were here, they had come with a cultural team and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana before us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries in this territory of the world, are still creating the same inspiration and influence.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on Ramnavmi.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received a large number of letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments from all of you.
I read what Kamal Thakkar ji wrote about the launch of Sanskrit online course on MyGov.
It was very good to see your love for Sanskrit along with being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I would also urge them to consider what the audience of Mann Ki Baat works in the context of Sanskrit.
You read comments on Shriman Dhanshyam Kumar Ji, Village Baraker, District Nalanda, Bihar.
The concern that you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the land is very important.
Shri Shakal Shastri ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animal birds in summer.
I have delivered your feelings to all the audiences.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha ji, I would like to talk to the youth about their health this time.
They feel that in comparison to Asian countries, our youth is physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time we should talk to everyone in detail about health. Talk about Fit India.
And you all can drive the movement of Fit India together.
In the past, the French chief had visited Kashi and Mr. Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the views of this journey were touching and affecting the mind.
And he urged all the pictures, all the video social media to be broadcast.
Pashant ji, the Indian government had put the pictures on the same day on social media and NarendraModiApp.
Now you like them and retweet them, bring them to your friends.
From Chennai, darkness, Jayesh and many children have sent me the ideas of the gratitude cards that they have given behind the exam warrior book.
Blind, Jaish, I would like to tell you all the kids that these letters of yours get tired throughout my day.
All these letters, all these phone calls, comments, all that I could read, all that I could hear and there are many things that have touched my mind. Even if I talk about them, I will have to go continuously saying something or the other for months.
This time most of the letters are children who have written about the examination.
He has explained his plan on holidays.
In the summer, the animals have been worried about water for birds.
Farmers brothers and sisters have come to know about the activities being carried out across the country regarding Kisan Melas and Agriculture.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions are discussed during festivals.
That is, the words of our minds also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the words of our mind change the weather of somebody's life.
And why not
In these words, in your experiences, in these examples, all such inspirations, all such energy, all such intimacy, all the desire to do something for the country.
It has the power to change the weather of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters, how a rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has created new schools for poor children with his will power, then this country's immense will power is seen.
In this mission, Saidul sold households and collected money through donations.
Many travellers traveling in their cab liberally donated.
An engineer daughter gave her first salary
Thus, after 12 years of collection of money, the Bhagirath attempts made by Sadul Laskar brought the color and today due to his hard work, due to his determination, he is ready to become a 30-bed hospital in Puri village near Kolkata.
This is the power of New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed all over the world.
Today, in the youth, in women, in the backward classes, in the poor, in the middle class and in every class of the country, this belief is awakened or yes.
We can move forward and our country can move forward.
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hopes and aspirations.
This self-confidence will fulfil our resolution of New India and will fulfil our dreams.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why several letters have come in the field of agriculture.
This time I have also seen the discussions with the farmers on the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that every farmer should be connected to this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and those experiments should be implemented in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devi Lal ji, everyone regarded agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common life.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to emphasize the need for plants, trees and vegetation and excellent agricultural infrastructure.
Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of mass awareness on a large scale to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities for our farmers and to increase food and milk production.
In his 1997 speech, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji stressed the need for farmers to use new technology and innovate.
I had visited Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi in the past.
My interaction with the farmers brothers and sisters and scientists, knowing, understanding and innovation related to agriculture - all this was a pleasant experience for me, but the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there was the most impressed thing.
This state with a small area has done a lot of work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced a record manufacturing over the last five years in 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, the determination is strong and the mind is determined, it can be proved and shown.
Today, the hard work of the farmers is getting technology support so that the agricultural producer is getting a lot of strength.
In the letters that I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the price of support and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide the right price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the price of support for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages with the Wholesale Market and then with the Global Market.
Farmers do not have to go far away to sell their yields - for this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded with the necessary interface and connected with APMC and e-NAM platform.
That is, in a way, direct connectivity of any market in the country with the field is being created.
My dear countrymen, this year the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can one of the hundreds of millions of Indians pay a great tribute to Gandhiji
How can new activities be respected for this
I urge you all to share your thoughts with all of you through MyGov.
How should the logo of Gandhi 150
You should inform you about how to slogan or mantra or proclamation.
Together we all pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and recall Bapu and take inspiration from them to bring our country to new heights.
Thanks, Thanks, you are true and I believe that Swachh Bharat and a healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead of a conservative approach in the health sector.
Every work related to health in the country was first the responsibility of the Ministry of Health when all the departments and Ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Sanitation, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Protection or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on fordable health.
Proventive healthcare is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more awakened we will be aware of the preventive healthcare, the more will be beneficial to the individual, family and society.
Cleanliness is the first need for life to be healthy.
We all have taken the initiative as a country and the result of this has come that sanitation coverage has doubled to almost 80 in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of making health wellness centres across the country.
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a collective movement today and has reached home.
The International Yoga Day of this time has saved less than 100 days for June 21.
On the last three international Yoga Days, people took part in the country and everywhere in the world with great enthusiasm.
This time also we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and all for Yoga from now on.
With new interesting methods, Yoga has to popularize in children, youth, adults, in all ages, in men or women.
Though the country's TV and electronic media do different programmes on Yoga during the year, can we create awareness about Yoga from today to Yoga Day as a campaign
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need a yoga practitioner, but some people have made me Yoga teachers through their creativity and made 3D animated videos by my yoga.
I will share the video with you all so that we can practice asanas, pranayamas along with us.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that healthcare is within reach and nutritious, affordable and accessible for the common man.
The cost of heart stents for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The number of MBBS meetings in the existing 4 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
In order to provide better treatment and healthcare to the people across the country, new AIIMS are being opened in different states.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We all will see collective efforts to get rid of BB.
Years ago Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is successfully going on in the country, then Dr.
Ambedkar ji's vision of India as an industrial power is inspired for us today.
Today, India is emerging as a shining point in the global economy and today the highest FDI in the world is coming to India.
The whole world sees India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Industry development would be possible only in cities, it was the idea that led to Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar trusted the urbanization of India.
He did not want a person to always live his life in poverty.
He also believed that his poverty could not be eradicated only by partition of something among the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators and young entrepreneurs.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of ports and waterways during the 1930s and 1940s when only the matter of roads and railways was discussed in India.
He's Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as a nation power.
Emphasizing the use of water for the country's development, various River Vali Authorities and water related commissions - all this was Babasaheb Ambedkar's vision.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various coastal coasts of India and the interface is being strengthened at the old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were held in the context of the Second World War, the Cold War and Division.
Ambedkar had laid the foundation stone of Team India spirit in a way.
He spoke of the importance of coordination, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance, and the most important thing is that Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people like me who are associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary to be born in an elderly or an immortal family, but people born in the poor families of India can also dream, they can try to fulfil their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it was also a matter of fact that a lot of people have made Dr.
They tried to drag them back and every possible effort was made to ensure that the daughters of the poor and the backward families could not move forward, nothing could be made, nothing could be achieved in their lives.
But the picture of New India is very different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor and the backward.
Under this, there will be separate programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice throughout India.
My request to all of you will be enthusiastic in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, many festivals will come and Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life philosophy of Lord Mahavir Ji, the messenger of non-violence, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
When the discussion of Esther comes out, Lord Isa Christ remembers the inspirational teachings that have always sent a message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to humanity.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in these days, the joy and joy of Pilla Vaisak in Bihar, Judshital and Satuwain in Assam will remain in Assam.
All these festivals are attached to our agriculture and food donors in some form or the other, through these festivals, we thank nature for the invaluable gifts that we get in the form of yield.
Once again, my best wishes for all the festivals coming with you.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar today launches Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
Many questions related to science have been asked by my young friends and my young friends.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that be it the river or the sea, why the water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes to us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on light sketching.
One of his researches is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year as it is said that this day, the event of light skating was discovered, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there is a tradition of great mathematician Bodhyana, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta, and on the other hand we have a pride in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India.
In the name of Satyendranath Bose, the famous party Boson was also named.
Recently, I got the opportunity to be present in a programme in Mumbai - Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence for inauguration.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy better.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in facilitating the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in facilitating healthcare and cure the diseases in a modern way
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit the inauguration of I Create in Gujarat, Ahmedabad.
There, a young man developed a digital instrument that if no one can speak, he can interact with his interaction through instrument and can interact in the same way as a speaker interacts.
I understand that we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
The value of science and technology is sustainable.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do the same thing as we want.
However, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine.
Humanitarian objectives become important here.
Use of science for the welfare of mankind, to achieve the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered light bulbs, failed many times in his experiments.
It is fortunate that today I am in Auroville, the workplace of Maharishi Arabindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, raised questions on their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Searched the answers and waited for humanity.
In order to know the truth, the feeling of repeated questions is important.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific discovery.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science.
I extend my best wishes for our young generation to be inspired for the discovery of truth and knowledge, to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, At the time of crisis, I get a lot of messages related to security and disaster all these subjects and people keep writing something or the other.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on the subject of occupational safety in his comment on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that safety standards on factory and construction sites in our country are not so good.
On 4th March, Indias National Safety Day is the next day, the Prime Minister spoke of peace in his Mann Ki Baat programme so that people are aware of the safety.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other preparedness.
Safety is of two types - one which is required at the time of disaster, Safety During Disaster and the other which is required in daily life, Safety in Everide Life.
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we are not able to achieve it then it becomes difficult to achieve it during disasters.
We have often read the boards written on the roads. We have written in it: Carefulness Hati, accident reduction, loss of one mistake, loss of happiness and smile, do not leave the world quickly, do not make any joy or life cheaper, these words are never used in our life.
If we remain cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can protect our lives but we can emerge society from very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of information is written about safety at work place but whenever we see it, it does not seem to be followed.
I urge the municipalities that have fire brigades should go to different schools once a week or once a month and drive them to the school children.
There will be two benefits - Fire Brigade will also have a habit of being cautious and new generations also get their education and there is no different cost for it - in a way only a course of education remains there and I always urge this thing.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the disaster management in the country.
The initiative called Apada Mitra has also been taken to train volunteers in floods, cyclone risk districts.
Training and awareness have a very big role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to Lu-Heatwave.
After that, he organised a workshop to prevent NDMHW and launched a campaign to bring awareness among the people.
A good result came from everyone's participation.
The number of deaths due to Lou in 2017 has come down surprisingly to about 20.
It can be observed that if we give priority to security then we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, there are social organisations, aware citizens - I would like to extend to all those who have disasters, get relief and rescue within minutes.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is nothing less.
(BIMSTEC) - Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, a Joint Disaster Management Exercise of these countries was also conducted, which was the first and the largest human experiment in itself.
We have to become a Risk Conscience Society.
In our culture, we always talk about the preservation of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of value of safety.
We have to make it a part of our life.
This means what was the arrangement of giving information
Because, we are not aware of nature and that is why our ears are heard after sitting in the air, but no one of us feels that this information is for me.
Such an experience is in every sphere of our life.
We should not think that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our security then the feeling of security of the society is also included.
The objective of this 'GobarDhan' scheme is to make the villages clean and to generate wealth and energy by transforming the solid waste of animal dung and fields into compost and bio gas.
Some European countries and China, animal dung and other biological abstracts are used for the production of energy, but its full potential is not being used in India.
We are now moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
The goal of using dung dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen and biogas-based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only in the form of waste but also in the form of source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping the villages clean, better animal health and increase productivity.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy matters for cooking food and lighting.
Farmers and animal husbandry will help in increasing income.
There will be new employment opportunities for Waste Collection, Transportation, Selling of Biogas etc.
An online trading platform will also be set up for a smooth system of 'Gobar Dhan Yojana' which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating self-help groups.
I invite you to participate in this movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs. Initiate in the direction of converting waste into wealth in your village and making cow dung from cow dung.
My dear countrymen, we have been listening to music festivals, food festivals and film festivals so far.
But a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh in which the first waste festival was organized in the state.
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the cleanliness and creative use of the waste of the city and to create awareness about various ways of reuse the carbag.
During this festival, there were various activities in which from students to adults, all were involved.
Different types of artifacts were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of the Waste Management.
Music performance on the theme of cleanliness, art work has been built.
Inspired by Raipur, different kinds of waste festivals took place in other districts.
Innovative ideas, discussions and poems were read by everyone initiating cleanliness from their own side.
An atmosphere like a festival has emerged in the context of cleanliness.
The way school children participated enthusiastically, it was amazing.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration there for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is also being honoured by women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the past.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
It is our collective duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life. It is the responsibility of all of us.
We are part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodanandan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today, our women power has introduced self-reliance and self-reliance from their works.
He has not only taken himself forward, but has also taken the country and society forward and taken it to a new stage.
Finally, our dream of New India is that where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the past, I had made a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March, there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day. Can every village and city be honoured with mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years
And can we talk about a long life in it
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women are not small and 15 lakh women have organized a one-month Swachhta Abhiyan.
Starting from 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example in just 20 days by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
You can imagine how big is this event
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has a power that will transform the cleanliness mission and the culture of cleanliness in the common life into the nature of the common man effectively.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was seeing in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and that is why the people there are great joy and enthusiasm.
You all know well that Elephanta Island is ten kilometres away from Mumbai in the sea.
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
The darkness in the lives of the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sethbandar, three villages of Elephanta Islands for 70 years has now become dark and their life has become illuminating.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am happy that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted with electricity.
This is not just a new beginning of electricity but also a new beginning of development.
The lives of the people of the country should be illuminated, their lives should be joyful and more satisfying than that.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the splendid feature of this month, the decorated fields, the golden tail of enjoying wheat and the splendor of the mango that enhances the mind.
But this month is also very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi.
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with joy.
The importance of Holi is the same as the importance of Holika Dahan because this day is the day to destroy the evils by burning them in the fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to sit together forgotten all the souls, to participate in each other's pleasure and gives a message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and colorful greetings to all of you people on the festival of Holi.
May this festival be filled with colorful joys in the lives of our people.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Festival with great zeal and for the first time in history, the greatest 10 countries were present in this function.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on the NarendraModiApp and has urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He wrote that the imagination going to space on February 17 is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Columbia spacecraft but inspired millions of youth from all over the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he started his long letter with the departure of imagination of Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for all that we lost imagination Chawla at such a young age, but he gave a message to thousands of young people of India from his life, especially in the world, that there is no limit for women's power.
If there is a desire and determination, if there is a strong desire to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that today women in India are moving forward at a rapid pace and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place and their contribution in the society has been amazing the whole world.
There has been a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Many scholars of India have contributed to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi, are many names.
Today we talk about 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' but centuries ago we have been told in our scriptures, 'Skandpurana': Dashuputra Samakanya, Dashuputrana Pradhayan.
The more sacred will be received from ten daughters, the more sacred will be received from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And that is why in our society, women have been given the status of power.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the form of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given a lot of examples.
He wrote that our adventure defence Prime Minister Nirmala Sitharaman flew to the Fighter Aircraft Sukhoi 30 is inspiring.
He also mentioned that under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, the women crew members of the Indian Navy are circumambulating the entire world on INSV Tarini.
Three brave women have become Bhavwan Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avani Chaturvedi fighter pilots and are taking training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Capacity Vajpayee, Ol Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco, USA and Delhi to Air India Boating Jets and all the ladies back.
In the past, Honble President has taken a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who first performed something in their respective fields.
These women's acquaintances, first female merchant naval captain, first female train driver of passenger train, first female firefighter, first female bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Everest, thus first ladies of every sector.
Our women powers have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservation of society and establishing a record.
He pointed out that a new path can be created by crossing all the obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, determination and determination.
A path that will not only inspire the people of their times but also the generations to come.
He will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book has also been prepared on this Women Achieveer, First Ladies so that the entire country can know about these women powers, take inspiration from their lives and their works.
It is also available in the form of e-book on Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of the country has an important role in the positive change in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment, you would have been wondering what is the relationship between them
The Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are.
Whether it is a woman staff or a commercial department, a railway police, a ticket checker, an audience, a point person, a staff of more than 40 employees in all the departments.
This time, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after watching the Republic Day parade that one of the key points of the parade was the BSF Bike Continent, in which all the women were participating.
It was experimenting with adventure and it was also surprising to the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our women power is leading.
When it comes to the tribal women, there is a definite picture in the minds of all, in which there are jungles, footpaths and women walking high on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, this woman power has created a new picture before the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible atmosphere of violence, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
Tribal women are becoming self-sufficient by running e-rickshaws in such a dangerous area.
In a short span of time, many women have been associated with it.
And there are three benefits. On the one hand, where self-employment has worked to empower them, on the other hand, the image of Maoist-affected area is changing.
And with all this, it is also strengthening the work of environmental protection.
Continuous efforts have been made in our country at the personal and social level for centuries against social practices and evils.
Just a few days ago, Bihar has taken an interesting initiative.
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers has been created.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of evils like burning and burning practices.
The entire state took a pledge to fight with rituals like Dahej and Child Marriage.
Youngsters, mothers and sisters, full of zeal and enthusiasm, everybody had participated in this jungle.
The human chain that started from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna has been linked unbreakablely to the borders of the state.
It is important for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in true sense that our society is free from these evils.
Let us all take a pledge to end these evils from the society and build a New India, a Powerful and Sustainable India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration and every person involved in the human chain who has taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Mysore, Mr. Darshan of Karnataka has written on MyGov: The cost of medicines used to be Rs.
He was not aware of the earlier Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Kendra.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, the cost of their medicines has decreased by 5.
He expressed his desire that I should talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that they can get information about it to the maximum number of people and take advantage of it.
For the past, many people used to write and tell me about this subject.
I have also seen video and social media of many people who have benefitted from this scheme.
And when I get this kind of information then I am very happy.
A deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had thought that he got what he got from others too.
The objective behind this scheme is to make healthcare offordably and promote Ease of Living.
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 0 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday, and saves them a lot.
The generic medicines sold in it are according to the standards of the World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides cheaper medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the Amrit Stores of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind all these is to make the poorest of the country availability of quality and fordable health services so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photo was such that my attention was drawn towards that photo.
There was a photograph in which a grandfather was participating in the cleanliness drive of Clean Morana River with her grandfather.
I am told that the citizens of Akola had organized a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morana river used to flow twelve months earlier but now it has become a seasonal.
The other painful thing is that the river was completely filled with wild grass and water well.
Some waste was being put on the river and its banks.
An action plan was prepared and under the first phase of Mission Clean Morana, one day before the Makar Sankranti, four kilometres area was cleaned on both the banks of the river Morana.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, adults, mothers and sisters participated in this naked work of Mission Clean Morna.
Even on 20th January, 2018, this Swachhta Programme was continued in such a way and I was told that till the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then nothing is impossible.
A big change can be brought through the mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, to the district and municipal administration of the city and to every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you have heard many discussions about the Padma Awards.
The newspapers also attract attention to this subject on TV.
But if you look at it easily then you will be proud of the fact that how great people are among us and it will naturally be proud of the fact that today the common man in our country is reaching these heights without any feeling.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding the Padma Awards, but in the last three years, the entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
Transparency has come from the entire process being online.
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become a complete transformation.
Now the significance of the person is not being identified for the award but his work is increasing.
You will be happy to know that Shri Arvind Gupta Ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, Arvind Ji has dedicated his entire life in making sports for children.
They are making sports from waste for four decades so that children can increase their curiosity towards science.
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, for which they are inspiring children by visiting three thousand schools across the country to showcase films made in 18 languages.
How a wonderful life, how a wonderful dedication.
One such thing is the Sitava joditi of Karnataka.
He was not called the goddess of women empowerment.
In the last three decades, he has contributed greatly to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women.
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven, but later he laid his entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
I would have heard the name of Bhajju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh. Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family and tribal family.
He used to do normal jobs for lifestyle but he was keen to make traditional tribal paintings.
Today, because of this grief, he is not only in India but also in the whole world.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy.
The talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who illuminated India abroad, was recognised and honored with Padma Shri.
You will be happy to hear the story of the tribal lady Laxmikutti of Kerala.
Lakshmikutti is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
He made five hundred herbal medicines based on his memories.
He has got Maharath in making medicines used after snake bites.
Lakshmiji is constantly serving the society with his knowledge of herbal medicines.
Identifying this innocent person, he was honored with Padmashree for his contribution to the society.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and that incident inspired him to make a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hard work hospital.
I am confident that there are many such male and females in our multi-ratna Vasundhara, no one knows or knows them.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who work for the society, who are dedicated to the society, who work for some or the other specialty, who should be brought to the society sometimes.
They do not work for dignity but their works inspire us.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should be called and listened to their experiences.
There should be some efforts in the society even beyond the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the 9th January when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
On that day we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bonds between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a programme in which every member of Indian origin from all over the world invited the Mayors.
You will be happy to know that from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portuguese, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and other countries where our original Indian mayor has participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries and they have made strong relations with India as well. This time, I have sent a calendar to the European Union and the European Union in which they have demonstrated their contribution in various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in a cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who shook the minds of the society with their own music and some of their poems.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and informing people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
At present, we need every step to see how true Bapu's words were.
If we pledge that we should walk on the path of Bapu, as much as we can walk, what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, along with congratulations to all of you for 2018, I cease to stop my speech.
Mann Ki Baat December 2019
This is the last event of this year's Mann Ki Baat and see that today is also the last day of the year 2019.
We and you shared a lot of things this year.
Many of your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat have always brought a new energy to me.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this order of our talk will continue in the same way.
In the coming years, we will share more innovative things, new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Recently, on 25th December, the festival of Natal was celebrated worldwide with great fanfare.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we all recall the great teachings of Christianity and Isha Messiah was the most insistent on service.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th light festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Guru Gobind Singh jis courage and sacrifice are a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived his life on the basis of these values.
A Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against harassment and injustice.
He advised people to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave place to the feeling of hatred.
In every moment of life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all the pledges and take inspiration from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his inspirational life and try to improve his life accordingly.
Those who are born in 2000 or after that will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
Indian democracy welcomes the 21st century voters for the New India Voters.
I congratulate these youngsters and urge all of you to register as your voters.
The entire India is eager to welcome you as the 21st century electorate.
As the voters of the 21st century, you will also be proud.
Your vote will become the basis of New India.
The power of vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
The vote is the most effective instrument for bringing positive changes in the lives of lakhs of people.
However, you can also become a manufacturer of the 21st century India and it is being specifically started from January 1.
And today in my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to the successful youth of 18 to 25 years of energy and resolve.
I believe that the skills and strength of our youngsters will realise the dream of New India.
When we talk about a New India, a New India which is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India where there is equal opportunity for all, where the aspirations and aspirations of all are fulfilled.
New India where we have an inspirational strength of peace, unity and harmony.
My New India Youth will come forward and deliberate on how to become a New India.
They should also set a path for themselves, connect them with which they are connected and keep moving forward.
You should also move forward and the country will also move forward.
When I am talking to you today, I was wondering whether we can organize a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Where these youths from 18 to 25 years sit together and churn on New India, find ways and plans.
How will we realize our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters had dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, it is time for us to create a mass movement for the magnificent divine India of the 21st century.
How to achieve success with determination
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and are successful.
I would like this New India Youth to be aware of all these opportunities at one place and a system in this regard should be created so that they can easily get information about all these things about the world as soon as they are 18 years old and they can take the necessary advantage.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I spoke to you about the importance of positiveness.
I remember a sloka of Sanskrit, "It means that a person full of enthusiasm is extremely strong because nothing can be ahead of enthusiasm.
Nothing is impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People also say in English - 'Pessimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power'.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I appealed to the people of the country to tell you your positive moments of the year 2019 and welcome 2018 in a positive environment.
I am very happy that a large number of people gave a very positive impression on the social media platform, MyGov and the NarendraModi App and told their experiences.
Millions of tweets have been made with positive India hashtag, which has reached more than 1. 5 crore people.
In a way, the communication of positiveness that happened in India spreads across the world.
The tweets and talents that came were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have shared the events of this year which have had a positive impact on their minds.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Faiz One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I talk to the Bodle.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
He had done it by my husband and died in an accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
With this help of the government, we got a lot of benefit and I could have a few meetings.
My name is satisfaction.
Our village has passed the National Highway from Bhinnar village to 2019.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and trade will also increase.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Beni.
There was a problem of water in our area and for the last 40 years we had to rely on the army pipeline.
Now this pipeline has become separately - free.
So all these are major achievements in our 2019.
There are many people who are doing such work at their own level, which is making positive changes in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Let us enter the New Year, start the New Year with the joy of these smaller joys and take a strong step towards positive India.
When we talk about positiveness, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the motivation of the topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak of administrative service in Kashmir.
He has achieved the first position in the Kashmir Administrative Service exam, emerging from the hatred of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that the 10th terrorists had burnt their homes.
There was so much terrorism and violence that his family had to leave their ancestral land and get out.
For a small child, the atmosphere of all such violence was sufficient for the creation of darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration not only for the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that how bad the situation is, the clouds of despair can also be spread through positive actions.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The zeal that was in them, the zeal that was in them, the dreams that were in them, and when I was listening to them, they want to progress in the field of life.
The time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
Every year crores of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
Where such a large number of devotees come, there is a big challenge to maintain cleanliness in the place where there is such a great Mahatma
And especially those places that are located between mountains and forests.
But how this problem can be converted into culture, how the way out of the problem can be discovered and how much strength is there in public participation, the Sabarimala temple itself is an example.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan launched a programme 'Punyam Punkwanam' and launched a voluntary campaign for cleanliness under the programme.
And made such a tradition that the journey of those travellers who come is not complete till they don't do any physical work in the cleanliness programme.
There is no bigger or smaller in this campaign.
Considering the part of the worship of God, every traveller gives some time for cleanliness, works for removing dirt.
Every morning the sight of cleanliness is very unique and all the pilgrims get involved in it.
Whether it is a big CELEBRITY, whether it is a rich person, whether it is a big officer or not, every person becomes a part of this 'Punyam Punkwanam' programme like a common traveler.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan and the Punyama Punkwanam, which has been so advanced in Sabarimala, become a part of the journey of every passenger.
There is also a strong resolve of cleanliness along with a tough turmoil.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we all have pledged that the incomplete work of revered Bapu i. e.
Revered Bapu continued to strive for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary, we should do something in the direction of giving him an India of his dream, a clean India.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country in the direction of cleanliness.
Changes are also seen in rural and urban areas due to comprehensive public participation.
To examine the sanitation level achievements in urban areas, the worlds largest survey - Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March 2018.
This survey will be conducted in more than four thousand cities with a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this Survey include open defecation free in cities, collection of waste, transportation system to carry waste, scientific processing of waste, efforts to be done for behavioral change, innovative efforts made for capacity building and sanitation and public participation for this work.
During this survey, separate groups will go and inspect the cities.
He will interact with the citizens and respond to them.
The analysis will analyze the use of Swachhta App and improve various types of serviceplaces.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the habit of the people and become the habit of the city.
Cleanliness should not be the only government.
Every citizen and civil organisation has a great responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to take part in the Swachhata Survey that is going to happen in the coming days.
And your city should not be left behind, your streets should not be left behind.
I am confident that the use of green and blue waste by separating dry waste and wet waste from home will now become your habit.
In the Swachhta Survekshan that takes place from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this health competition of cleanliness - it should become a subject of public discussion in every city.
And you all should have a dream, our city - our effort, our progress - the progress of the country.
Let us recall the revered Bapu once again with this resolution and take the pledge of Swachh Bharat and pursue Purushartha.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small but in the form of a society, our identity is affecting far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
One thing came in our knowledge that if a Muslim woman wants to go for Haj pilgrimage, she cannot go without 'Maharam' or her male guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how could this happen
Who would have made such rules
Why does this distinction come
And when I went into its depths, I was distressed - even after 70 years of independence, those who put such a restrictation were ours.
There was injustice to Muslim women for decades but there was no discussion about it.
Even in many Islamic countries, this is not the rule.
But Muslim women in India did not get this right.
And I am happy that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has also taken these necessary steps and we have removed this reservoir by abolishing the tradition that lasted for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without Mehram and I am happy that this time about 1300 Muslim women have applied to go to Haj without Mehram and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to north, they have expressed their desire to travel enthusiastically.
I say with full faith and I firmly believe that the development journey of India, on the strength of our women power, the confidence of their talent will continue to move forward and will continue to move forward.
We must strive to ensure that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities for men so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic festival for us.
On Republic Day, there will be not one but ten chief guests this time.
This has never happened in the history of India before.
2017, ASEAN and India have been special for both.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this festival is a season of festivals and in a way our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written.
Now we all have accepted Christmas and a new year will come forward.
The coming New Year brings immense happiness, happiness and prosperity for you all.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new resolutions.
The month of January is the time of sun rise and Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the same month.
If Lohari enjoys Punjab and North India, then there is a wait for Khichdi and Silk Revolution in UP-Bihar.
Say Sankranti in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, this festival is special in itself and they have their own importance.
This festival is celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
The names of each of these festivals are different, but its original elements are the same - connectivity with nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to every countrymen on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much to the countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
The conversation was such that he talks with his elder brothers and sisters with a lot of interest.
Listen to how in this phase of AYUSH, Lata Dadi is eager for all things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in progress of India, is changing India, is touching new heights in India.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pramanam.
I am speaking to Shri Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Prayam.
Modiji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go and roam the layer
Modi ji: I will return late at 28th night and at 27th morning and then it will be your birthday.
Lataji: It is a big thing to get the blessings of the elderly and some people who are bigger than their own work.
Modi ji: Dadi ji, you are very big in age and are also big in work and you have achieved this achievement by meditation and penance.
Netaji: Yes, I think my parents are blessed and the blessings of the audience are there.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Today is your humility, it is a big education for all of our new generations.
It is a big inspiration for us that even after clearing all this in life, your parents' culture and humility have always been given priority.
Lataji: G.
Modi ji: And I am glad that when you are proud that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you ji: G Modi ji: Give me some or the other Gujarati.
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival and I am very happy with that.
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see, I know how busy you are and how much work you have.
What do we have to think
When you came to touch your mother's feet, I also sent somebody to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes.
Modi ji: My father was very happy, because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
This will be my privilege.
Modi ji: Prayer Dadi.
Your Lataji: very greetings.
Modi ji: Pramanam ji
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal, new energy, new enthusiasm and new determination.
It is the season of festivals.
Festivals will be illuminated throughout the country for several weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps this saying is not just a word, for all of us, there is an order, a philosophy, a motivation.
In some households sweets get spoiled and in some households children sweets for sweets.
This is the darkness on the bottom of the lamp.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this darkness comes down, this darkness comes down and light spreads.
We shall share happiness where there is a shortage and it will also become our nature.
Think about giving sweets, clothing, gifts and delivery to each other in our households.
At least, share such things in our households which we do not take in any work.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends of several NGs work like this.
They collect clothes, sweets, meals and food from the houses of the people and discover the needy and reach them secretly.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with complete awareness and determination, the darkness can be eradicated by this lamp
The smiths on the face of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals and your face will glow.
Your light will become more light and your Diwali will become more light.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmiji comes home in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Laxmiji is welcome in a traditional way.
Can we keep the honourable programmes in our society, in villages, in cities and daughters this time
Can you keep public programmes
There will be many daughters among us who will be enlightening the name of the family, society and the country with their hard work and talent.
Can we honour this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters and sisters around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone would have been educating the poor children, somebody would have been engaged in spreading awareness about hygiene and health, somebody would have been serving society by becoming a doctor and engineer.
Being a lawyer, I would have been trying to bring justice to someone.
Our society should identify, respect and pride these daughters.
His honour will be held across the country.
Promotion of Indias Lakshmi means pave the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said earlier that Mann Ki Baat has a big advantage that I have the privilege of interacting directly with many unknown people.
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when the results of my examination came, some people asked me to read the exam warriors book
I have not read this book.
But after returning, I read this book and read it twice or three times.
My experience was very good about it.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination, I would have had a lot of benefits.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing this letter.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors 2-3 times.
Whatever you have said that if I can take time for a new recurring, I will definitely try to write some things for parents and teachers in it.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me your experience about the aspects related to stress-free examinations.
So I will wait for your ideas.
I once again express my gratitude to our young friend of Arunachal, student Ali Na Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through television and through newspapers.
But you know that I am also a common man like you.
I am a common citizen and therefore, the impact of things that affects in a common life is also on my mind because I have also come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he won the Grand Slum and the story of Tennis, Rafael Nadal, once again in the final.
His speeches were welcomed by the audience.
Even after losing the difficult challenge, he praised his rival drama and proved the living of the sportsperson.
However, on the other hand, the winner drama also appreciated the Daniel Games.
The humility of the losers and the humility of the winners was both worth seeing.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev then I will tell you all, especially the youth to see this video.
The ideals of our ancestors are really commendable.
We say in the scriptures there: i.e., when a person gets qualification and humility together, then whose heart can not win
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to do is being done directly for your welfare.
The debate will continue, the opposition will continue, but if some things are stopped before it grows then there will be a lot of benefits.
It becomes very difficult to stop the things that increase very much and spread very much later.
But if we get awake and stop it in the beginning, a lot can be saved.
My heart says that with this feeling, today, especially the young friends, do some things.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to leave its addiction.
The risk of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases to people who consume tobacco.
Everybody says this.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to nicotine present in it.
In adolescence its consumption also affects the development of the brain.
But today I would like to talk to you on a new topic.
You will be aware that recently there has been a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
Different e-cigarettes from common cigarettes are a type of electronic equipment.
In e-cigarettes, nicotine containing liquid substances are heated and a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is used.
We understand the danger of common cigarettes very well, but a misconception about e-cigarettes has been created.
There has been confusion that there is no threat to e-cigarettes.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, the aromatic chemicals were obtained in it for not spreading stink.
We have seen around that even if the father is a Chinese memorial at home, he stops the rest of the households from smoking, smokes and wants his children not to get cigarettes and bidi habits.
They make such efforts that no member of the family should smoke, do not smoke.
They know that smoking and tobacco causes heavy damage to the body.
The drinkers also know and the watchers also know.
However, e-cigarette matters are very different.
There is no such awareness among the people about e-cigarettes.
They are also completely familiar with the danger and because of this, sometimes e-cigarettes enter the house quietly in curiosity and sometimes I am showing magic and children continue to show each other.
Look, I drive smoke from my mouth, see, I drive smoke without putting fire, without burning lamps.
Once the adolescents and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches, then gradually they become intoxicants and become victims of bad addiction.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in e-cigarettes, which have a bad effect on health.
You know that when someone smokes around us, we know it with smell.
Even when there is a cigarette packet in his pocket, it is known with smell.
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are roaming around in their pockets, in their offices, in their pockets and sometimes they become victims of it.
Young generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarettes have been banned so that this new way of drug addiction cannot ruin our young country.
The dreams of every family should not be wasted and the lives of children should not be ruined.
This disease, this habit cannot root in the society.
I urge you all to quit tobacco intoxication and do not have any misconception regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us all together build a healthy India.
To avoid all these things is for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for all of us that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of extraordinary people who have dedicated their entire life not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
This is our mother of India, this is our country's polytheistic hometown.
Many human rituals emerge from this land.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people.
And these are the people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves, but for others.
One such great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pop will declare Marium Threasia on 13th October, 2018 to come to France.
The work done by Sister Maryam Threass in his small lifetime of 50 years for the welfare of humanity is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work Sister Threasia has done, he has fulfilled it with dedication and dedication.
Those who are still moving forward their vision and mission.
I once again pay homage to Sister Marium Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, not only India but also today it is a matter of pride for the entire world that today when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, along with that, 130 crore Indians have pledged to get rid of single use plastic.
Considering the kind of leadership that India has led in the entire world in the direction of environmental protection, today the eyes of all the countries are on India.
I am confident that all of you will become part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way.
But one of the youngsters of our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
When I noticed his work, I talked to him on phone and tried to know about this new experiment.
It may be that their words should also be used to other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a good effort.
When I heard the plogging word for the first time, it was also new for me.
Perhaps that word has been used in some quantities abroad.
But in India, Ripudaman Belvi ji has very popularized it.
Friends, This time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing a Fit India Planging Run.
We have heard how to do this programme, what happens in the programme with the experience of Repudaman ji.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction then our India will move ahead with 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, thanks to Ripudaman ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into national interest.
There is a desire to remember one thing quickly.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely do it from the area but I am telling you just a while ago so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that on 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On that day we have to run for the unity of the country in thousands of villages of India, children, elderly, all the people, schools and colleges.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and if it is possible then make a program to stay for one night and two nights.
You see, understand and experience India.
How many diversities we have, and when the holidays come in this festival, people definitely go and therefore, I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
And how much is this reform, where am I to you
You will definitely be happy that today our rank is 34 and five years ago our rank was 65th, so in a way we have made a big punch.
If we make more efforts, we will make our place in the world's leading tourism by 5 years of independence.
Yes, you must also see that in the days of Diwali, there is no loss of fire or any person due to fireworks etc.
You must take any precautions for this.
There should also be happiness, there should be happiness, there should be enthusiasm and our festivals also bring the fragrance of collectiveness, the culture of collectiveness.
It is a collective life that gives a new strength and it is a festival that is the centre of the new capabilities.
Let us celebrate festivals with enthusiasm and enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolutions.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
My countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the child friends of Karnataka.
The Vijay Karnataka newspaper of the Times Group initiated Baladi to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And then he published some of the selected letters.
I read those letters, I felt very good.
These young children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
These children have written on several subjects, Kirti Hegde of Northern Kannada has suggested that we need to change our education system by describing Digital India and Smart City Schemes, he added that nowadays children do not want to study in classrooms.
And if we consider the children about nature then perhaps it can help us in protecting the environment.
Reeda Nadafe has written from Laxmeshwar that she is the daughter of a soldier.
And he said that due to lack of school, I cannot spend time with my friends. He has suggested that there should be a nearby school.
This was also a good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On the 14th day, the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whenever he reads the discussion, we are proud of what is the idea of dedicated life to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard they have worked to build the constitution of our country with diversity
Have you philosophy of understanding and vision and that too at a time when the country was getting free from the slavery of slavery.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India by keeping in mind the thoughts of the great men.
Our Constitution is very widespread.
Perhaps there is no such area of life, there is no subject that he has not touched.
Equality for all and sensitivity towards all is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the basic rights of every citizen, the poor, the dalit, the backward, the deprived, the tribal, the women.
And protects their interests.
It is our duty to follow the letters of the Constitution.
Be it a citizen or administrator should move forward in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Seventy different committees were constituted in this Constituent Assembly on important topics.
It was one of the most important committees and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this issue committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, we feel pride in the Constitution of India, there is an indelible mark of the skilled leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
He ensured that every section of the society benefits.
On 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana day, we salute him by remembering him as eternal.
Babasaheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
On the fifteenth December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the death anniversary.
Sardar Patel, who made the country's iron man from the farmer's son, had done an extraordinary task to build the country with a talent.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Consultative Committee for Fundamental Rights, Minorities and tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day but on 26-11, nine years ago, the terrorists attacked Mumbai, how can the country forget it
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Today, if terrorism sees in every part of the world and in one way, it has become a horrific form of every day event.
We have been tolerating a lot in India for the last 40 years due to terrorism.
There were many people in the world who were not ready to take it seriously, but today when terrorism is shouting their own windows, every government in the world believes in humanity, the governments who trust in democracy, the governments who have seen terrorism as a big challenge.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanitarianism.
It is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but also all humanitarian forces in the world have been defeating terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi, are the rituals of this land that have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism weaken our social tensions and makes nefarious efforts to distinguish them.
And that is why it is the demand of this time that humanitarian forces become more aware.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will observe Naval Day.
The Indian Navy is protecting and protecting our coastline.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our civilization is surrounding the banks of the rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
It is our entrance for the whole world.
This country has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, during the Chaul dynasty, Chaulnavi-Chaulanukala was considered to be one of the most powerful ships.
In the extension of the Chaul Empire, it was a very big part of his navy in making it an economic superiority of that time.
Several exhibitions are found in Sangam literature, the humble and search journeys of the Chaul Navy.
Very few people would be aware that women had got permission on ships of war late in most of the world's ships.
However, in the Chaulan Navy and that too, eight hundred nine hundred years ago, women played a very important role in the fighting.
Chaul rulers had a very rich knowledge of building ships and construction of ships.
When we talk about the naval then who can forget the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval forces.
The coastal coast of Konkan, where the Dariyas are very important, used to come under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj such as Sindhu Fort, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the coastal side or were surrounded by the sea.
The Marathi Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
Large vessels and small boats were integrated in the Maratha ship.
Their naval personnel were very skilled to attack any enemies and escape them.
And whenever we discuss the Maratha Navy, how can it be possible that Kanoji does not remember English
He carried the Maratha naval to a new height and set up camps of Maratha naval personnel at several places.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its valour at different times.
Whether it is a freedom struggle of Goa or an Indo-Pakistan war of 1991.
In May-June this year, whenever there was a terrible flood crisis in Sri Lanka, three ships of our ships immediately reached there and helped its government and its people.
In the month of September last year in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS Church also provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya.
In the last June, when the government of Papua-Nyugini sent us a message of talent and requested the fishermen of their fishermen boats to save them, our naval forces helped.
On the 21st of the day, our naval ship INS Trikund had also reached the rescue of a trading ship from Chanchia in the West Bay.
Our navy has always been working proudly to provide healthcare services to Fiji Islands, to provide immediate relief to the neighbouring country.
Every countrymen salute the courage, valour, valour and sacrifices of our soldiers, whether it is land, naval or air force.
Hundreds of crores of people of the country can live the life of Sukhchen so that the soldiers sacrifice their lives for the country.
Every year, we celebrate the 7th December as the Armed Forces Flag Day.
This is the day of pride and honour of the armed forces of the country.
I am glad that this time, the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from first to seven December, reaching the citizens of the country to make people aware about the Armed Forces and to make people aware.
Apply this flag on the chest for the whole week.
A movement of respect for the army will start in the country.
We can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces on this occasion.
You can post the experiences of those who are associated with the Armed Forces in their familiar partnerships around you, their courageous steps with video and photographs with them with the artforceflagday.
In schools and colleges, you can get information about the army by calling the soldiers of the army.
Our new generation can become a good opportunity to get respect for the army.
This festival also provides an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our armed forces.
The fund is spent by the Military Welfare Board on their rehabilitation for the welfare of the families and injured soldiers of the martyred soldiers in the war.
Let us do something on this occasion so that our armed forces get the strength.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on December 5th is the World Soil Day.
I would like to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
An important part of the earth is soil.
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire food is connected to the soil.
If there is no land or plantation, then how could human life be possible
The reason for this is the reason why we have been aware of the importance of our land in our culture very long ago.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a simple effort to live in the fields, towards soil, devotion and respect, on the other hand, the scientific methods of nutrition of this land have been a part of our lives.
It has been important in the lives of the farmers of the country, in which the devotion to their land and the land is being conserved scientificly.
I heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj Taluka in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Earlier, the farmers used half of the chemical fertilizers, fertilizers and due to this, their land health worsened.
The yields were decreasing and resulting in reduction in income and the productivity of land was also gradually decreasing.
Some of the farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and then the farmers tested their land from time to time. The more fertilizers, fertilizers, micro-nutrients and live fertilizers they were asked to use, the more they were advised to use.
You will also be surprised to hear the results that what was the result of the demands given to the farmers through soil health and the guidance given to them
In the year 2016-17, the production of wheat has increased three to four times per annum to these farmers.
Our farmers across the country have made more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and can also cultivate inappropriate crops.
We worship Mother Earth, but how big we harm the health of Mother Earth with chemical fertilizers like urea
All kinds of scientific experiments have proved that giving urea to Mother Earth more than required causes serious damage.
Today is the demand for awakening this relationship of mothers and daughters once again.
Can our farmers, our sons and sons of our land make a pledge that when they use urea today, when it will be 5 years of independence in 2022, they will make it half of it
How is the change in the lives of the farmers
We all are beginning to experience global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the cold started before Diwali.
Today, the 12th of December is screaming and the cold is still increasing gradually.
But as the cold starts, we all feel that it does not like to get out of the holiday.
However, in such a season, people who are constantly aware can bring beautiful results and that example is inspiring for all of us.
Tushar has done inspirational work in spreading the message of cleanliness.
It shows that there is no age of cleanliness or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for everyone.
And for sanitation, everybody needs to be cooked.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are committed.
At a moment, we can learn something or the other.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is a field of sports or a competition or a social initiative, our Divyangjans are not behind anyone.
You will remember that our Divyang sportspersons had won four medals by performing beautifully at Rio Olympics and had also made a champion in the Blind T T Twenty Cricket World Cup.
There are several competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won the Gold in the 01st National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 paralysis competition.
He is one of the 32 Para-Taranviro who will be trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the zeal of brother Jigar Thakkar and wish him my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being given to use and opportunities for Divyangjans.
It is our endeavour to empower every person of the country.
Increase harmony in the society and move forward with the spirit of equality and mom.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the countrymen and hope that this festival of Eid inspires all of us to enhance peace and harmony in society.
Forget grief, and do not let happiness forget.
I think we should propagate this.
We are trying to recall many interesting events of the last year in the broadcast media.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember others inspiring occasions.
If I recall the good things, the feeling of doing well will awaken, the mood will become.
Good things, provide energy to improve.
And I will try to bring the details of your positive India on Hashtag Positive India to the countrymen in the next Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will be amongst you again for the next month's Mann Ki Baat.
There will be a lot of opportunity to talk.
All India Radio on 2nd October, 2017
Celebrated six days after Diwali, the Maha Parv Chhath is one of the most celebrated festivals in our country with rules and integrity.
In which traditional regulations are followed in every matter from food to dress.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is fully linked to nature and the supplication of nature.
The sun and water are at the centre of the prayer of the Maha Parva Chhath, the utensils made of bamboo and mud and the kandumula are the integral materials associated with its puja.
The message of the worship of the rising sun and the setting sun in this great festival is full of unique culture.
The important expression of cleanliness in our lives is also included in this festival.
Prior to Chhath, along with the cleaning of the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, ponds, ponds, ponds, puja sites, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Normally people understand the inferiority of taking something, but in Chhath Puja there is a special tradition of eating prasad demanding after the morning half of the morning.
Behind this tradition of asking for prasad, it has also been shown that it destroys the ego.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be appreciated and criticised.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with a hundred per cent unbreakable relationship with the people of this country.
Take the example of khadi and handicrafts.
On Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been admiring for handlooms, khadi and what is the result of this
You must have been happy to hear that Khadi and Handicrafts are being sold on the same store.
The sale of Khadi Gift Coopens during Diwali has increased by about 680.
Overall sales of khadi and handicrafts have grown by about 0 percent this year over the previous year.
It shows that today, the youth, the elderly, the women of every adult like khadi and handicraft.
I can imagine how many weaving families, poor families and families working on handlooms would have benefitted from this.
In the lives of the poorest of the poor, handlooms are standing up as a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for the village people.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi app that he wants to know about my Diwali experience with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces consider Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwade has also written on the Narendra Modi App, why can our house be arranged to reach the sweet security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that our household sweets should reach the people of the country.
You must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
Deepawali has brought me a special experience this time too.
Once again I got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with our armed forces on the border.
This time it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gurej sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every soldier of our security forces on behalf of every countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces protects the country by dealing with the difficult and odd situations on the border.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their pride.
Many of us don't know that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our borders but also in the world.
Being a UN Peace Ambassador, he is renowning the name of India in the world.
In the past, on 24th October, UN Day was celebrated worldwide.
Everybody remembers the UNs efforts and its positive role in establishing peace in the world.
And we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
And because of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important UN initiatives since its inception.
You must be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins only with the words of the WE THE PEOPLE.
India has always stressed on female equality and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living testimony.
All men are born free and equivalent, which was replaced by the efforts of Indias representative Hansa Mahtta and later accepted, All human beings are born free and equivalent.
Though this is a very small change, a healthy idea is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who will be getting this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served them in the UN Peacekeeping Operations.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PECEKEEPING Initives and are the third largest figures in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served nearly 50 Operators from the UN Peacekeeping Operating Operators worldwide.
This OPERATIONS runs in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, worldwide.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated in the Indian Army Hospital in Kong and South Sudan and innumerable people have been rescued.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by making people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peacekeeping.
Very few people would be aware that India was the first country to send the Women's Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Mission in Liberia.
And look, this step of India has become a source of inspiration for countries around the world.
And then all the countries started sending their women's police unit.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not confined to peacekeeping operations but also to train the peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
Our security forces have to go and work in remote areas.
We have to live among different people.
Different circumstances and different cultures have to be known.
They have to slope themselves according to the local requirements and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper and was a brave man who was honoured with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeepers who have established a special identity in Cyprus.
At the age of two years in 1988, he was made the Force Commander for Operation in Namibia and provided his services to ensure the independence of the country.
General Thimayya, who has also been the chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and humiliated himself for peaceful work.
India has always been conveying the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as a messenger of peace.
We believe that everybody lives with peace, harmony and moves forward in the direction of building a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land is decorated with such great people who have served humanity with selfless passion.
Sister essay, whom we call Bhagini essay, was also one of the extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda gave him the name of his statement.
And the essay means that it is fully dedicated.
He later proved himself in accordance with his name.
Yesterday, the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sister Statement was.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happy life and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister's statement was very sad about the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us a slave mentally.
This work was going on continuously by showing down our culture and creating inferior feelings in us.
Bhagini Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to unite people by awakening national consciousness.
He went to different countries of the world and raised his voice against the evil propaganda about eternal religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Penn, New Women and Womens Empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was Bhagini's vacation.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
He helped in publication and propagation of Basu research through his writings and conferences.
This is the special beauty of India that spirituality and science in our culture are complementary to each other.
Bhagini's release and scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu is a strong example of this.
In 1988, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in a glimpse.
Bhagini's release started the work of cleaning the naek and roads without worrying about her health.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, the people looked at him in service.
He taught people the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
And it is written on his tomb - Here Reposes Sister Nivedita who has given him all to India - who has dedicated his universal India here.
Undoubtedly, he did the same.
Today, for this great personality, he cannot have a better homage than that, that every Indian should try to walk on that service path by taking inspiration from his life.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day, celebrated on the birth anniversary of our first elder Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehruji.
Children are the most important heroes of building a New India.
Your concern is true that the diseases that used to come in old age and the last stages of life are now visible in children as well.
Today it is very surprising when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases were lucky in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the major reasons for this kind of disease in youth is the deficiency in physical activities in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this.
When they think about it, you see that there is no need to specify anything.
It is just necessary to make it a habit of changing your habits by actually doing small things, regularly.
I would like the family members to try to adopt the habit of going to the open grounds.
If possible, we should also play with the elders of the family in the open.
Instead of coming up in the elevator, get the habit of climbing the stairs.
After dinner the whole family walks a little with the children .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorder.
30 minutes of yoga before going to school, see how much benefits are there.
You can do the same at home and the speciality of yoga is the same - it is easy, it is easy, it is all-available and I am simple because any adult person can do it easily.
Several researches are underway to know how effective yoga is in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very encouraging.
We should not only make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of our lives as a medium of treatment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the field of sports in the past.
Our sportspersons have named our country in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey by playing a glorious game.
Our sportspersons have performed excellently and India has become the Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, India became the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and the helper staff on behalf of me and on behalf of the countrymen.
After Hockey, good news has also come to India in Badminton.
Badmint star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open by performing excellent performance and has created a feeling of pride in every Indian.
This is his third Super Series Premier Khitab after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for their achievement and for enhancing Indias pride.
Friends, FIFA Under-1 World Cup was organized this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their greetings on football grounds.
I also got the opportunity to go to a stage.
Sportspersons and audiences were very enthusiastic.
Such a big occasion of the World Cup, the whole world is watching you...
I was shocked to see the spirit of showing the energy, enthusiasm and enthusiasm of all the young players.
The World Cup was successfully organised and all the teams performed their best.
Though India could not win, the young sportspersons of India won the hearts of all.
The entire world, including India, accepted this festival of sports and the entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
Football's future is very bright and its signs are visible.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, as many as I write about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of justifying with their feelings then I will have to make a programme of Mann Ki Baat everyday and everyday I will have to dedicate Mann Ki Baat to cleanliness.
Somebody sends the gates of the efforts of mistakes, somewhere there is a case of collective efforts of the youth.
Somewhere there is a talk of innovation about cleanliness or the changes caused by the people of an officer.
In the past, I have received a very detailed report, in which there is a matter of change in the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra.
The entire team of NGOs called the Economic Protection Organization launched a campaign for cleaning the Chandrapur Fort.
He sent me a portrait of the fort before and after cleanliness.
I was stunned to see the photographs and those who saw these photographs also feel disappointed by seeing the dirt around me, sometimes they feel that how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled, I would tell them that you can see the youth of the ICPO, their sweat, their zeal and their determination in the live pictures.
Your disappointment will be turned into faith as soon as you see it.
This Bhagirath effort of cleanliness is a unique example of beauty, collectiveness and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
It is the responsibility of our fellow citizens to keep historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate the Economic Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and described all castes as equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Devji travelled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and gave a message of true humanity during his journey.
He interacted with the people, showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and devotion.
He gave a message of equality in the society and showed this message not only with words but with his work.
He driven anchor, which led to a sense of service among the people.
The spirit of unity and equality among the people was awakened by sitting and taking anchor.
Guru Nanak Devji gave three messages of meaningful life - name God, work hard, help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had also constructed Gurbani to speak his words.
In the next year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th light year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Let us try to move forward on the path of their messages and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later, on 31st October we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji.
We all know that he had laid the foundation stone of modern integral India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great son of Mother India.
Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world on 31st October.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he not only used to give transformative thoughts but also experts in finding a practical solution to a very complex problem to show it.
He had a difference in realising the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took the pleasure of binding India at one point.
He ensured that crores of Indians are brought under the umbrella of One Nation and One Constitution.
His decision-making capabilities enabled him to overcome all obstacles.
Wherever there was a need for generosity, he saluted and used force where there was a need for energy.
He said that no distinction between caste and religion can stop us, there are daughters and daughters of all India, we all should love our country and build our policy on mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant for our vision of New India.
And this is the reason why his birthday is celebrated as the National Unity Day.
His contribution to the nation as a unbreakable nation is incomparable.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, Run for Unity will be organized across the country on 31st October, which will include children, youth, women and people of all age groups from across the country.
My urge to all of you to participate in the Run for Unity festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new determination, with a new determination, you people will once again be associated with your daily life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you all.
Three years since Mann Ki Baat has been completed through Akashwani, today it is 36 mode of episode.
And when I talk about Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can tell you very few things but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Many of them are for reform in the government.
Sometimes there are personal complaints and sometimes attention is drawn to the collective problem.
And I take half an hour for you once in a month, but people reach Mann Ki Baat on thirty-three days.
And the result of this is that the sensitivity of the government and the powers of the far-flung society are being taken care of.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity I have got to know the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
And I am confident that this discussion will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will get a new consciousness and new energy.
Once I had said Mann Ki Baat that we should worry at the time of lunch that we should take as much as we need, we should not ruin it.
But after that I have seen that I have received so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organizations and many youngsters have been doing this work beforehand.
Many people who worked on the smooth utilisation of the food plate which was left in the plateau, were very satisfied and very happy.
And then I saw that many people came forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the selfie with Daughter of a Sarpanch of Haryana and I spoke to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
A big campaign was launched not only in India but also in the whole world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
This is a new self-confidence and a new pride in every daughter.
Every parents felt that I would also take selfies with my daughter.
Every daughter started feeling that I have some greatness, I have some importance.
In the past, I had a meeting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
When I told the visitors that wherever you go, send a photograph on Incredible India.
Millions of images of every corner of India, in a way, have become a huge trust for the people working in the tourism sector.
I have experienced in Mann Ki Baat that how big the event starts.
Today, it was decided to say all these things because when I was thinking that three years have passed, many incidents of the last three years have come to my mind.
The country is constantly moving forward in the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of others, for the good of the society and for the progress of the country, I have learnt, understood and learned from the countrymen in my three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
This is a huge capital for any country and has a great power.
I salute the people of the country with my heart.
Be it sheets, towels, curtains, the feeling that the attraction of Khadi has increased in the younger generation.
The sale of fertilizers has increased and this has led to direct employment linkages in the houses of the poor.
Discounts are given in Khadi from 2nd October and many are exempted.
I would once again urge you to move ahead and enhance the khadi mission.
Let us work with this feeling that we will buy khadi and light the lamps of Diwali in the poor house.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And due to the increase in interest in this khadi, the fertilizer sector has also enhanced the zeal of thinking in a new way among the people of Khadi in the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase manufacturing capacity, how to bring solar handicrafts
How to revive the old legacy which was completely closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years.
In Varanasi Sevapur, Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several types of activities have been linked.
Many people were created new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir resumed its closed training centre and Kashmir has a lot to provide it in this area.
Now due to the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be able to get aid in the construction of modern forms, in the construction of new things and I am very happy that when big corporate houses are giving gifts to Deepawali then now fertilizers are being given.
People have also started providing fertilizers as gifts to each other.
We all realize how things move forward with a comfortable feeling.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, all of us had made a resolution and we had decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti will celebrate the festival of cleanliness across the country.
I will connect the people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President ji started this work and joined the country.
Children, adults, men, women, cities or villages, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness campaign today.
And when I say that how Sankalp to Siddhi, this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward towards a Sankalp Siddhi, we are seeing it before our eyes.
Everybody accepts it, supports it, and contributes something or the other to realize it.
This time there is one thing that we should clean up somewhere, the other is that we should not be aware and dirty, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then a ideological movement is also necessary.
This time many competitions were held with Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the sanitation prevention competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness comes, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see how much of our country's electronic media can serve the country in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Just a few days ago, somebody noticed me about the 18-year-old young Bill Dar of Srinagar.
And you will be happy to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has built Bill Dar for cleanliness and when it comes to Brand Ambassador, you will feel that he would probably be a cinema artist, perhaps he would be a diamond of the sports world.
Bill Dar himself has been engaged in cleanliness for the last 5-6 years from the age of 12-13 years .
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar where it is plastic, polythene, use bottle, waste and waste.
He also earns a little of them.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age but he also linked his life with cleanliness.
I would like to congratulate Srinagar Nagar Corporation for this initiative towards cleanliness and for his imagination about Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and it is a big thing to get so much strength for cleanliness.
And I am glad that they have not only made Bill a brand ambassador but also the corporation has given a car to cleaning bill this time and they are educating people by visiting other areas, inspiring people for cleanliness and fall behind till the result is brought.
Bill Dar is a young age but is a cause of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month for us to remember many great men.
These dignitaries gave us direction for the 20th century and the 21st century, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country.
On 2nd October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji, on 11th October is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and on 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
Nanaji and Deendayal ji also have this centenary year.
And what was the center point of all these great men
One thing in his life was normal and that was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not only teachings but also to guide people through his conduct in his life.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakash ji, Deendayal ji, all these are the great men who stayed away from the shares of power but lived for a long time with the lives of the people and continued to do something or the other.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left his political life in the village and today when we are celebrating his centenary year, it is very natural to be respected for his village work.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji used to talk to the youth, Nanaji always used to talk about the rural development of Deshmukh.
He used to mention with great respect and himself went to the village to see this work of Nanaji.
Remembering all these great men is not a compassion for them. We remember these great men so that we can get the path ahead and get the direction ahead.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the Run for Unity is scheduled to be held across the country.
Run for Unity programmes should be organized in every city of the country, in every city of the country and this season also enjoys running and it is also important to achieve iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also move ahead with the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say very naturally - unity in diversity, the speciality of India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will repeatedly tell my countrymen of India and especially to my younger generation that we are in a aware state.
Let us experience the diversity of India, touch them, let us feel their fragrance.
You see, these diversities of our country also work as a big school for the development of your personality.
There is a vaccine, the days of Diwali, there is a habit of visiting everywhere in our country, people go as travellers and it is very natural.
But sometimes it is a matter of concern that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, we do not understand it but we have started traveling abroad by coming under the influence of Jhakjamal.
You go anywhere in the world, I have no bonds but sometimes look at your home too.
The person of North India would not know what is in South India
The person of western India would not know what is in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
All these great men visited India widely.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
He tried to live India within himself.
Can we try to learn and learn different states of our country, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their dress, their food and their beliefs as a student
The value addiction in tourism will take place only when we not only visit but as a student, we try to celebrate them.
I have experienced that I have got the opportunity to visit more than five hundred districts of India.
More than four and a half districts will be such that where I have the opportunity to get a night break and today when I am taking charge of this responsibility in India, I have the experience of this tour.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to experience the immense strength of our vast India while speaking the words of unity in diversity.
This includes the dream of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
There is a diversity of food habits .
Even if you keep eating a different food everyday, no food will ever be repeated.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
Encourage the diversity of the people of Kotikoti.
With these experiences, your life will be prosperous.
The scope of your thinking will become vast.
And who can be a greater teacher than experience
Normally the period from October to March is mostly tourism .
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will further enhance my mission.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share your pictures.
Definitely send your photo on Incredible India.
If you want to meet the people not only of the buildings but also send their photographs.
Write not only about natural beauty but also some of the people there.
Write good restrictions for your journey.
If possible, it should go to seven places.
Can you give any information about that
You see, if all the people of one state say about this, then I will tell the government that they should realise it and prepare the preaching literature on the seven common things that have come about every state.
That is, in a way, my aim is to encourage the tourist destinations with the objectives of the people.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also play an encouraging role in enhancing the tourism of the country using this period from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch me too.
It makes my heart a movement.
I have a deep impact on my mind.
In the end, I am also a man like you.
There is an event of last days which may have been noticed by you and we have seen a unique example of women's power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has grown in this young age then how will their mind be :
For 11 months, he worked hard and trained and dedicated his life to fulfill his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband Makesh Dubey worked as a hero in the army and died for the motherland.
His wife Nidhi also decided in the mind and he also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to be respected for our mother-in-law and our heroes.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
He has created a new inspiration, a new consciousness for the Koti-Koti people of the country.
Congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and Diwali also have a huge opportunity for the youth of our country.
We are organizing the World Cup of FIFA Under-1.
I am confident that football will be displayed all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
There should not be any school and college ground in India where our youngsters do not sports.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the entire world is going to play on the soil of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri is going on.
It is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire environment is covered with sacred aroma.
The atmosphere of spirituality all around, the atmosphere of festival, the atmosphere of devotion and this festival is considered to be the festival of power.
He is known as Sharadiya Navaratri.
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the people of the country and pray to Maa Shakti that our country attains new heights for fulfilling the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the ability to face every challenge.
When the country progresses at a rapid pace and when 75 years of Indias independence are being completed in 2022, then the efforts to fulfill the dreams of the people who are swinging for independence should be the resolve of those hundred and fifty crore people, we should come out by making a five-year rod map to realise that resolution.
My best wishes to all of you.
Festivals should also be celebrated and encouraged.
Mann Ki August 2019
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals, on the other hand, when it comes to know of violence from any corner of India, it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who gives full strength to the unity of the country.
Our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence and equal respect for centuries.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it from childhood, we have been saying it.
I had also said on the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, be it communal faith, be it faith in political ideals, be it faith in the person, be it faith in the tradition.
In the Constitution that Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us, every person has every kind of arrangement to get justice.
I would like to assure the people of the country that the law takers, those who have lost their lives for violence, whether it is a person or a group, this country will never tolerate and will never tolerate any government.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, determine the responsibilities of the law and will be punished by the guilty.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and clothing.
We see diversity in every behavior of life.
Our festivals are also full of diversity and because of our cultural heritage of thousands of years old, we need cultural traditions, social traditions, historical traditions, if we see, there will be perhaps a day of 365 days which we do not connect with any festival there.
Now it must have been noted that every festival of ours is going on according to the timelines of nature.
It has a direct relationship with nature.
Our rich festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today, I am talking about festivals, first of all I would like to call you Michhami Dukdam.
Yesterday the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in the Jain society.
Poshan festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava in the Jain society.
The last day of the Parushan festival is the day of the festival.
This is really a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is also called the Akshama-Vani festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michhami Dukkadam.
In his drama The Merchant of Venice, Senkespeare has written that "Mercy is a double blest, it blesses him that gives and he who forgives and whom he forgives, both gets the blessings of God.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak had given birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago, he became a symbol of the freedom movement.
And since independence, he became a symbol of awakening social teaching and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi continues for 10 days.
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity.
My best wishes to every countrymen on Ganesh Chaturthi.
Recently, the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society and gives a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the cause of attraction for tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that just like the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this direction.
After a few days in the category of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to every countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us but we also have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and hygiene are connected in family life.
Cleanliness is the vote for the preparation of festivals.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to become a social nature.
Publicly urges cleanliness to be an integral part of not only household but also in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, in our country, with these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you have, how much models your thought process is, a fresh work is being done to know that and that is how much you are aware of the environment.
If it is against it then it is considered bad in the society today.
And as a result of this, today I am seeing that in these days even in the Ganeshotsav eco-friendly Ganesha, as if a big campaign has started.
If you visit YouTube then children are making Ganesh ji in every household by bringing soil and making Ganesh ji.
Various types of experiments are being carried out in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Environment Conscience was seen in this Ganesh Festival which was fortunately seen before.
Media House is also training people, motivating and guiding people for large numbers of eco-friendly Ganesh statues.
And as I said, our country is full of crores and crores of bright minds.
And it looks very good when some new innovations are known.
Somebody told me that there is a gentleman who is an engineer himself, who collected soil in a special way, combinations it and traines people to make Ganesh ji.
And if there is immersion in water then it keeps water in one dollar so that it melts in water immediately.
Three years ago, when Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive results are being seen.
The coverage of toilets has reached about 6 percent from 3 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation.
A few days ago, there was a severe flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but after the floods, when the water decreased, so much dirt was spread everywhere.
At this time, the workers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera district of Banaskantha, Gujarat cleaned the 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by the flood.
Everyone sweated his sweat.
An excellent example of unity for cleanliness, an example of inspiration for everyone, was given by every worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind.
If the efforts made by dedication to cleanliness become our sustainable nature then how far can our country reach.
Whatever opportunity you get, whereever you get, we should find opportunities.
But we all join.
Work together on the day of the holiday or on Sunday .
Go to the neighbouring population, go to the nearby village, but do it as a movement.
In, a sector has been created where after construction of toilets, you can enter your name and the name of that family which you have helped.
My friends of social media can run a creative campaign and the work discussed in the Virtual World can become an inspiration to honour the ground.
This campaign of Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is a restricted competition for you, is a competition for making short films, painting competitions are being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and have no age limit, no age-limit.
You can make a short film, you can make it with your mobile.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be silent in any language.
The participants who will take part in this competition and whoever will get three choices, whoever will get three at district level, three at state level, they will be awarded.
So I invite everyone to join you in this form of this campaign of cleanliness.
I would like to say once again that this time, pledge to celebrate the 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti as a clean 2nd October, and for this, from 15th September, bring the mantra of cleanliness to the household.
Definitely take some or the other steps for cleanliness.
Make yourself a participant by working hard.
You see how this will shine on 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti.
You can imagine that after this 15-day hygiene campaign, after the same service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, we will have a sacred joy within us to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I would like to accept the loans of all of you especially today.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depth of the heart, not that you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I would like to express my gratitude and accept the loan because lakhs of people from every corner of the country get associated with this programme Mann Ki Baat.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people sometimes write me letters, sometimes send messages, sometimes there is a message on phones, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I look forward to your messages more than you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't think we are wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my witnesses.
He always tries to help the people but I am disturbed about one of their habits.
I once went to the mall to shop with him.
He spent Rs. 2000 for a sari comfortably and Rs. 450 for pizza and Rs. 450 for mall and the autorickshaw taken for a long time with the rickshaw holders for a long time.
While returning, we bought vegetables from the road and saved four-five rupees on every vegetable again.
I felt very bad.
We pay big bills without asking once and fight for a few rupees with our labourer brothers and sisters.
Do you not think that when we come around our house to sell some goods, some ferry applies, some small shopkeeper or vegetable seller or some auto rickshaw seller, whenever we come in contact with the people who work hard and work hard, we start emotionalizing with it - no, no less than two rupees, less than five rupees.
And whenever we go to eat in a big restaurant, we do not even see what it has been written in the bill and we will immediately extract the money.
Not only this, we go to buy saris in the shawls, we do not have any feelings but we cannot live without intercourse with any poor person.
Have we ever thought of what happens in the minds of the poor
The question for this is not of two-five rupees, it feels sorry that you are a poor person, so you have doubted his honesty.
There is no difference in your life for more than two-five rupees, but have you ever thought that this small habit would have hurt his mind
Madam, I am grateful to you. I have given me a message by calling you a phone call to touch your heart.
I am confident that if my countrymen also have a habit of treating the poor then they will definitely leave it.
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates the day of August 2 as the National Sports Day.
This day is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unprecedented.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to connect with sports.
Sports is part of our lives.
If we are counted among the young countries of the world, our youth should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality advancement, I understand what more than this .
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart mixing.
The youth of our country move forward in sports and today in the computer age, I also want to warn that the playing field is even more important than that place.
FIFA plays on the computer but sometimes in the field outside also show up with football.
Crickets will be played on the computer but in the open fields the joy of playing cricket below the sky is somewhat special.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out, the mother used to ask that when will they come back
Today the situation is such that when children come home, they start watching cartoon films in one corner or get stuck on mobile games and then they have to say that when will you go out
It is a matter of time and it was also a time when the mother used to tell the child that when will he come and today it is a situation that the mother has to say that when will he go out
Young friends, Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal to explore and showcase sports talents where any child in the sports sector has a talent in the entire country can upload his biodeta or video on this portal.
Ministry of Sports will provide training to selected sportspersons.
Let us welcome our young guests who come from all over the world with this festival of sports, believe in sports and create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share with the countrymen that happened to me last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of very young age and some of these daughters are born in the Himalayas.
The six daughters of our country who have never had any connection with the sea, their enthusiasm and courage to inspire all of us.
These six daughters will be able to cross the sea with a small boat INS Tarini.
This campaign has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will travel around the world and return to India after several months.
Sometimes 40-40 days will be spent in water, sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water.
Our six daughters with courage among the waves of the sea, and this is going to be the first event in the world.
Who would be the Indian who would not be proud of our daughters
I salute the enthusiasm of these daughters and I have told them to share their experiences with the entire country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read every one of them surely because this is a courageous story, a self-conscious story, and I will be happy to bring the words of those daughters to you.
My best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate the Teachers Day.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji's birthday.
He was the President but used to present himself as a teacher for life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
Great scientist Albert Institution had said - It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
That is, creative feelings and enjoyment of knowledge amongst your students are the most important quality of a teacher.
This time when we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we all make a resolution together
And when we talk about change in our country, the way we remember the mother in the family, the same way we remember the teacher in the society.
Teachers have a big role in transformation.
In every teacher's life sometimes such incidents have emerged that their comfortable efforts would have succeeded in bringing about a change in the life of somebody.
If we collectively try, we will play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come on, let's take this mantra to transform.
"Namaste, Prime Minister ji, my name is Dr.
Annya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been the subject of discussions on pandits of economic world not only in India but all over the world.
On 28th August, 2014, the campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind.
Yesterday, on 28th August, the mission of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with it and have opened bank accounts.
This figure is even higher than the confusion of many countries in the world.
Today, I am extremely satisfied that my poor brother, who has been sitting on the last mile of the society within three years has become a part of the roots of the country's economy, his habits have changed, he has started switching into the bank, he has started saving money and he has been feeling the security of money.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in banks.
In a way, this savings of the poor are their strength in the coming days.
And those who have opened accounts with Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - Rs. 1, Rs.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when there was a crisis on the poor, the life of the moneylender of the family came to an end, he got two lakh rupees in a few days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, be it Dalits, tribals, women, neighbouring youngsters, be it youngsters, be it the intent of doing something on their own, crores and millions of youngsters got money from the banks without any guarantee and they themselves took steps.
Not only this, everyone has made a successful effort to provide employment to Ekad-Bay.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me due to Jan Dhan Yojana, due to insurance, the benefits of the common man due to the PM Mudra Yojana and many inspiring cases were faced.
Today, there is no time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that such cases are MyGov.
They can also inspire new generations by interviewing such people.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are having a very negative effect.
In the past few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Ishan Bharat, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural calamities due to extreme rains.
The flood affected areas are being thoroughly monitored.
Relief work is being done at a comprehensive level.
My cabinet colleagues are also reaching Rubru wherever possible.
The State Governments are also making a lot of efforts with the help of flood victims.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making a lot of efforts to help people in such a situation.
Be it the army personnel, the Air Force personnel, the National Disaster Relief Force, the NDRF, the paramilitary forces, all of them are connected to the people in serving the disaster victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very busy.
NDRF teams have been searched.
The Conventions have made disaster friends and have been trained to do and do not do anything during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and they have been taught to work in a distressful situation by creating a public organisation.
Gradually, we should also make such a nature that we should set up our activities according to the climate change so that we can avoid damage.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters related to GST have been received, so many phone calls have been received.
And still people are expressing happiness about GST and expressing their desires.
And I also hear you a phone call. Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I call you Nitu Garg from Gurgaon.
I have heard your Chartered Accountants Day speeches and have been very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was started in our country on the same date last month.
Can you tell me whether the results of the government were getting after a month or not
I would like to know your ideas about this.
And when a poor person writes a letter to me that due to GST, the prices of things needed for the poor are reduced, things are cheaper then I feel very satisfying and happy.
Recently, I was seeing the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the traffic of trucks has increased.
It takes less time to cut the distance.
Highways have been freed from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to the separation of separation, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector used to be used to maintain work and they had to make their innovative godowns in every state.
But GST which I call Good and Symple Tax.
It has actually had a very positive impact on our economy and had an impact in a short time.
The rapid transformation that has transformed into each other, new records have been made, has created a new confidence throughout the country.
And sometimes economists, management experts, technologists, Indias use of GST in the form of models will definitely present it to the world.
It will become a case study for many universities in the world.
All decisions have been taken together by the States and the Centre with consensus.
And this is the result that every government has the same priority that due to GST, there is no balloon on the plate of the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, to all the departments, to the employees of the Central and State Governments involved in this work.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new culture of honesty.
In a way, it is also a social reform campaign.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a big effort successful.
My countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
Since childhood, we have heard this thing and that is why the unbearable movement started on 1st August, 120.
The uit India Movement started on August 142, which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th - the country became independent.
In a way, in the month of August, several events related to the date of independence have been specially linked.
This year we are celebrating the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali gave the slogan of uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 142.
From 185 to 142, the way the countrymen continued to join, struggle, tolerate, it is our inspiration for India to build a history.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for Indias freedom movement.
This movement was determined to liberate the entire country from British rule.
This was the time when the Indian Lokmanas had become a part of the uit India movement in every corner of the country, whether it is a village or a village or a city, whether it is educated or educated, whether it is poor or immortal or everybody shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
People's anger was at its peak.
Millions of Indians on the hackles of Mahatma Gandhi were shaking their lives with the mantra of dying.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and sacrificed their books.
We had heard the bugle of independence.
Mahatma Gandhi called for the uit India Movement on 1st August, but all the big leaders were imprisoned by the British authority.
And that time was that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan played a leading role in the country as the leader of the second generation.
In the Unbearable Movement and the uit India Movement, there are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 1942.
The unbearable movement was different and the situation of the 42 was different, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of death.
This was a public support, a peoples capability behind all this success.
Lok Sankalp was a peoples struggle, the whole country was fighting as one.
Sometimes I think that if we see a few links of history then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1855.
The freedom struggle that started in 1855, continued in some corner of the country till 142.
For a long time, the people of the country have woken up the joy of freedom.
Everyone has become committed to doing something or the other.
Generations have changed, but there was no reduction in resolution.
The country has been making every effort to eradicate the British Sultanate.
This hard work from 185 to 142 created such a situation that it reached the peak in 1942 and the Ranshingu of uit India was blown up that in five years the British had to go to 14.
From 185 to 142, the five years of independence, from 142 to 14, became such a peoples age, with the success of five decisive years of Sankalp to Siddhi, the country became a cause of independence.
This was a five-year decisive year.
Now I want to connect you with this calculation.
We were free in 14th, today is 2019.
It has been about 70 years since, everybody has tried in his own way to make the country free from problems.
Likewise, there was a decisive five years of success from 142 to 14 resolutions.
I am seeing that from 2017 to 2022 - a five-year period from Sankalp to Siddhi has come to us.
We will celebrate this 15th August, 2019 as a Sankalp Festival and will be transforming this resolution into achieving it when it is 5 years of independence in 2022.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores and crores of resolutions.
So, just as the five years of 142-14 have become decisive for the country's independence, these five years can become decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, I will celebrate 5 years of independence.
Let us run a great campaign of Sankalp Se Siddhi in the month of August.
Every Indian, social institutions, local units, schools, colleges, different organisations should take some or the other pledge for every New India.
A resolution that we will prove in the coming five years.
I am specially on-line world today, because we are somewhere or not, but we are surely online.
I invite my young friends, especially my young friends who have an online world to come forward for their innovative contribution in the creation of a New India.
Using technology, videos, posts, blogs, writings, innovative ideas should be brought about.
May this humble be transformed into a mass movement.
uit India quiz for young friends will also be launched on the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to make them aware of the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must propagate it, spread it.
There he does not speak a single person, the voice of 125 crore people from the Red Fort echoes.
This time also I invite you. I must send your ideas on MYGOV or on the Narendra Modi app.
I read it myself and I will try to reveal the time I have on 15th August.
In the last three times, I got to hear a complaint in my speech on 15th August that my speech becomes a little longer.
We see whether success is available or not.
My countrymen, I would like to say one thing.
India has a socio-economics.
And we should never underestimate it.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just an occasion of joy and pleasure.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
Just a few days later, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesh Festival, then fourth moon, then Anant Chaudash, Durga Puja, Diwali is one after another and this is the right time when the poor get the opportunity to get economic upgradation.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of household households start making a hire in small household industries.
Hundreds of thousands of sweet-sweet-building businesses are connected to a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs through it.
We shine lamps in Diwali, not only this is the light festival but it is not just a festival, it is a decoration of the house.
Its direct relation is with the poor families who make small lamps of soil.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, the aware citizens of the environment have written letters to me.
And he has urged you to talk about the eco-friendly Ganesh in the fourth Ganesh Chaturthi so that people can plan from now on the choice of soil ganesh.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He urged me to speak on this subject prematurely.
This time Public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji had started this great tradition and this year is the 125th year of the public Ganeshotsav.
Once again, let us hold a ban on this year of Ganeshotsav, hold discussions, recall the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And how should we take the public Ganeshotsav in the direction of the feeling of Tilak Ji again, how should we strengthen this feeling and at the same time eco-friendly Ganesh and Ganesh made of soil for the protection of the environment.
And this time I have said very soon
I am sure you will connect with me and this will benefit the poor artists, poor artists and those who make idols, they will get employment and the poor will be filled with the stomach.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect with the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals become the economic festival of the poor's house and become economic joy. It should be an effort of all of us.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen for many festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we constantly see that our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, are attaining new heights, be it the field of education, be it economic sector or social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters.
Recently, our daughters have performed a grand performance in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those daughters this week.
I felt very good to talk to them but I was feeling that they could not win the World Cup.
He had pressure on his face and stress.
We have seen many such sports that if India sportspersons fail to fail then the country's anger breaks down on those players.
Some people break the limits and write something that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, 125 crore Indians took the defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters singed the quality of what they did, they glorified them.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are actually doing a lot to illuminate the name of the country.
I once again wish the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters with heart.
My dear countrymen, once again I remind you of the August Revolution, once again I remind you of the 15th August, once again I remind you of the 5 years of independence.
Every citizen of the country should make a five-year roadmap to realise the resolution.
We all have to bring the country to new heights, to reach and to reach.
Let us move together, let us do something.
The fortune and future of the country will continue to be better, it will move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant due to rain.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief from the heat that has fallen in the cold winds in the past.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, there are tensions, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath ji is considered to be very devotional and compassionate in many parts of the country.
Now the festival of Lord Jagannathji's Rath Yatra is celebrated in some parts of the world.
And the poor of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath Ji.
Those who have done Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar must have studied, he must have seen that he used to appreciate Lord Jagannathji's temple and his traditions because it contained social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannathji is the god of the poor.
And very few people would know that there is a word in English, uggernaut and it means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And it is also seen in the dictionary of this Jagannath that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has adopted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath ji's visit, I extend my greetings to every countrymen and salute Lord Jagannath ji in the feet of Lord Jagannath ji.
The diversity of India is also its specialty, the diversity of India which is also the strength of India.
People celebrated the holy month of Ramzan with a sacred spirit.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, my best wishes to everyone on behalf of me.
The month of Ramadan is the month of virtue.
It is a month to share happiness and as much happiness as we share.
Let us share the treasure of happiness with inspiration from these sacred festivals and move the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, a motivational incident of the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in a small village and in a way more distress is from our Muslim family brothers and sisters.
The people of the village have decided to build toilets in this Ramzan.
And individual toilets, assistance is also provided by the government and the amount of about 1 lakh rupees has been given to them.
1 lakh rupees will be spent for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this auspicious occasion of Ramzan into the occasion of the welfare of the society.
Their objects are also very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he freed Mubarakpur from open defecation.
We know that three regions in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF.
I am extremely grateful to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this work.
We know a lot that if we have to do something better in the life of a person and in the life of a society, we have to work hard.
If our letters are bad, if we want to improve it then we have to make an effort to remain very aware for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
The topic of cleanliness is the same.
Such bad habits have become part of our nature.
It has become a part of our habits.
We have to strive continuously to get rid of it.
Everybody's attention has to be attracted.
We have to remember good inspirational events.
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the past, a very good event came to me, which I would definitely like to tell you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration has taken a big task in public participation.
A 100-hour non-stop campaign.
And what was the goal
Ten thousand household toilets in 17 gram panchayats in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 villages have become ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in governance, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district for inspiring examples by reaching the hard work.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I continue to get a request from the people and keep on coming to the Narendra Modi App, my gov.
In, it keeps on coming from letters, it keeps coming to Akashwani.
Shri Prakash Tripathy recalled that on 25th June, he has presented it as a black period in the history of democracy.
This awareness towards the democracy of Prakash Tripathy is commendable and democracy is not just a system, it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June - it was a dark night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a jail.
The opposite voice was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were locked in jail.
The justice system could not escape from the shadow of that terrible form of crisis.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Today's journalists, students of the world, people working in democracy, repeatedly remind them of the dark age, constantly and constantly strive to enhance awareness about democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem when Katokti had a year and he described the condition of that time in his poetry.
We have to empower this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today is proud to raise his head in the world.
The entire world became Yoga Day on 21st June, 2017.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
When people practiced Yoga at the Great Wall of China in China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above sea level at the World Heritage Site Machu Pichu in Peru.
People performed yoga in Eiffel Tower Sandhya in France.
More than 4,000 people performed collective yoga in Abu Dhabi, UAE.
In Afghanistan, India in Hairat, Yoga on Afghanistan Friendship Dam - Salma Dam gave a new wait to India's friendship.
In small places like Singapore, programmes took place at 0 places and they launched the campaign for a week.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organized at the UN Headquarters.
UN officials, diplomats from all over the world participated in this...
This time again, Yoga has also worked as a world record.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to be present in the programme of Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing yoga in the rains.
Our soldiers have also done yoga in Siachen where the minus is 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Be it our Armed Forces, BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, everybody has made Yoga a part of its duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share the photographs of Yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried forward this thing.
I got several photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi app.
"Mr. Honble Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that recently we had heard in your speech in Kerala that instead of giving gifts and flowers, we should give good reading books as mementoes.
You have started this work in Gujarat even during your tenure, but we are not able to see that work in a few days.
So can we do this
The reading day and reading month are celebrated for people to get the habit of reading books, to make people aware about reading books.
That is why I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And the handicraft of Khadi, which will also encourage the fertilizers.
As long as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become the same habit but after coming here I had left my habit.
But when he went to Kerala, he remembered it once again.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions to the government.
We can gradually become a habit.
And the guldasta of flowers is very small.
Once we took it in hand, then we put it in hand.
But if we give the book then it becomes a part of the house, it becomes a part of the family.
Welcoming Khadi towels, how many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure is also reduced and it is also used in the right sense.
And when I am telling this thing, how historical is the value of such things.
When I went to the UK last year, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth, invited me for food in London.
Even though many years have passed, Rani Elizabeth has kept that towel given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching, he was urging me to touch it.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I believe that the habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it, we also have to become a victim of criticism.
However, there will be vaccines but if I keep talking then there will be a change gradually.
My beloved countrymen and Prime Ministers have a lot of work.
I have to stay in the files but I have a habit for me that I read some of the letters I get from every day and that gives me a chance to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of letters come, different kinds of people write letters.
These days I got the opportunity to read a letter and I feel that I must tell you about it.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife of Madurai, Arulmoji Sarvanan, sent me a letter.
And in a letter, he wrote that in my family, I thought in the direction of some economic activity along with paying attention to the study of children, which would provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took money from the bank through the MUDRA scheme and started a small task in the direction of delivering some luggage from the market.
I have noticed that the Government of India has a system called Surveyment e-Marketplace.
So I discovered the information about what it was, I asked the people about it.
Then I myself got registered in it.
I would like to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity, then you will also visit e-GeM on the Internet.
Those people who want to send a supplies to the government, want to send small things, send electricity bulbs, send dustbins, send savarnis, send a chair, send a table, sell it, they can register their name in that site.
And the people of the government departments will have to visit the site even when they are compulsory, they will have to see who does not bind in the quality of suppliers without binding them.
And then they have to order.
So, every department of the government sees those who register their names within the e-GeM.
Because of lack of intermediaries, things are very cheap.
Now this uncomfortable madam has registered all the goods that were able to provide on this website of the government.
And the funny thing is that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got money from the mudra, my business started, I have given all the information that I can give within the e-GeM and what I might have been invited from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is the Government e-Marketplace GeM.
I would like those people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way to add more and more to this site.
I believe that this is a wonderful example of Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance (minimum to Minimum Government Maximum Governance) and what is its goal at least cost and efficiency and transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground connected with Yoga then our dreams are to cross the horizons of the sky far and wide.
A few days ago, India has done a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched a 30-nation satellite with Cartosat-2 series satellite.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America, besides India.
And this nano satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of farmers and in the field of natural disasters.
A few days ago, all of us would have remembered that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-1.
And the satellite that India has launched so far is the highest weighted satellite.
And if the newspapers of our country compared with the weight of their elephants then you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the space sector.
On 1st June, one thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed.
But I am happy that the efforts of our scientists had the power to complete six months successfully and now our Mangalyaan Mission is working even after a thousand days.
Photos are being sent, giving information, sanitfic data is coming, it is working more than its age.
The completion of a thousand days is an important step in our scientific journey and our space journey.
We are also seeing the interest of our youth in the field of sports.
Now it is being seen that along with studies, our younger generation is showing their future in sports and because of our sportspersons, their hard work and their achievements, the country's name is also illuminated.
Recently, India has enhanced the dignity of the country by encouraging its victory in the Indonesia Open by bedminton player Kidambi Srikanth.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
I got the opportunity to be present at the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics, Ushaji.
Sports plays a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is very big in the entire personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family too, they should be given an opportunity to play.
They should not be compelled to study and study by raising them from the fields, by shutting them down in the rooms, by shutting them down for books, but if they have the capability and interest in sports, then everybody should be encouraged and encouraged.
Everybody should dream for todays Olympics.
Once again, my loved countrymen, the atmosphere of rains and festivals, in a way the feeling of this period is new.
We will never forget the heat of this year.
Rainfall is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, on this holy month.
Prayer, spirituality and donation are given great importance in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have created such a tradition that today India can be proud of the fact that we can proudly proud that all the communities of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also live and those who reject God also live, those who worship the idol and those who oppose the idol worship also live.
Every kind of ideologies, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together and in the end, be it religion, sect, ideology, tradition, it gives us the same message of peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will surely help in furthering this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
When I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and especially told the youngsters to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
This is the age when life can be lived in such a way, you can take a little risk, you can invite problems.
I am happy that many people have given me a talent.
Everyone showed the enthusiasm to speak to me personally.
Some learn drama and some people have written that we have started writing poems.
My reading habit was almost left.
Therefore, I decided to read in these vacations.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be made to make India free, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to todays generation in this regard.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men who spent their youth in prisons, many young people laughed and laughed.
He tolerated so many accusations and that is why we are breathing in independent India today.
One thing we must have seen that the great men who spent time in the jails have done a great job of writing, studying, and their works have enhanced the freedom of India.
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote the book Maji Janmathe in jail.
He used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small coat.
Those who want freedom, think about how they must have commuted.
When I read Savarkar ji's book Maji Janmathe, I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail from it.
There is also a light and sound show that is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India that there would be no language speakers of India who did not suffer from their youth in this cellular jail, in the jail of Andaman for independence, in the jail of black water.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, the people of every language, the people of every region and every generation of the British.
I would definitely tell the young generation of the country that for the freedom we have got, how many adversities people had to face, how many adversities they had to face, if we go to the Cellular Jail then we will know.
If you get the opportunity, you should definitely go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle in a way.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with Nature means nurturing a better planet.
And who can say this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - one most care about a world one will not see.
That is, the world we do not want, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also take care of it.
If you are very tired and open the windows of the room, open the door, fill the fresh air in the breath then a new consciousness comes.
When the Panch Mahabhutas are in touch with that Panch Mahabhuta, the self-respect of a new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy appears.
This experience has been done by all of us but we don't know that we don't add it to one point, one point.
After this, you must see that when you are in touch with the natural condition, there will be a new consciousness in you, and therefore, the global campaign to connect with nature on June 5 should also be made our own mission.
And we are getting some benefits from the environment protected by our ancestors.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is the biggest guiding book of the environment in a way and has been written thousands of years ago.
We say there - Mata Bhoomi: Sons Aham Prithviya: It is said in the Vedas that the purity in us is due to our earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we recall Lord Buddha, one thing is sure that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the recognition of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana, the three trees were underneath.
But we need to connect it with modern logic in modern words.
These days, I keep getting news from the States.
In almost every state, a big campaign for planting trees is going on as soon as the rains arrive.
Trees are planted in crores of rupees.
My dear countrymen, 21st June is now a day known for the world.
The whole world considers it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread across every corner, it is connecting people.
On the one hand, when many powers of dividing the world are showing their distorted faces, Yoga is a great gift to the world.
We have added the world to one point through Yoga.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
Today due to lifestyle, due to race and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is also happening in young people.
Yoga plays an important role in taking medicines and passing days, in such a situation, to lead a stress-free life.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga if you have to experience the journey under the health of your body, mind, body, thought and conduct.
Just two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related competitions.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and I am told that this time, on the third International Day of Yoga, three generations of one family should Yoga together.
Be it grandfather or younger, parents or daughter-daughter, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Yoga will get a new dimension if this kind of smooth combination will happen tomorrow, today and tomorrow.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we people had launched the Self with Doctor campaign and had a very interesting experience.
These three generations of yoga will definitely play a curiosity for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Start studying today.
I will continue to post something or the other related to yoga on a tweeter from 1st June and will continue to post till 21st June.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks continuously, spread it, connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive healthcare.
I invite you all to join it.
Because I had a very interesting phone call and I could not even think of it like this.
But I am grateful for the way he caught this thing.
You will also be noticed by this phone call.
Namaste Modi Ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your invitation.
The hustle-bustle that you had taken for cleanliness from the valley of Kashi has now taken your inspiration into a movement.
Your point is true that wherever I go, the government system works for cleanliness, but during these days there is also a festival of cleanliness in the society.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, ten days ago, several programmes of cleanliness are being organized.
Media also gives priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how much I would be happy to know that and how the country is taking care of these things in a beautiful manner.
During my journey, the topic of cleanliness is being linked, what could be more joyful for me
There will be other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness will be a major matter.
It is also pleasant and inspiring for any sanitation lover.
I extend my best wishes to all those who help in the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, the suggestion spreads a little rumour.
I don't know whether I can do it or not.
Modiji, whoever wants to invite you before visiting you, tell them that if you want to invite me, then what will be the level of cleanliness
I felt very good, but I have to think.
However, it is true that it should be started that it would be better to give other things as gifts that we should clean up so many tons of waste and give it in gifts.
We can prevent many people from getting illness.
How big will humanity work.
I would like to say one thing that we should not believe that the waste which is waste, this is a wealth and a source.
Do not look at it as a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a major mission of waste management with the help of State Governments as well as with the help of people representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, approximately 4,000 cities of the country are going to get access to solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of waste will be available, one green and the other blue.
Two types of waste erupts - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we stay in discipline, we put dry waste in blue waste and wet waste in green waste, such as waste from the kitchen, vegetable skins, waste food, egg skins, tree leaf etc.
This entire process is such that it can be used in the fields, the color of the fields is green and if you remember that the waste is to be put in the green waste.
And the rest of the wastes like silver papers, cardboards, iron, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken dustbins, rubber, metals and other filthy things - all these things are called a kind of dry waste, which have to be recycled by putting in the machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that Versova Beach, considered to be dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean Versova Beach today.
Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV) took over its full responsibility.
I congratulate Mr. Afroz Shah.
My best wishes to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region like a folk collection and transformed it into a mass movement, it is indeed an inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the last 15 days, for the month, whether it is print, television or social media, all these are constantly running the accounts of the present government for three years.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
This three-year term has been assessed on every cottage.
Every section of the society has reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe that governments should be responsible in democracy, people should be given account of their work.
For a aware nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of every good and bad thing falls on me as it is on the minds of a common man.
Some people also criticize it politically, but after such a long experience I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think that the Mann Ki Baat programme would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems like I am sitting in the middle of the family and talking about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
And as I said, it has an impact on my mind as a common man.
Two days ago in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Honble Vice President, Honble Speaker, everyone inaugurated the Mann Ki Baat, an analytic book, as a person, as a common citizen, this event is very encouraging for me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever you meet, there will be rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have to be started from the innovation and with the rains, there will be a new joyous atmosphere.
Let us all move forward in this environment by loveing nature.
I extend my best wishes to all of you.
Most of the informers who try to reach me are those who actually do something or the other in their lives.
And when this thing was taken into consideration, I felt that this suggestion was not normal, it was evident from the mood of experience.
I had never thought that today the youth of our country has been doing this work for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of some social institutions working for years but the youth of my country are engaged in it only after me.
Many have sent me widows.
There are many places where bread bank runs.
People deposit bread on their behalf in this bread bank, they deposit vegetables and they also get it from there.
Those who provide satisfaction are also satisfied and those who take it never have to look down.
This is an example of what work is done with the help of society.
Today the month of April is being completed, is the last day.
On the first day of May, Gujarat and Maharashtra are the foundation day.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have made constant efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when Climate Change was considered the subject of education, it was considered the subject of conservation, but today, we also experience it in our daily life and express it surprisingly.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The heat that falls in our country in May-June is a time to experience this time in March-April and when I was informing people about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me most suggestions on what should be done in this summer season.
Like the shoes, all the things are prevalent, it is not new, but whatever it is reminded of at that time is very useful.
Sh. Prashant Kumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
These friends have said that in the balcony, water should be placed on the roof and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very well.
Once he understands why this water should be filled, then he goes to see 10 times a day that the utensils that have water or not are kept in it and also the shoes that the bird has come or not.
We feel that this game is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience of the child's sensitivity.
You also see, you come a little along with animals and birds and feel a new joy.
In our country, we are coloured with the words of animals and birds and nature, but it is important to strengthen such efforts collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Saidna Saheb of Daudi Wahra society used to take hundred years.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He shared the texts of about 52 thousand grams of grams from all corners of the world.
It was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Record.
Sometimes we are so busy that sometimes we come to our courtyard with milk, vegetables, postals, but we forget that there are days of summer, first ask them for a little water.
Young friends, I would like to do some things with you too.
Sometimes I feel worried that our younger generation enjoys living in Asia-Ram.
Parents also maintain them in a defensive condition.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me the truth
If you use this time of vaccination according to my suggestion I suggest three of them, then it is a very good thing but try to implement one of the three.
That is the shoes or a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
You have never seen, you have not thought, you do not know, but if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on TV or reading it in the book or listening to it from the acquaintances and feeling the same thing itself, there is a difference between the two.
I would urge you to work hard to know the curiosity you have in this vaccine.
If the letters are positive, if they are out with a little comfort then also do it.
We belong to a middle class family and a happy family.
I don't say that do it again and again, feel it once.
Whether it is the time of the evening, take your football or take a ball or take any means of sports, reach the poorest of the poor.
You will get the pleasure of playing with those poor children, you will see that you have never met before.
And I am confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many Self-Service Organisations continue to serve.
Search on this thing that you are associated with Google Guru, connect with such an organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time, you must ever feel that if you have done such summer camps, you have learnt the course of personality development then you should reach those people who do not get the opportunity to participate in such camps and learn those people without taking the money you have learned.
You can teach them how to develop.
Everybody has become busy with technology.
Community is also a culture, collectiveness is a power.
Today is the time of competition.
Sometimes it feels afraid that our younger generation machines are not making human robots
Trying to spend time with yourself away from technology.
Be it Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
How many diverse countries are there and if we look at, we can find somebody in our surroundings.
You feel like learning car driving. Do you ever feel like learning auto rickshaws
You have driven a cycle, but you have taken a three-wheeled cycle, which carrys people.
You will see that all these new experiments, this skill is such that will enjoy you and that life which has been built in a diarrhoea from which it will also expel you.
Out of Box Do something, friends.
This is the only opportunity to create a life.
And you would be wondering that if all the examinations are completed, I will go to the new stage of Karkidhi then I will not be able to learn that opportunity.
Later, you will fall in other jerks and that is why I will tell you that if you want to learn magic then learn the magic of the leaf.
Keep showing magic to your fathers.
I say from my experience that seeing the world gets to learn and understand so much that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like to share my pictures when you are going.
Have you seen new
Where did you go
You share your experiences using Hyshtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you want to download BHIM app, you will also be using it.
But refer it to others.
And if a new person transacts three times, if a new person transacts three times, then you earn 10 rupees to do that.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get it done by 20 people in a day, you will earn 200 rupees in the evening.
Businesses can also earn, students can also earn.
And this scheme is up to 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a guard of New India.
So the vaccination of vaccination and earnings.
He had become a symbol of VIP culture in a way, but the experience says that the red light used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the car, but he used to drive into the mind and had made the VIP culture home in a mental way.
Just now the red light has gone, no one can claim that the red light that has snatched in the brain would have emerged.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, they have also expressed their apprehensions in that phone, but now this phone call shows that the common man does not like these things.
It feels that it is away from it.
Namaskar, Prime Minister ji, I am speaking from Shiva Choubey, Jabalpur from Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the red beacon flight ban of the government.
I read a line in Newspaper in which I had written, I was very proud to hear that every Indian is a VIP on a road and I was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I do not get stuck in traffic jams and I do not even have to stop for anyone.
So I would like to thank you for this decision.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that has been launched, our country is not cleaning up, the privacy of the VIP is also being cleaned on our roads, then thanks to the government's decision, it is part of the system.
But we have to get it out of our minds with an effort.
Together we will be able to get out if we will make an aware effort.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI will increase in place of VIP in the country.
And when I am telling EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear that every person is import.
Every individual has the importance, every individual has the greatness.
If we acknowledge the importance of the 125 crore countrymen, if we acknowledge the Mahatma, then all the great powers will be united to fulfil the great dreams.
We have to do so together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we keep reminding our history, our cultures, our traditions.
It gives us energy and inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya Ji, 125 crore Indians.
Because of some reason, we have become so small that we think more and more for centuries.
Centuries have a great importance for other countries of the world.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate the memories of thousands of years and even thousands of years ago.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that Ramanujacharya ji had a great fight against the evil that was done in the society, there was a feeling of untouchability, a feeling of casteism.
Through his conduct, the society had embraced those who believed to be untouchable.
Thousands of years ago, he had launched a movement to enter his temple and successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate we are that in every age a great man is born from our society to eradicate the evil of our society.
When we celebrate the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharyaji, we have the strength in the organization for social unity, take inspiration from him to awaken this feeling.
The Government of India is also going to celebrate a stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya ji on 1st May yesterday.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji with respect and respect.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is also a different significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
When Labourers are discussed then it is natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And very few people would know that today we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities that the workers get.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramanujacharya Ji, then the great saint and social reformer of the 12th century Karnataka, Jagat Guru Basveshwar ji also remembers.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to visit a function.
This was the occasion to dedicate the collections of his promise.
In other words, labour is a Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi Ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems that the world is passing through today, the competition of violence, war, destruction, weapons...
When we see this environment then the ideas of Buddha look very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey of Buddha from war.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated by the United Nations on this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This year he is going to be in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to refresh his memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my namaskaras to you people, the family members of everywhere in the country will be busy examining their children.
Those who have completed the examination will have a slight atmosphere there and the examinations are going on in those families will still have some concerns.
But at this time, I would like to say that at the time of the past, listen to what I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
At the time of the examination, the speaker will definitely work for you.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is the day of Bangladeshs independence.
A historic fight against injustice, an unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
On this important day, I extend my best wishes to the citizens and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh move forward, develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories are our joint heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize as well as the British gave him a Nighthood post.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh ji and his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru had been hanged by the British and we all know that the incident of 23rd March - the satisfaction of serving Maa Bharati on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were made in the sacrifice of Mother Bharati's independence.
And these three heroes are still inspired by all of us.
We cannot decorate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three youths.
The jails were closed, the hangings were fixed, but how to move forward along with it, the concerns of it were conscious of the British.
And only then it was to be hanged on 24th March, but it was released on 23rd March.
Fancy was stolen, which is not usually done.
And then the British had quietly burnt their body to Punjab today.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of wave on that earth.
And I would definitely tell the youngsters of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, whenever they go to Punjab, you must go to the place of the graveyard of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Datta.
This was the time when the widespreadness and intensity of freedom was increasing.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired many youngsters for the Armed Revolution and Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April 11 just a hundred years ago.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhijis ideology and Gandhis style were seen in Champaran for the first time.
This was a big turn in the entire movement of independence.
In particular, in the context of struggle, in this period, Champaran's Satyagraha, sports Satyagraha, millennium workers in Ahmedabad, all these were the impacts of Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and functioning.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and in 1917, he inspired the country by visiting a small village in Bihar.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a man who came back to India in 1915, just two years.
Neither the country knew them nor had their influence, nor was it the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to work at that time.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that Mahatma Gandhi's organisation Kaushalya, Mahatma Gandhi's nervous system of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour to unite, motivate and motivate the poorest and ethnic individuals in front of the British Sultanate with his behaviour.
And therefore, in this form we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think about Gandhi, Champaran Satyagraha Gandhi, a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who starts public life.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how to work on ourselves and how Gandhi did.
And this was the time when we heard the names of the big dignitaries, Gandhi had sent them all to the villages.
He taught the way people were working together and the way they were doing it with the color of freedom.
And the British couldn't understand what Gandhiji's methods and regulations are, struggles are also going on, creation is also going on and both walk together.
Gandhi had made a coin on both sides.
Conflict on one side of the coin and creation on the other side.
On the one hand, on the other hand, Homi Devi herself in constructive works.
There was a very unique balance in Gandhi's work style.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be unemployment, what is unemployment in front of such a great Sultanate, what is the word of Satyagraha, what is the word of unemployment.
The desire for this transformation, the efforts of this transformation, this is the same that will make a strong foundation for a New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor is it a political party election or a project.
It is a feeling that 125 crore Indians want to build a magnificent India.
There is a hope, a zeal, a resolution and a desire within the minds of the 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and see what is happening in the society with a sense of sensitivity, we will be surprised to know what is happening in our surroundings, then we will be surprised to know that lakhs of people are seen doing something for the society, for the exploited, the oppressed, the deprived, for the poor and the sad.
And he keeps on doing penance, penance, as a mask servant.
Many people go to the hospital everyday and help the patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood immediately .
There are many people who are hungry then worry about their food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Peoples service is the Lord's service, this mantra is in our blood.
If we see it once in the form of collectiveness, in an organized form, then we will know how big it is.
When we talk of a New India, it is very natural to see it with a different viewpoint and it is welcome in democracy.
But it is true that if one hundred and fifty crore people of the country decide the way for the resolution, one step after another, then the dream of New India-Sawas crore people of the country can be fulfilled in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all things should be done by budget, government projects or government funds.
If every citizen pledges that I follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen pledges that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full authenticity and dedication. If every citizen pledges that one day in a week, I do not use petrol and diesel in my life, how big change can happen.
It means that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows his duty.
That itself can become a good start of a New India.
My dear countrymen, I would also like to thank you today.
In the last few days, there has been an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people participated in the digital payments and digital movement.
The curiosity of transactions without cash has also increased.
The poor people are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving forward towards how to do business without cash.
Different modes of digital payments have seen significant growth since demonetisation and bankruptcy.
Even after the launch of BHIM App, only two and a half months has taken place but now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move ahead with the fight against black money and corruption. Can we pledge to do 2500 crore digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they want this work for the 125 crore countrymen, they do not have to wait for a year, they can do it in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if we have to pay the exit fees, we will not be filled with cash, we will be filled with digital, we have to travel in the railways, travel in the aircraft, we will make digital payments if we buy medicines, we will make digital payments, if we are running cheaper grain shops then we will make digital arrangements.
We can do these things in everyday life.
You cannot imagine but you can serve the country with this. You can become a brave soldier by fighting against black money and corruption.
In the past, several programmes of DGDhan Mela have been organized for public education.
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
There was also a prize scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have achieved this reward of the consumers.
0 thousand people have received the prizes for traders.
And everybody has made a pledge to move forward.
And many times, the DGDhan Mela is scheduled to be concluded on 14th April on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
After the completion of 100 days, one last very big programme is going to take place.
Various big droes have also been put in place.
I am confident that whatever time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary has been left with us, we should propagate the Bhim App.
Let us contribute to the less cash transactions, less cash transactions and less transactions.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time I seek suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat.
But I have seen that everybody has always been urging the people for the subject of cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you about my mind.
I would like to say that people have to understand how important cleanliness is.
I pass through a river every day in which people throw a lot of waste and pollut the river.
This river flows from the Rispna bridge to my house.
Several people have also spoken about it, but it has not benefited from it.
And the good thing is that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, suggesting me and also telling me that he has made several efforts but he has got success.
Awareness has come from the beginning of the Swachhta Movement.
Every person has been connecting it positively.
He has also taken the form of a movement.
hatred towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness, active participation, movement, all of them have their own importance.
But Swachhata is associated with the habits of movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can happen collectively.
The work is difficult but to do it.
I am confident that this feeling has awakened in the new generations of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth and this is a sign of a good result.
Today, I will tell all those people who are listening to Gayatri in my Mann Ki Baat programme that this message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
Since the beginning I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat from my Wahla countrymen, I have been getting a lot of information on one thing and most people have expressed concern about the waste of food.
We know that we take more food than required in the family and in the collective meal festivals.
Whatever thing we see is taken in the plate and they can not eat.
We cannot eat half of the plate filled with it and keep it there.
Have you ever thought how much harm we do with the food we leave.
Have you ever thought that if we do not waste food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people.
Despite some attempts, sadness on this subject is a social treachery.
Injustice to the poor.
I do not appeal much on this subject but I want awareness to increase.
His life inspires us not to waste food.
We should eat as much as we should.
See, there are similar measures for change.
And those people who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep a little stomach empty, keep a little plate empty.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally depressed.
The problem is that there are such people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are constrained to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are afflicted with depression do not speak anything because they themselves feel embarrassed in this regard.
I would like to tell my countrymen that depression is not a disease that cannot get rid of it.
There is a need to create a psychological environment for this and the first mantra to come out of it is that it requires expression instead of a depression.
Talk to your friends, friends, parents, brothers and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes it feels loneliness and especially the students living in the hostel have more difficulty.
The family is big, we are merging there, due to which there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that whenever you have seen that your daughter or daughter or any member of the family should have a meal with everyone and he should say that I will not be left yet, I will not be left yet, I will not be left on the table and he will not be on the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in the group and lives alone in the corner then keep in mind that this does not happen.
This is an excellent solution.
And depression is the cause of mental and physical diseases.
Just like diabetes is hosting every disease, depression also eliminates our ability to stay, fight, dare and decide.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your environment can stop you from going to depression and if you have gone then you can bring it out quickly.
Help your minds, share their happiness and sorrows, you will feel that your internal pain will end.
If you try to understand their sorrows and do it with service, then you will have a new self-confidence.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, your mind will become lighter.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in liberating stress, liberation from pressure and traveling towards happiness.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
Prepare all of you and celebrate Yoga Festival in lakhs of groups.
If you have any information about the 3rd International Yoga Day, send me through the mobile application.
Whatever songs and poems can be prepared about yoga, they should be prepared so that it can be easily understood to the people.
But along with work, women also have special responsibilities.
He also takes care of family responsibilities and also supports the economic responsibilities of the family due to which sometimes injustice to their newborn children.
At that time, the Government of India has taken a very important decision that these employed women have been extended to 26 weeks from the time of their delivery and the first 12 weeks of their delivery.
There are only two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become the precious reserves of the country.
It will also improve the health of mothers and it will be an important decision for this.
This will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
May the life of all these great men inspire us and enable us to realise the resolution of a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Year is the New Year. My best wishes to all of them for this new year.
This is auspicious time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different parts of the country in different forms.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd No.
Flowers bloom .
Not only the flowers, the fruits on the tree strips are seen shining in the sun.
The fruits of the summer season of mango are also visible in spring .
On the other hand, the yellow flower of mustard in the field gives hope to the farmers.
The flower of casuda indicates the coming of Holi.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written: Whenever the nature is happy, the weather is beautiful, the man also enjoys this season.
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi enhances the color of happiness in the life of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brothers and humanity, we are going to leave Fagan last month and we are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
This spring is a coincidence of two months.
First of all, I would like to thank lakhs of citizens of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestion.
Shobha Jaal has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that many people are not aware of the achievement of ISRO and hence, he said, I will give some information about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile.
Shohaji thanked you very much that you sacrificed the pride of India.
Be it eliminating poverty, eliminating diseases, connecting the world with knowledge and knowledge, technology, science has set its place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a day of pride in Indias life.
Our scientists have raised India's glass pride in front of the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
In the past, after the success of sending Mars Mission Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has created a world record in the space sector.
And it is also a matter of happiness that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is not only for ISRO but also a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISRO's Coast-Effective Afficient Space Programme has become a wonderful event for the entire world and the world is appreciating the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important.
Carto SAT 2D is the satellite of India and will help in planning urban development through dragged photographs, resource mapping, infrastructure, development assessment.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water resources are there in the country, how can it be used, what should be taken care of, this new satellite CatroSat 2D will help in all the topics.
We also sent some pictures as soon as our satellites went.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of joy for us that our young scientists and women scientists have led this entire campaign.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a proud aspect of ISROs success.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
The less the blessings we have given to these scientists to their entire team.
Shohaji has asked another question and that is the security of India, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard.
This thing has not been discussed in a big way, but the attention of Chhata ji has gone on this important point.
India has successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
The interception technologies envisaged the enemies missile at an altitude of about 100 km from the ground during its testing.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that if India comes to attack from 2000 kms away, then this missile will destroy it in space itself.
Whenever we want new technologies, new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And in the development journey of human life, the gynaecologists have played a very big role.
And the distinguished intelligence talent that does not allow the curiosity to remain in the form of a curiosity, they also raise questions within them, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the cause of innovation.
As long as they don't get the answer, they are sitting on their feet.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life then we can say that there is no complete hindrance to this development journey of human life.
Full break is impossible.
The effort to know the universe, the rules of creation and the minds of human beings continues to be continued.
It produces new science and new technology.
And every technology gives birth to a new age of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often said in the matter of mind that our younger generation should increase the attraction towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today's scientific scientific becomes a sustainable transformation in the lives of generations coming in the future.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharti Diwas.
Societal innovations were invited.
How to identify, showcase such innovations, inform the people and how such innovations work for the common man, how to use wild manufacturing, and I have seen how important things have been done.
Many times the problem also showcases the importance of science for solutions.
Within the year 2005, there was rains, floods, seas were also filled and there was a lot of trouble, and whenever there is any natural calamity, the first calamity comes to the poor.
Two brothers have worked with a lot of heart and have developed a house that saves the households from such a calamity, saves the households from filling water and also saves them from water-related diseases.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
The systems also become technology-based.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there was a lot of importance on digital money.
Gradually people are coming out of the cash and are moving forward towards the digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are growing at a rapid pace.
Especially the younger generation has started to have a habit of digital payments with their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to him.
Our country has received huge support from the Lucky Consumer Scheme Digidhan Business Scheme in the past.
It has been about two months since 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And through these two schemes, one initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed all over the country.
And it is a matter of joy that so far 10 lakh people have got rewards under the DGDhan scheme and more than 50 thousand traders have got rewards and more than 150 crore rupees have been received by those who have taken this great mission in this reward.
Under this scheme, the most consumers are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of 50 thousand rupees.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, households, students, all take part in this scheme enthusiastically.
Shriman Santosh ji from Mysore has written on the Narendra Modi app that he got a reward of Rs. 1000 under the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said that I got a reward of Rs. 1000 and at that time I came to know that a poor elderly woman had a fire in her house.
When the luggage was burnt, I felt that the rewards I received, perhaps it was the right of this poor elderly mother, then I gave him thousands of rupees.
You have done a great inspiration.
All the landers continue to know about this digital time.
It keeps talking with such enthusiasm and encourages others.
I would urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and the Lucky Consumer Scheme or the DGDhan Business Scheme that they have received, to make you yourself the messenger of this scheme.
You move it forward and in a way it is an anti-corruption worker.
In a way you are a soldier of ethics.
You know that when 100 days of the Lucky Consumer Scheme are completed, on 14th April, Dr.
It's memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be a draught worth Rs.
There are about forty-four days left.
You can do one thing by remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Recently, the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar was celebrated.
Recalling them, you can learn at least 125 people downloading the Bhim App.
Learn how transactions happen with this and especially to small businessmen around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhima App give special significance to it.
This movement has been going on for the last two-three months, several townships, several villages and cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the roots of the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village empowers the country's economic pace.
I would like to tell you very happy today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the food storage by working hard.
This year, with the hard work of farmers, record food production has been done in our country.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
In the fields this time such crops have been harvested that everyday it seemed that Pongal and Baisakhi are considered today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food has been produced in the country.
This is 8 percent more than the last record recorded by our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I would like to thank the farmers for taking care of the traditional crops as well as the poor in the country, to cultivate different pulses because the poor get the most protein from pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and almost two hundred and nine lakh hectares of land cultivated various pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
My request to my farmer brothers and sisters is eligible for my special gratitude for the kind of hard work done by the farmers of my country by working hard.
My countrymen, this keeps on walking something or the other in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by society, by institutions, organisations, by everybody in our country.
In a way, everyone is seen behaving awareness about cleanliness in some form.
And in the Warangal of Telangana state, not only was the seminar in the dam room but also the importance of the work of direct sanitation was to be used.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 1-18 February.
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and cleaned up and the officials themselves showed that the twin pit toilet can be evacuated and reused.
He also showed how comfortable new technology toilets are and there is no difficulty in evacuating them, there is no shrinking, which is psychological barrier.
And we can also clean the bed of a toilet just like that.
And the result of this endeavour is that through the country, it has given its importance and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet basin then the attention of the country is natural to move towards it.
And this is the cleaning of the toilet pit which we consider waste, but if we see from the point of view of fertilizer, it is like a black gold.
We can see what happens from West to Wealth.
And this has been proved.
One standard "Twin Pit Toilet" for the family of six members is filled in about five years.
After that, waste can be easily removed and redirected to another pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste collected in the pit is completely decomposed.
This decomposed waste is very safe in handling and very important fertilizer from the point of view of fertilizer NPK.
Farmers are well acquainted with NPK.
And now there is a special programme of cleanliness in Doordarshan.
The more such things will be awakened, the more it will benefit.
Several departments are also considered to be Swachhta Pakhwada in the government.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Tribal Development - Tribal Fairs Ministry, will give a boost to this cleanliness drive.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also move forward in the last two weeks in March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang Sportspersons at Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup final organised in this month, India defeated Pakistan for a second consecutive time and enhanced the pride of the country by becoming a world champion.
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, are adventurous, are determined.
Every time we get to learn something or the other from them.
Whether it is for sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
The country's name is illuminating with their achievements.
Our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rubby Sevens Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to all those players.
The entire World Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India as well as inculcate awareness and sensitivity in the family and society.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today this is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign for social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common man.
In every corner of the country, this vivid issue has forced people to think and have brought about a change in the ideas of people towards the old practices that have been going on for years.
When it is reported that the festival is celebrated on the birth of a child, it is very enjoyable.
In a way, positive thinking towards children is becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that under a special campaign in the Kuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, children and children have been banned.
Today, more than 15 children have been stopped.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana.
Under the Conference Model in Kathua district of Jammu Kashmir, all departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and along with orphanage children by the district administration, along with planning of village-subhas, efforts are being made to ensure their education.
Under the Har Ghar Dostak programme in Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being launched to educate children from every village and home.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire and re-educate the children who had been drop-out by launching Apna Bachcha Upna Vidyalaya.
It means that this movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New imaginations are linked to it.
It has been slopped as per local requirements.
I consider it a good sign when we will celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
My dear countrymen and my dear countrymen, you get the opportunity to interact at different times in Mann Ki Baat.
I know a lot from you.
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the poor and the village reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In the past, we have celebrated several festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated in the entire India.
And everybody can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes it feels an innovation in every matter to pick up eighty layers.
And that is why, when I am talking to you today, I look at two Mohans.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had utilised his wisdom, his duties, his capabilities and his thinking to avoid the struggle for fighting the war even thousands of years ago in the circumstances of that time.
And Charkhadhari Mohan also chose such a path, for the preservation of human values for independence, for strengthening the fundamentals of personality, gave such a turn to the freedom struggle, which is surprising for the whole world, is still surprising.
Whether it is the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of laughing in all the fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Shri Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for a bigger festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but also in the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new turn to human history, established new records.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi and in a way it has become a part of his life.
Mahatma Gandhi was always present for the service of anybody, whenever he was required.
He not only gave importance to service, but also stressed the same on the self-help associated with it.
From Bapu's life, we can understand this very well.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the society, humanity and humanity of the individual were the same.
Be it financing farms in Africa, tolstoy farms, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardha Ashram, he laid special emphasis on social development and community mobility in every place in a unique way.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to salute many important places associated with the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhiji used to emphasize the organizationalism with the spirit of service.
Social service and social enhancement, Community Service and Community Mobilisation are the feelings that we can bring down in our flowing life.
In fact, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and the true workplace.
No, my countrymen.
And collectiveness has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi Saddha Shatabdi should have collectiveness and service.
Why don't we get out of the whole of our life
If we have a football team, we will play football, but we will also do a lot of service in accordance with Gandhi ideals.
We can do a lot, we can collect old books and divide it into the poor, spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore enterprises.
Be it goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and service is done with full dedication and it is also done for the feeling of self-sufficient, a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom struggle.
I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, Dandi.
I urge you to visit somewhere or the other associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Whether it is Porbandar or Sabarmati Ashram or the Ashram of Vardha or it is associated with Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And also write two or four words while expressing your feelings.
Several programmes, competitions and exhibitions have also been organized in the coming days.
But one thing in this regard is very interesting, which I want to share with you.
Venice Bianel is a well-known art programme where artists from all over the world gather.
This time, a very interesting exhibition related to the memories of Gandhiji has been placed in the India Pavilion of Venice Bianel.
The pictures of Haripura were specially interesting.
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose was elected as the President is also included in history.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition of their art work during the session.
This is the same Nandlal Bose whose artworks enhance the glory of our Constitution.
It provides a new identity to the Constitution.
And his art work has made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the nearby villages of Haripura and then made some artistic pictures showcasing the lives of rural India.
A lot of discussions were held in the venue of unmatched artifacts.
Once again, with the best wishes of Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary, I look forward to making some resolution from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society, for some part of the country.
You will remember that in the last few years, we have launched the same service campaign for nearly two weeks before October 2 in the country.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will come out of our father's house and pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Whether it is a house or a street or a chowk or a drain or a school or a college, I will run a campaign for cleanliness at all public places.
This time special emphasis has been laid on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eradicate the use of plastic that works together at the same time.
This time on the second October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we will dedicate them to an open defecation free India, and that day we will lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic throughout the country.
I appeal to all the sections of the society, to the residents of every village and small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way in the form of plastic waste-free India.
Celebrate 2nd October as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, it is a special festival of Shramdan.
I urge all the municipalities, municipalities, district administrators, village panchayats, all government and non-governmental systems, all organisations, one citizen, all of them to collect and storage plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they should come forward for proper disposal and evacuation.
It can be recycled.
It can make fuel.
In this way, we can also complete the work of safe evacuation of plastic waste till Diwali.
There is just a need to resolve.
There is no need to see it for inspiration.
What else can be a bigger inspiration than Gandhi
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit-specific is a gem of knowledge in a way.
We can get what we want in life.
Now, my connectivity with them has decreased.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I would like to touch a very important thing from a Sanskrit Subhash.
And those things that have been written centuries ago, but even today, how important it is
It is an excellent definition and has said: Trinni Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhashitam, Mudhai: Pashankhandesh ritual sanctuary is only three rituals of water, food and defined on earth.
The foolish stone is called ratna.
In our culture there is a great month of food.
Even that, the knowledge of food has also been converted into science.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborn children, because these people are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once one thing was brought to me.
Muthibhar Dhanya has become a big movement in Nashik.
Anganwadi workers collect cereals during harvesting days.
These grains are used to make fresh food for children and women.
The person who donates it in a way becomes a aware citizen and a social service.
After that, he dedicates himself to this objective and becomes a soldier of this movement.
We all have heard about the food-prashaan culture in every corner of India.
This culture is done when we start feeding the child for the first time.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run hostage meal campaigns.
If there is a birthday, a good day, a memorable day in the family, then the members of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food, by making tasty food, by going to schools and the members of the family worship, feed, share their happiness and enhance happiness.
There is a unique mixture of service and joy.
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated throughout the country as a Poshan Abhiyan.
I had never thought that this would become my place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I had never thought of how many diversity the youth of our country and the world focus on.
I had never thought that there would be some opportunity in my life to touch the youth of the world.
And it is like this - just last week I had gone to Bhutan.
I have seen that as the Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go anywhere, and because of the International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if I meet and sit in the world then somebody faces a question-answer with me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has planned to spread this programme in their language in 165 countries.
Today, when a global brainstorming on environment, global warming and climate change is going on, I hope that this programme will help the discovery channel in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in the culture journey of India.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me with shrinking that Modi ji said that if you used to speak Hindi and you did not know Beer Greece Hindi, then how was it possible to interact with you so fast
Or later, it has been edited.
He asks a lot of curiosity.
shoes, there is no secret in it.
If there is a question in the minds of many people then I will declare that secret.
Well, it's not a mystery.
The fact is that technology has been utilised in conversation with beer grills.
The companions used to be linguistic and a small cordless instrument was installed in the ears of Beer Greece, which used to be used in English.
I used to speak Hindi, but it used to speak English and it made dialogue more easier and this is the wonder of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places related to nature and wildlife nature and other creatures .
I have said before and I tell you loudly and I will definitely go to Ishaan Bharat in your life.
The world within you will expand.
On 15th August, I had urged all of you to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
That too, for the purpose of 100 per cent tourism, go to such 15 places, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
A country full of diversity will also fill you with diversity in the form of a teacher.
Your life will expand.
Your thinking will become broad.
And trust me that there are such places within India where you will come with new zeal, new enthusiasm, new zeal and new inspiration.
Your family will also feel like that.
My dear countrymen, the care and concern of the environment in India is naturally visible.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce the population of tigers in the country.
You know how many tigers are in India
A resolution was taken by expressing concern over the decreasing population of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a new India that we realise the goal in the earliest.
We have doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
Not only the population of tigers in India, but also the number of reserved areas and community reserved places has increased.
When I was proclaiming the population of tigers, I remembered the lions of Gir of Gujarat.
When I took charge of the Chief Minister there, the lions' residence area was shrinking in the jungle of Gir.
Their number was declining.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2009, we decided to explore women guards there.
Infrastructure reforms have been made to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about protection.
But now we have to think about the compassion of compassion ahead of our defence.
Our scriptures have got a very good guidance in this regard.
My dear countrymen, who can forget that historical speech of Swami Vivekanandji on September 11, 183
The young monks of India, who embarrassed the entire world's humanity, had left India's bright identity in the world.
The way Swami Vivekanandji saw India, Swami Vivekanandji knew the capabilities that India knew, let us compliment him to live.
Everything is within us and come out with confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 2nd August is celebrated as a nation sports day.
On this occasion, we will start the Fit India Movement - Clean India Campaign across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the POSHAN Abhiyan in the month of September, especially in the Swachhta Abhiyan from 11th September to 2nd October and for the complete plastic release dedicated on 2nd October.
Let us come out with a new zeal, new resolution, new energy.
My dear countrymen, the same in Mann Ki Baat today.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your words, your suggestions.
Let us all come out together to make India the dreams of the freedom fighters, to realize Gandhi's dreams - Swant: Sukhai, the joy of the distance with service.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we all celebrated our Republic Day with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at every time, the more important duties are given to the rights, the more important duties should also be obtained.
Only on two lines of rights and duties can Indias democracy move forward at a rapid pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, our revered Bapu is the death anniversary.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a silence of two minutes at 11.
In the form of a society, as a nation, on January 30, two minutes should be paid homage at 11.
Why not for 2 minutes, it should also express its faith in collectiveness, determination and martyrdom.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I extend my best wishes to the brave soldiers who have been honored with different bravery awards.
The awards include many categories like Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal.
I would like to especially urge the youngsters and you are very active in social media.
This time the heroes who have received this honor - Search on your net, write two good sentences related to it and spread it to your colleagues.
We are surprised, proud and motivated when we know the words of their courage, bravery and valour.
On the one hand, when we were happy with the zeal and enthusiasm of 26th January, the soldiers who were engaged in the service of the country in Kashmir were brave due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all those brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I have been continuously doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April all these months take place for every family.
There are examinations of one or two children at home, but the entire family is buried under the burden of examination.
So I realized that this is the right time that I should talk to the student friends, talk to their parents and their teachers because for many years I have visited the place where I have met, the exams have been a cause of a big problem.
There is a strange psychological atmosphere in every household.
And I always feel that we should get out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in some areas today.
When I announced this subject, many teachers, scholars, students sent me messages, sent me questions, expressed pain, also spoke about the problems and I thought about it which I want to talk to you today.
I got a telephone message from the world.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere cannot be pleasant
The question is created but this question will be in your minds.
Exams should be an opportunity for themselves to be a happy occasion.
The whole year has worked hard, the time has come to show that this festival should be a festival of such zeal and enthusiasm.
There are very few people for whom the exams are happy, the examination is a pressure for most people.
It has to be decided that you will be happy to think of pressure.
The joy that will be pleased will be achieved and the pressure that will be required will grow.
And that is why I believe that the exam is a festival, take the exams in such a way that if there is a festival and festival, then the best thing within us comes out.
The feeling of the power of the society also takes place during the festival.
Usually, we feel so disgusting, but if we see the arrangements for the 40-45 days long Kumbh Mela then we can see what is the discipline of Make Shift Arrangement and what is the discipline in people.
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the examination, there should be an atmosphere of festival in the entire family and friends in the neighbourhood.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festivals will make the environment burden free.
And I would like to urge my parents to make an atmosphere of this festival for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months into festivals every year by understanding our tradition and understanding the atmosphere of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed, you will be able to remember your years old things easily.
A year ago, what teacher had said in the classroom will remember the whole scene.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door closes, does not go inside and does not come out.
The thought process stops, which becomes a boss on its own.
You must have seen in the exams that you remember everything, you remember the topic, you remember the topic, you remember the topic, you remember the leaf crown, you have written in the leaf that you remember at the bottom.
Why didn't you remember inside, there was pressure.
But what was inside immediately came out and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall memory then it is a relaxation.
And I say this on the basis of my self-respect that if there is pressure then we forget our things and if there is a relax then we have never imagined and suddenly those things are remembered which are very useful.
And it is not that you do not have knowledge, it is not that you have no knowledge, it is not that you have not worked hard.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your information is suppressed and your tension is lost on it.
And that is why it is important that A Happy Mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exam in the right perspective.
It seems as if it is a question of life and life.
The examinations you are going to give are the tests that you have learned throughout the year.
It's not a cottage of your life.
There is no examination of how you have lived, how you live, how you want to live, how you want to live.
In your life, apart from the tests conducted in the classroom, many people would have got the opportunity to pass through the cottage.
And that is why, with the success and success of life, get rid of such a burden of testing.
Our former President Dr.
He.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a big inspirational example.
Any Richa Anand ji has sent me a question: The biggest challenge that I can see in front of education today is that the educational examination has become focused.
The qualities have become most important.
Because of this, competition has increased significantly and stress has also increased in the students.
So, I would like to know your ideas on this current direction of education and its future.
Though he has answered himself, he wants me to present my point here too.
Marx and Marksheet are very limited uses.
There is no such thing in life.
Life is on how much knowledge you have gained.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, life goes on.
The sense of mission that you have got, your sense of ambition, your mission and ambition have got a blend of life or not.
If you believe in such matters, then Marx will be behind you, you will not have to run behind Marx.
You will work knowledge, skills, self-confidence, will work, will work.
You must tell me that there will be some of your family doctors and every family will go to him who is a family doctor.
There would be no one of you who asked his family doctor how much he had passed.
No one has asked.
Just as you feel that brothers are very good as a doctor, you are benefiting and start serving them.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the lawyer's marksheet
You see his experience, his knowledge and his successful journey.
And that is why the burden of these qualities sometimes stops us from moving towards the right direction.
But it does not mean that I just say that I am not reading.
It is essential for our cottage.
I was tomorrow and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes this happens and if you look at your own lives closely then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities then you will find some ways, you will find some choices and focus on it.
But if you focus on quality, you are gradually shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get a mark.
So it may be possible that despite being hunted in the examination, sometimes you fail in life.
Risha ji has also said one thing - competition.
This is a very big psychological fight.
Indeed, competition does not work to move ahead of life, competition works to move forward and whenever I say that it means to compete with myself.
How to be better tomorrow than yesterday .
One of the characteristics of the lives of most successful players is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
When you are going to give examinations in every field of life then think that if you can read for two hours peacefully then you can read for three hours
Shri S.
Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of Vali.
He says that the role of the vali in the examination is very important.
He has written a lot - my mother was not educated, yet she used to sit with me and tell me to be the entries of calculation.
Because mothers are aware of the future of the children at home, they are active, they make things easier.
Once you learn to accept it, most of the problems will end there.
Everybody feels like that.
The comparison of teachers is in the roots of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Options make it difficult to wait.
Acceptance of the situation gives an opportunity to open new paths.
And therefore accept what is there.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his health.
What is the situation, what is the illness, what is the situation whenever it comes to us.
The tissues began to hear and in the first two-four minutes the atmosphere was lightened .
When we go to a sick person, we often get rid of illness.
I will tell the volunteers, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have we ever felt that in the days of examination we should give children a joyful environment .
You see, the weather will change.
I have come to a Kamal phone call.
Namaskar, elder Prime Minister, I cannot call my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
And when I tried to pass by copying it, I got caught in it and because of me many of my surrounding friends had a lot of trouble and your point is true.
You must have heard it often, do not steal it.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once there is a stolen habit, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where can you reach
Their entire creativity, the same time, if you let them read in the preparation of the examination, you may not have to imitate it.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that we have during our exams and my second question is whether the examination looks heavy or light, why not thank you.
If there is an inclusive development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn it too.
Somebody says I'll first pass all these tests, then I'll play.
So that's impossible.
So the rest of the body should also get physical activity .
Have you ever imagined that when all this is in front of you, you should take a look at the sky for two moments, look at the trees and plants and lighten your mind.
By doing so, you will see that with a freshness you will again come in your room and in your books.
Leave whatever you are doing for a while, get out standing and go to the kitchen and find the things you like, if you get a biscuit in your mind.
Why not just five minutes, but take a little break.
There is no need to be closed in any room to breathe deeply.
Go below the open sky, walk on the sky, take five minutes deep breath and then sit down to read again.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will not only become light but will also make the brain lighter.
Some people feel that I will wake up late at night - I will read more and more.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body needs .
There will be freshness.
There will be a lot of increase in your efficiency.
Whenever I hold meetings during the elections, my throat gets stuck.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me: How many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
So, indeed, if we understand the importance of these things, we will benefit from it.
But it does not mean that just keep sleeping.
Otherwise the people of your family will be disappointed with me.
And on the day your marksheets will come, they will not be seen by you.
This is a very big medicine to keep mind, wisdom, body alert.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the burden of what I have said.
So I also feel that the way I advise your family not to become a boss.
Remembering your resolve, trusting yourself, go for examination.
My best wishes.
Make a cottage, festival to cross every cottage.
Then there will never be a cottage.
Take this mantra forward.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years in February 2019.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Garden for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the four largest Coast Guards in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Gardens had taken a big campaign to clean the coastline of our country along with their responsibilities and joined thousands of people.
And very few people will know that in our country, not only in the coast guards but also women are performing their responsibilities equally by gaining their shoulders.
Coast Gardeny is also a pilot, observer, and is also handled by Honorcraft.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic all over the world, I congratulate him on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard engaged in maritime security of India.
On 1st February, the festival of Basant Panchami is celebrated.
Spring has been approved as the best season.
The queen of spring seasons.
It is considered an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, it is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color de Basanti Chola - This is the inspiration.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Mother Akashwani also fills new forms with its imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my mind, he has started listening to the words of mind in regional languages.
It has got comprehensive approval.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
I congratulate Akashwani for his self-inspired work.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all on Christmas.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
The Prime Minister said that the poor are not our favour, we want to accept it in the Gospel of St. Luke, that Lord Christ has not only served the poor, but also describes the service made by the poor and this is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with this which is very popular.
It is said in the conversation that Lord Christ was standing near the treasure of a temple.
Several immortal people came there and they donated immortality.
After that a poor widow came and gave him two copper coins in the form of donation.
If you want to see that two copper coins will not be said to be a big donation.
It is very natural to be curious in the minds of the devotees present there.
Then Prabhu Issu said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot of money but this woman has donated her universal donations.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviyaji, who brought awareness of determination and self-confidence among the Indian people, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malviyaji's Tapabhoomi, Banaras.
The foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre has been laid at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is being built in this entire region, not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we honoured the country by achieving its success in the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is the leader of the party or the member of Parliament, the minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji has put an idealism in every role.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
A lot of memories with him swim in front of his eyes.
Today, on Christmas day, as a gift, the countrymen are going to get the benefit of two schemes.
In another way, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is village or city, educated or illiterate, what is cashless, how can cashless business be run, how can it be purchased without cash
Everybody wants to learn from each other.
Two new incentives are being launched by the Government of India, on behalf of the consumers and for small traders to promote this thing, to make mobile banking stronger.
One scheme to promote consumers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and other schemes for promotion of traders - Digidhan Trade Scheme.
Today, as a gift of Christmas on 25th December, 15 thousand people will get prizes from the draw system and they will be filled in the accounts of fifteen thousand people in a prize of one thousand rupees and this gift is not just limited to one day today, this scheme will start from today to 100 days.
Fifteen thousand people will get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
In 100 days, lakhs of families will have to get a gift of crores of rupees, but this reward will be entitled only when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI (UPI), USSD (USSD) methods of digital payment and dry will be dried on the basis of this.
At the same time, there will be a big draw one day a week for such customers, including the prizes of lakhs and three months later, on 14th April, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumper draw which will have a reward of crores.
Digidhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Businesses themselves connect with this scheme and also connect consumers to make their business cashless.
Such traders will also be given separate rewards and these rewards will be in thousands.
Businesses will also run their own business and will also get a glimpse of rewards.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, especially the common poor and the lower middle class at the centre and that is why those people who buy more than 50 rupees and buy less than three thousand rupees will get the benefit of this scheme.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of this reward.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through Feature phones, ordinary phones and sell goods and sell money and every person can become the beneficiary of this scheme.
Even in rural areas, people can buy and sell through AEPS and those people can also win the reward.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and those youngsters around you will definitely be aware of it, you can ask them.
Hey, even in your family, there will be children studying in class 10th-12th, they will also be able to teach you this thing easily.
This is very simple - the way you have sent a vote-up message from mobile phones is that easy task.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know that awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments is increasing at a fast pace.
In the last few days, cashless trade, cashless trade has increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
How big is this decision, food traders can apply it properly.
Such traders have been exempted from income tax to those who do digital transactions, develop online payments instead of cash in their business.
Everyone has moved this mission in its own way.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu Naidu, who is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that several state governments have also started and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Somebody told me that the Government of Assam has decided to give 10 discount on digital payments of property tax and trade licence fees.
Those rural banks whose branches will get at least two digital transmissions of 5 percent of their consumers during January-March, they will get a reward of Rs 50,000 from the government.
The Government has announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakhs under the Uttam Panchayat for Disease Transfer to 100 Digital Transfer villages by 31st March, 2017.
Under Digital Agricultural Shiromani for the farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, which will be fully digitally paid to the users for procurement of seeds and fertilizers.
I extend my best wishes to the Government of Assam and salute all the governments that will start this auspicious occasion.
Many institutions have also made several successful experiments to promote digital procurement among the poor farmers.
I have come to know that the GNFC - Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited, which works mainly for fertilizers, has installed a thousand POS machines where the farmers sell fertilizers, and 5 lakh fertilizers bags have been given digitally to 35 thousand farmers and this work has been done in the last two weeks.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, in our lifestyle, the informal sector is very big and most of the people are paid the money of labour, the money of work or the salary of cash, and we know that this is the reason why the labourers are absorbed.
They get 80, 80, 50 and other healthcare facilities like insurance are also deprived of where they get 100 rupees.
But now cashless is being paid.
Rupees are being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the absorption is being shut down, the absorption has to be shut down and it has become possible for the labourers, the artisans and such ordinary people to get full return.
Friends, other benefits are also being entitled to that benefit.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
We have got technology easily.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress from startups.
This digital investment is a golden opportunity.
Our youth should strengthen this region with innovative ideas, innovative technologies, innovative methods, as well as with the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
Most of the people in the sections of other writers have taken note of the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's pleasure, such a sacred work, however, people have also mentioned how to find new ways for misconducts.
And the third stage is that in which people have supported what is happening, but along with this, this fight should go ahead, corruption and black money should be destroyed, there should be more stringent steps for it, those who enhance such enthusiasm and write.
I am grateful to the people of the country that I have helped me write so many letters.
Mr. Gurumani has written only on Mai Gov: "This step to curb the black money is commendable.
We are getting troubled by the citizens, but we are fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we are supporting in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money etc. like military forces, the same spirit that Gurumani Ji has written is emerging in every corner of the country.
We are all feeling it.
But it is also true that whenever people suffer from pain and suffer from difficulties then who is such a person who does not suffer from pain
I also have the same pain as you have.
But for a better goal, to achieve a high goal, whenever it works with a good destiny, then the people of the country remain courageous in the midst of these sufferings, grief and pain.
In fact, these people are the first to change.
I express my gratitude to the people for another reason that they have not only faced difficulties, but have also given an answer to some people who are trying to mislead the people.
Somebody has said that the price of salt has increased, somebody has to spread salt, somebody has to cancel the notes of 2000, the notes of 500 and 100 have to be canceled.
I salute this capability of the people too.
My dear countrymen, I am explicitly feeling that nothing is impossible when 1.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country, I salute them that people have participated with full zeal in this great yagya against corruption and black money.
There will be a comprehensive discussion in the Parliament for political parties as well as for the financing of political parties.
If the Parliament had gone, it would have been a good discussion.
The people who are spreading foolishness, the political parties have all the discounts are wrong.
Those who are unable to support open corruption and black money, they are trying to find the errors of the government all the time.
This government is for public dedication.
The government is constantly trying to take the talent of the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day, on the eighth day that this fight is extraordinary.
Over 70 years, the beneficiaries who have been associated with the black business of insurgency and corruption have the strength
When I have decided to compete with such people, those people also adopt new methods every day to defeat the government.
I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Whala.
How did this become possible
I told her secret.
The secret is that I am getting all these information from the people.
More than the information received by the government system, many months are being received from other citizens and most of us are getting success due to the awareness of the common citizens.
Anybody can imagine how much the awakening citizen of my country is taking the risk of opening such elements
And the information that is getting is mostly getting success.
I am confident that you can also send an email address for this purpose.
You can also send it to Mai Gov.
There is also a third group of writers who are also in large numbers.
He says: Modi ji will not be tired, he will not stop, and the harder steps he has to be taken, but now he has taken the path once he has to reach Manzil.
I express my special gratitude to all those who write such letters because their letters also have a kind of faith and blessings.
And there is no question of getting back in the work that has the blessings of hundreds of crores of people of the country.
We have expelled it and have enacted the law of Benami Property.
These laws will also work in the coming days.
Our priority is to do whatever we have to do for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, even in Mann Ki Baat last month, I had said that in spite of these difficulties, our farmers have laboured hard and have broken the record of last year.
This is a good sign from the point of view of agriculture.
Be it the labourers of this country, be it the farmers of this country, be it the youth of this country, the hard work of all these is bringing new colors today.
In the past, on the global economic forum, India has engraved its name in many sectors with great pride.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have achieved 16 positions in the Global Soiling Index-2016 and improved 17 ranks in the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index 2016.
There are several reports which have also been guided to this direction in evaluation and India is moving forward at a fast pace.
The Vice President also openly expressed his disagreement.
But in such a situation, sometimes there are some good things and then the mind gets a great satisfaction.
An excellent work was done in the House of Parliament on which the country did not pay attention.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel very proud and pride in telling this thing that my government has passed a bill related to the campaign of Divyangjan.
I also express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to the crores of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to the Divyangjans.
I have also tried to make it more efficient by taking it personally.
I meant that the Divyangjans get their rights and respect, which they have the right to do.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and trust when they brought four medals in Paralympics.
He has not only enhanced the dignity of the country by his victory but has also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, we have an invaluable heritage and invaluable heritage.
I am delighted to note that after the passage of this law in the interest of the persons with disabilities, there will be more job opportunities for the person with disabilities.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides special provisions for education, facilities and grievance redressal of Divyangjans.
You can estimate how sensitive the government is for Divyangjans that in the last two years, the central government has organized four thousand three hundred and fifty camps for Divyangjans and has distributed equipment to 5 lakh 80 thousand Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs 352 crore.
The government has passed new laws in accordance with the spirit of the Nation.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been a discovery from the field of sports that has made us all proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-fourths in the category against England.
The work of some young sportspersons was commendable.
Test Sukani Virat Kohli, along with good beatings, also led a good leadership.
The Indian Cricket Team off-spinner R.
ICC has declared Ashwin as the best cricketer and best test cricketer for the year 2016.
My very congratulations to these people - many best wishes.
After fifteen years in the Hockey sector, there were very good news and we gave a glorious information.
Our Junior Hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, this opportunity has come that when the Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
Congratulations to young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also wondered.
India's Women's Hockey Team also won Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago, India's Women's Hockey team won bronze in the Asia Cup competition for sportspersons under the age of 18.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of the cricket and hockey team.
Last month we were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas along with the ITBP personnel and soldiers.
He looked full of emotions and not only this, the good wishes that the people of the country sent and included the security forces of the country in their joy was a wonderful reflection.
And people did not just send messages, they were connected with their minds.
Someone made a video i.e. almost every household became a chawk of soldiers.
And whenever I saw those letters, I was surprised to know how much feelings are filled with, and MiGov thought of it that some select things should be starved and made a coffee table book.
Work is going on.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of the feelings of the soldiers of the country, the spirit of the security forces of the country will be integrated in this book.
But this time it did not seem to be true.
This time it did not seem that there is a festival and I am not at home.
It seemed as if we are also celebrating Diwali with 1. 5 billion Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
Just a while ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanchs of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, with so much comfort, those Sarpanches of the villages spoke, everything touched my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of those children.
Today, I am happy that all those Sarpanches who came from the Kashmir valley have fulfilled the promises made by me in a better way and have made all the people aware by going to the villages.
Just a few days ago, when the board examination took place, about 95 of the daughters and daughters of Kashmir-Kashmir students participated in the board examination.
The presence of such a large number of students in the board examinations indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to a bright future, through education, to achieve new heights of development.
I would like to congratulate him for this zeal, but along with my heartfelt congratulations to his parents, his sons, his teachers and all the village Sarpanchs.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the suggestions of all have come on one side.
Everyone used to say that we should talk about 500 and one thousand notes in the area.
However, while addressing the nation on 8th November, I had discussed the introduction of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the decision is as important as it is implemented.
And I was supposed to have faced many new problems in our common life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its effect and then we will be able to move towards normal conditions.
The diseases that we have been suffering from forty-five years cannot be easy to get rid of diseases.
I can understand your problems and telephones in a good way.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to confuse you, even though sometimes the incidents that make your mind a foolish, you have well understood this path of truth, you have well accepted this thing of the country's interest in shutting down the notes of five hundred and thousand.
And such a big country, such a lot of notes, billions of notes and these decisions are being seen by the world very minutely, every economist is analyzing and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that will the hundreds of crores of Indians be able to achieve success even by collecting problems and descriptions
There may be a question mark in the minds of the world.
India has only faith in the hundreds of crores of Indians and it is believed that hundreds of crores of Indians will be fulfilled by the resolutions.
And our country will come out in every way like gold and the reason for this is that you are the citizens of this country.
The path of this success has also become possible due to you.
All the units of the Central Government, State Governments, Local Institutions, lakhs of bank employees, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
Between various kinds of tensions, all these people are working with a very calm mind as a yagya of service to the country and are trying to make a great change.
When it starts in the morning, it does not even know when it will happen at night, but all are doing it.
And this is the reason that India will succeed in this.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and the post office are working with such difficulties.
And if we talk about humanity then they look two steps ahead.
Somebody told me that an elder brother had an accident in Khandav.
Suddenly there was a need for money.
This thing came to the notice of the local bank staff there and I am happy to know that they came to their homes and the older person to help in the treatment.
Innumerable cases come out in television, media, newspapers and conversations every day.
I conclude my heartfelt gratitude to all those who work hard in this Mahayagya and those who work hard in this Mahayagya.
Shakti lays down only when it crosses the cottage.
I remember that the campaign of the Bada Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the bank employees picked it up on their shoulders, they had shown the work that was not done in the last sixteen years.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of the hundred and fifty crore people of the country, the collective man of all, will make this nation a new strength and make progress.
They are looking for illegal ways to save their money.
The sad thing is that in this also he has discovered ways using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by talking about greed or temptation, by putting money in their accounts or by doing some work with them.
Today, I would like to tell such people whether to improve or not, whether to comply with the law or not, it will be your wish to do the law or what to do.
But please do not disturb the lives of the poor.
Do not do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and afterwards when checks are conducted, my dear poor get stuck in trouble due to your sin.
And Benami wealth has become such a stringent law that is being enforced, it will bring a lot of trouble and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name crosses Ashish.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Taluk, Harda district, Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say several examples in Mann Ki Baat that despite being uncomfortable people have welcomed this tough decision for the progress of our nation, which will enhance enthusiasm among the people and the cashless system is very important for nation building.
I am very happy that you have closed the notes of thousands and five hundred.
I call Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you because you had said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
Looking at the notes of five hundred and thousand, the black money and the corrupt people have got foolish reading.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
For this, I would like to give you full gratitude.
Some things are known through the medium of media, through the medium of people, through government sources, the enthusiasm of working increases.
It is so enjoyable that it is so proud that how the common man has a wonderful capability in my country
If you get the opportunity to go to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this path then you must pay the money.
And people go there, gather and pay money after two-four days.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, a sense of sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss tea in the elections and this thing has reached the whole world.
People from many countries of the world have also learnt to speak the word 'Chaa Parikhara'.
But I didn't know that there would be a marriage in 'Chaa Para Discussion'.
I came to know that on 17th November there was a marriage in Surat which took place with a discussion on tea.
One daughter in Surat, Gujarat gave only tea to those who came to the wedding and did not spend anything else.
The Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat who have contributed to this fight against corruption and black money through their marriage will become inspirational.
When I was late at night, I saw TV and I saw in the news that there was a small village named Dhekia Juli in Assam.
There the artisans of tea gardens live and they get money every week.
What did they do when they got a note of Rs 2,000
Four women from Adaash-Padush got together and went all around and bought and paid with a note of Rs. 2,000, they did not need a small note because they bought together and decided that when we got it next week we would sit and see the account.
People are looking for their own ways.
And also look at changes.
The people of the tea gardens of Assam are telling us that we should apply ATMs there.
Look, how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefits of this campaign.
The country will get the benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipality gets tax rate of about 50 per cent.
However, due to this decision on 8th this time all the people ran to deposit their old notes.
47 urban units had a tax of about Rs. 3,500 crore during this period last year.
You will be surprised to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in a single week.
Now if four times the money has been received in the municipality then it is natural that there will be a sewage system in the poor population, there will be arrangements for water and anganwadi.
Several examples are being found in which it has direct benefits.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is ensuring itself in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have discovered roads in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are problems but I am confident that if there is a difficulty and natural calamities, then it will continue to stand at this time too.
The small traders of our country, who also provide employment, are also increasing economic activity.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that even small shopkeepers of villages like big malls can now do their business for 24 hours, no law can stop them because I believe that if big malls get 24 hours then why should not the poor shopkeepers of the villages get their business
A big initiative has been taken to provide loans to them through the Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been brought to such small people through the Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses and give a boost to the business of billions of rupees.
But it is natural for them to have trouble with this decision.
You also download the bank's app in mobile phones.
You should also set up a POS machine for a credit card, learn how you can do business without a note.
Technological roads are safe and faster.
I would like to assist you in making this campaign a success and not only lead you to change and I am confident that you can lead a change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the entire village business.
I would also like to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have been absorbed a lot.
There is a salary on paper and when it comes in hand, it is different.
Sometimes the entire wages are available, sometimes somebody is standing outside and sometimes it has to be given a little share and the labourers forcefully make this absorption a part of life.
With this new system, we wish that you have a bank account, your wage money will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages will be followed.
Nowadays, your mobile phones also work as e-pockets. You can also pay the money from the same mobile phone to the small shops of the neighborhood.
Therefore, I urge the labourers brothers and sisters to become participants in this scheme because finally I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived and the victims of the country.
Today, I would like to talk to the youth especially.
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 of the population below 35 years of age.
Young people and women of my country, I know that my decision would have been liked by you.
I also know that you are supporting this decision.
I also know that you are contributing significantly to this thing positively.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati and have got the opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
Can you help my youngsters
I will cooperate with you, I will not stop talking with it.
The more experience you are from today's world, the older generation is not the same.
The elder brothers in your family may not be aware and parents, kakakis and maternal uncles may not be aware of it.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is done.
All these things are very common for you and you also use it but today the country that wants to do the great work is our dream of cashless society.
Hundred percent cashless society is not possible but whether India starts the Lass Cash Society.
Once we start the Lass Cash Society today, the floor of the Cashless Society will not be far away and I will see your physical help in it, you will see your time, you will see your resolution.
And I am confident that you will never despair me because we all want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know that today there are many opportunities for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Every bank provides online facility.
The direct meaning of the vote is e-packet.
Many types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards and after 8th, RuPay cards were used very little.
The poor have started using RuPay cards and there has been an increase of about 300.
Like the prepaid cards are available in mobile phones, prepaid cards are also available in banks to spend money.
One of the best platforms is the UPI of doing business which you can also buy, you can send money, you can also get money and this work is so easy as you have sent it to the votesapp.
Today, how the message is sent to the uneducated person.
Not only this, technology will become so simple that there is no need for any big smartphone for this work.
Every bank has also been charged with it and now the cost of online surcharge has also been eliminated and other such cards have also been given to them that in 2-4 days, every expenditure has been eliminated so that cashless society's movement gets boosted.
My young friends, even after all this, a whole generation is such that is familiar with this.
And as much as I know, you people are active in this great work.
As I have sent a positive message on the votesapp, I have seen all these slogans, poems, cases, cartoons, innovative imaginations and the creative power of our youth in the midst of many difficulties, it seems that this is the speciality of the land that during a time when the Gita was born in the battlefields, the same way we are passing through such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I want your help in this work.
Yes, I once again say that I want your help and I am confident that crores of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Let us do one thing, pledge from today that you will become a part of yourself for cashless society.
All the technologies to spend online on your mobile phones are available.
Not only this, how technology is being used for at least 10 families by taking out half an hour or two hours everyday, how to download their bank apps and how to spend the money that has fallen in your account
How to teach shopkeepers to do business
You will voluntarily lead this cashless society, the great campaign to bring it out of the circle of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from problems and difficulties.
Once the RuPay card will be used to people, the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens will learn this system then they will probably get rid of all the concerns and if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this work then I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we can stand up as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 households everyday and connect 10 households everyday.
I invite you, let us not only support, but we will be the army of this transformation and keep on taking changes.
We will take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there is a wealthy country in the world where the youngsters have changed the lives of the nation and they will have to understand that the change that brings to the youth, the revolution that makes the youngsters.
Kenya, he got very fast, M-PESA used the technology of such a mobile system, named M-PESA and today almost all the trade in this region of Africa has come to Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this mission forward.
I invite you to do this work collectively, personally, every school, college, university, NCC, NSS.
We will further this thing.
We have got an opportunity to serve the country's best, which is not to lose the opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Shriman Amitabh Bachchan ji has given a slogan for this cleanliness campaign.
You must have seen that Amitabh Bhaji, the most popular artist of this century, is taking forward the mission of cleanliness very well.
It seems that the topic of cleanliness has spread in his nassenses and he also remembered the work of cleanliness on his father's birth anniversary.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So his son, Shriman Amitabh ji, who has been running a mission of cleanliness in the nassense, has written to me using the poems of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Tana, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My Acquaintance.
I salute Harivansh Rai Ji with respect.
I thank Mr. Amitabh ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in this way and for taking forward the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your emotions and your letters always keep me connected with you on MYGOV and Narendra Modi app.
Now Mann Ki Baat happens at 11 o'clock, but soon after that we will start in regional languages.
I am grateful to Akashwani, the new initiatives that are being taken by those people that will definitely get the opportunity to connect my countrymen to it where Hindi is not popular.
Thank you very much.
Lookers from far off places feel as if the name of the Indian Life Festival is second and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been in India since the Vedas till date have been a festival that brings about a change in time.
We have seen the courage to end the tradition of festivals outside from time to time and the change in festivals as per the demand of time and society has also been easily accepted.
And that is done through this festival.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today, the whole world discusses the environment and becomes a matter of natural destruction.
Festival of India is a boost to nature's love, from child to person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds or birds, everybody has a festive feeling of responsibility.
Nowadays we keep a holiday on Sunday, but those who are older generations, those who are labourers, fishermen etc....
That is why even we had developed the tradition of keeping the vacation integrated to the universe and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Diwali, as I said, every festival of ours is academic.
One thing we all know very well, let us go to any corner of India, let us go to Amir's house, let us go to the hut of the poorest of the poor, on the festivals of Diwali, every family gets to see a cleanliness drive.
The every corner of the house is cleaned.
But there is a demand of time that not only the cleanliness of our house but also the cleanliness of the entire campus and the cleanliness of the entire village.
We have to expand our nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer confined to the borders of India.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in some form or the other in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, even the Parliament and the rulers there have started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Be it the eastern or the west, whether it is a developed country or a developing country, be it Africa or Ireland, Deepawali is seen.
You all will know that the US postal service of the United States has also released Deepawali postage stamp this time.
Canada's Prime Minister has also shared his pictures on the occasion of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised the Honourable Convention that connects all society on the occasion of Diwali in London, he himself took care of it and perhaps the U.
And what is Tasvir
16 women Parliamentarians from Singapore are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saras and this photo has become viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
Deepawali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Australian Prime Minister has conveyed his best wishes to the Indian community on the occasion of Deepawali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said that I have to return soon because I have to attend the festival of Diwali. I mean that Deepawali, this festival of light, this festival of light, the world community is also being inspired to take from darkness to light.
Besides good clothes, good food, etc. on the festival of Deepawali, there is also a lot of smoke of crackers.
And the children, the youth are very happy.
Whenever it does not even take care of what has happened nearby .
In the days of Diwali, news of accidents, news of fire, news of abduction creates serious concerns.
And there is a problem that on the day of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is very long.
It's not just one day.
In this, the Govardhan Puja, the brothers, the beneficiaries, the beneficiaries, and the light festival of Kartiki Purnima, it continues for a long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
The festival of Chhath Puja is a very big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But it has a specialty that it gives a very deep message to the society.
But it is said that brothers, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath Puja is a festival in which the rising sun is also worshipped .
There is a very big social message in this festival...
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali that we should talk about Chhath Puja, this time we have to convey my best wishes to you.
But there is also a special time for me.
I am particularly grateful to the people of the country, to express gratitude.
In the events that have been taking shape for the past few months, our soldiers are looting their best for our well-being.
The sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces on my future world continues to remain intact.
And one of them was in mind that this Diwali should dedicate to the defence forces.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Solzers.
But today I would like to bow down my head and say that there will be no human being in India, whose unprecedented love for the soldiers of the country is proud of the army, the way it has been expressed, it will give strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine for the soldiers of the security forces, the more courageous one of your messages has emerged as possible.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or cinemas, fortunately anyone who has not shown lamps for the soldiers of the country, has not given messages to the people of the country, the media has also converted this Deepotsav to an opportunity to express gratitude to the army and why not
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibetum Police, Assam Rifles, Air Force, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot call the names of all of you, but what kind of pain do we face innumerable of our soldiers
I can imagine how proud this moment is for the soldiers of my country
Message to Solzer's Hashtag has so many activities, in a negative way, what do you talk about
I want to read that Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Such sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message. What do we call the army family
Namaskar is the Prime Minister, I speak Shiva's fascination.
The message to self-soldiers campaign that has been launched by this Diwali is encouraging our army brothers.
I am a military family.
My husband is also the officer of the army.
My father and mother-in-law have been the officers of the army.
So our entire family is full of soldiers.
I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also make such a good sacrifice.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are not only on the border but also on every frontier of life.
Natural disasters, sometimes there is a crisis of law and order, sometimes there is a need to fight against the enemies, sometimes to show courage to turn the youngsters back on the wrong path, our youngsters continue to work inspired by nationalism on every turn of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh is free from open defecation free.
Now Himachal has also been built and the first November is going to become Kerala.
But how can this success be seen
Now our ITBP personnel had gone to the village on their own duties.
So perhaps the village council was going to meet at that time and it was going to be discussed in the Gram Sabha and the toilets were being constructed.
It was found that some families could not make toilets due to lack of money.
It should be forgotten and see their patriotism, it is not the same that they used to serve the country by leaving pills on enemies.
He took seventy five thousand rupees out of his checkbook and gave it to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those 5 households who did not have toilets, on behalf of me give it one thousand rupees to every family.
I really want to thank the youngsters.
I have noticed that in the far-flung jungles of Kerala, where there is no road, that village can be reached with difficulty all day walking on foot.
The tribal Panchayat Idmalakudi is difficult to reach there, so the students of engineering in the nearby urban areas were noticed that this village is going to have toilets.
Candidates of NCC, youth of NSS, students of engineering together decided that we will build toilets.
The youngsters who had to carry the toilets, bricks, cements and all the goods, took their shoulders and walked on foot all day and went to Pela jungle.
They worked hard and made toilets in the village and these youngsters freed a small village in a remote jungle.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared more than 150 municipalities as open defecation free.
10 districts have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee for the first time and he has decided that in just a few months he will make the entire state ODF.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens of all these states for connecting with this great work and for contributing to the elimination of the darkness of the country.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes in the government and after the first scheme, if there is a good plan then the first scheme has to be released.
However, it usually does not pay any attention to these things.
Old schemes are also going on and new schemes are also going on and they are also waiting for the upcoming schemes.
This keeps on running.
In our country, there is no need for kerosene in the households that have gas connections and electricity.
Those families who have gas connections, the households who have electricity, have been purchased from the base number and I have heard that now seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free.
I am confident that the entire politics will soon become kerosene-free.
And the facilities of the people will also increase. Yes, there will be difficulty, the middlemen will have difficulty, the criminals will have difficulty.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything they should go to the country even today decides the criteria for all these things.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan, first of all remember the poor and weak faces and then decide whether the poor will benefit from what you are going to do or not
You decide on the basis of this criteria.
The need of the hour is to satisfy the hopes of the poor of the country.
To get rid of the difficulties, we have to take one step after another.
Whatever our old thinking is, the society must be freed from the discrimination of daughter-in-law.
It is the 21st century and the darkness in the village cannot go away now.
And that is why the mission of providing electricity to the villages is successfully moving forward to free the villages from darkness.
The time limit is moving forward.
After so many years of independence, what will be the health of the poor mothers and the smoke of 400 cigarettes by cooking kitchens on a wooden stove
These five crore families are successfully moving forward to provide a smoke-free life.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk-suppliers, swimming shopkeepers and princes used to stay stuck in the rounds of interest.
My dear countrymen, yesterday on 31st October, the great man of this country who made the mantra of India a mantra of his life.
On the one hand, October 31 is the celebration of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb and the survivor of the unity of the country is a great man.
On the other hand, there is also the death anniversary of Smt.
We should remember the virtue of the great men as well as do.
But I was touching the phone and pain of a gentleman from Punjab, Prime Minister Namaskar, sir, I am speaking Jasdeep.
From Punjab, Sir, you know that on 31st day is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is such a distinction that has spent his entire life in connecting the country and I feel that he has succeeded and brought everyone along.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of one person.
A Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
Successful efforts to bring the free India down the flag, such a big Bhagirath work which was done by the Mahapuruse, salute the great man.
But it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, was humbled for unity, because of his priorities of unity, was also a victim of solidarity but never left the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lives for unity, and on the birth anniversary of Sardar, with Sardars, one step of history pains all of us.
But in the midst of these calamities, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of that country.
There are many languages, varieties, dresses, food habits, but unity in diversity is the power of India.
The root of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's life journey started with the struggle for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sometimes many of us have heard the name of Amul.
Today people are also familiar with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that he was a divine vision of Sardar Saheb, who had imagined a cooperative milk producer federation.
And the Kheda districts which were known as 'Kera' district at that time, and in 1942, he strengthened this idea.
As a result, today's Amul is a living example of the kind of sand that Sardar Saheb had created for the farmers.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on this unity day, on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb and resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, in this series of festivals of Diwali, Kartiki Purnima is also a festival of light festival.
Guru Nanakdev, his Bodhgaya is still a guide for the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev for service, truth and all.
This was the original mantra of peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the top of the distortion of the untouchable, ethnic, sex, and its deformity, Guru Nanak Dev liked Bhai Lalo as his associate.
Let us also showcase the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev has given us, the motivation that inspires us to leave discrimination, if we want to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' then who can be the best guide of Guru Nanak Dev.
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival of his birthday is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again the name of this Diwali to the soldiers of the country.
Thank you very much...
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat Programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days.
I salute all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was enough to shake the whole country.
There is also anguish in the country, there is also anguish in the country. And this loss has not only occurred to those families who lost their sons, brothers and husbands and lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to our citizens and politicians and we also speak.
But the army does not speak, the army shows valour.
Today, I would like to talk to the people of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the opponents of the country well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have come out on the path of peace by seducing such elements from themselves.
Every parents want schools and colleges to work as soon as possible, the farmers are also feeling that the crops, fruits etc. which have been produced are available to the markets across India.
Economic activity also goes well.
And for the last few days, business has started well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, our progress is the path of development.
For our future generations, we have to reach new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem by sitting together, finding a way out and paving the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that governance.
The administrative system has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
And we will follow it completely.
Sometimes, the people who think judiciary also offer new ideas from what we think.
Now I have the opportunity to know a lot in social media.
Every corner of India provides an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of every kind of people and strengthens the power of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of 11th standard put a different idea before me.
He wrote, I was very uncomfortable after the Uri terrorist attack.
But the way to do something does not swell and what can a small student like me do
I thought of how to work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I would study three hours more every day.
It will become a good citizen for the country to work.
Brothers and sisters, Harsh Vardhan is a matter of joy for me that in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age you can think healthyly.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the nation's consciousness.
But you would be aware that when the war of 165 took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and there was such a passion and anger throughout the country, there was a zeal of patriotism.
Everybody wanted to get rid of something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this feeling of the country.
And by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, he inspired the people of the country to work for the country.
Another path of expressing patriotism between the voices of Bomb and Banduk was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi was driving the freedom movement, when the movement was at its rapid pace and there was a need for stability in the movement, he used to use that intensity of the movement very successfully towards creative work in the society.
If all of us, the army, the army, the people sitting in power perform their duty and if we make a constructive contribution with the spirit of patriotism, with the spirit of patriotism, then our country will surely scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who went to Paralympics made history and their views are a victory of human emotions.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done a great job and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only this, but every person in the country has got an emotional link to our sportspersons of Paralympics.
Perhaps the paralysis of our sportspersons and our sportspersons have changed the vision of humanity and our vision towards Divyangjans.
There is a great strength in this speech.
This time, 17 sportspersons, including 3 women from our country, participated in the Paralympics.
As compared to other sportspersons, when Divyangs play, physical capabilities, sports capabilities are even greater.
He won the gold medal at Bhai Devendra Jhazria Bhalafenk, who won the gold medal for the second time and won it again after 12 years.
The age increases in the age of 12 years and once the golden medal wins, the zeal also reduces a little.
But Devendra explained that the condition of the body or the age of the age could never weaken his resolution and he brought the golden moon for the second time after 12 years.
And they were not disabled from birth.
They had to lose their own hands due to electric bites.
Think of the person who wins the first gold medal at the age of 23 and won another gold medal at the age of 35.
Merrippan won a gold medal in a high dog.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg at the age of just 5 years.
Poverty did not come under their determination.
They are neither living in big cities nor from middle class families.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, he gave medals to the country with determination in the midst of physical difficulties.
With the name of Deepa Malik of Sportspersons, the pride of hoisting a variety of winners has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati won the bronze medal in the high rank.
These medals of Paralympics are not only the greatest, but in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood and in our neighbourhood, these medals have done a big job to look at our Divyang brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivity has awakened, but our vision of looking towards these Divyangjans has also changed.
Very few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans have done their valour in the paralysis of this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics competition took place at that place.
This time it has been built.
A 1500 meter race with the Olympics winners of the Golden Channel in the event, Abdul Taif Baka, Algeria, broke the 1500 meter race for Divyangjans from a short time to a new record.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth number of persons with disabilities did not get any medal as a race medal, but he also ran in less time than those who won the gold medal in the competition of ordinary runners.
I once again congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for Paralympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A mega camp of the Government of India was organised for Divyangjans and it established a lot of world orders.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book which has collected the success stories of some Divyangjans.
There were very inspiring events.
India and Navsari have made a world record which I consider to be important.
It was successfully used to insert machines to listen to sixty disabled persons who could not hear within eight hours.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to set up three world records by Divyangs in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the second October, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Pujaya Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should become our habit and every citizen should be duties.
Now when two years are going on for the second October, I can say with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of hundreds of crores of people of the country.
And I said, towards cleanliness, today we all can say that everybody has tried to move one step ahead.
That is, the country has moved ahead with hundreds of crores of steps towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
How good its fruits are, what happens with some such efforts has also been seen.
Be it the bus station, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, hostels, children to the elderly, villages, poor, farmers, women, all are contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For the sake of health, for the honour of the citizens, especially for the honor of mothers and sisters, the kutav should be stopped in the open.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in a very close future towards elimination of the habit of open trees.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officers told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF on the second October.
I would like to introduce a scheme for young friends, especially those who use technologies nowadays.
Everybody has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1866.
By calling this number 16, you will not only know the condition of construction of toilets in your city but you will also be able to apply for making toilets.
You must take advantage of it.
Not only this, we have started a Swachhta App to find out the situation of sanitation related grievances and grievance redressal.
The Government of India has also urged the corporate world to come forward in this regard.
They can be sent as Swachh Bharat Fellows in the districts.
This Swachhta Abhiyan cannot be confined to the cultures only.
It is not enough that cleanliness becomes a habit.
The waste should be fertilizer manufactured and it has also been started by the Government during the policy framework.
Fertilizer companies have been told to buy compost central fertilizer from waste.
And those farmers who want to go to livelihoods should reach this fertilizer.
Those people who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the earth, those who want to stop the damage caused due to chemical fertilizers, if they need such fertilizers in some quantity then the companies will provide such fertilizers to them.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a brand ambassador.
I invite the youngsters to develop new start-ups in the Waste to Wealth- Waste to Kanchen Jhumbesh, develop such instruments, develop such technologies and work for affordable manufacturing.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, an Indoneson-India Sanitation Convention is also being organized.
Together, the Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country, only one has to pay homage to cleanliness.
What can happen in technology
What can be the economic framework
How can people participate
How can the chances of employment be increased in it
All the topics have to be discussed.
And I am seeing that there are almost innovative information about cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University launched a awareness campaign to build toilets in 10 villages.
He worked hard on his own and contributed to the construction of nearly a thousand toilets.
A few days ago, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, a team swimming in the Ganga from Devprayag to Gangasagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a calendar period of one year in its respective departments.
Each department will focus on cleanliness for 15 days especially.
In the next October, the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development are scheduled to work together for enhancing sanitation in their respective fields from 1st to 15th October.
And the last two weeks of the month of October 16th October to 31st October, the other three departments of the Department of Agriculture Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Department of Consumer Affairs, these three departments will run a cleanliness drive for 15 days.
You must have seen that today a survey of cleanliness is also going on.
Earlier, the report of the situation of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country once surveyed three cities.
Now there are more than 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population and this gives birth to a belief in every city that let's go, brother, we have lagged behind but we will do something better in the coming days.
Cleanliness has become an atmosphere of competition.
I hope that all of us can contribute to this campaign as much as we can.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji.
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also going on for two years.
I urge you to buy something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time also I urge every family to have some or the other khadi cheese so that the light of Diwali can be lighted in the house of the poor.
When this is the second October, as a citizen, how can we connect ourselves to the work of cleanliness
If there is video then send video .
If this movement will get a new strength and a new pace will be achieved once again by our efforts in the entire country.
Let us pledge to do something or the other for the country by remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
And I have seen that whenever I said to leave gas subsidy in the past, and the response that the countrymen gave is a very inspiring event of Indias national life.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the shares and used to seek the old sports that the families used to donate and those who used to donate them to the Anganwadis of the poor areas.
Looking at the miraculous joy of seeing yellow plays for those poor children, it would be like a car
The work of describing the political ideologies of millions of workers like me, the party of politics associated with India's roots, the ideologies of India's cultural heritage, the year of the centenary of Pandit Deendayal ji, who gave a political philosophy, a united human philosophy, is beginning today.
Sarvajan Hitaya - Sarvajan Sukhya Antyodaya's theory is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor get the fruits of development
He had given full economic agenda to every hand, to every field, to every field, to every field in two words.
We can make the country free from poverty only when the country celebrates its birth centenary as a poor welfare year, the focus of the governments of the society and the benefits of development of the poor is focused on it.
As a part of this, the Prime Minister's residence and the road known as the Rescross Road of the British today has been named as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on the occasion of birth centenary year of Lok Kalyan Marg.
This is a reflective form of the poor welfare year of this century.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
In this, I have been making an honest effort that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to enhance the quality of government works.
How the people of this country are inspiring me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way Mann Ki Baat has admired it, the way it has improved it, the way it has blessed it.
I am also grateful to Akashwani, who has not only spread these words but also tried to bring it to all languages.
I am also grateful to the people of the country who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat, suggested the window of the government and threw light on the errors of the government and Akashwani made a special programme on these letters, by calling the representatives of the government and providing a platform for the solution of problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, but it is becoming a new opportunity for society to change.
For anybody what is the other reason for its greater satisfaction
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navaratri and Durga Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi and the preparations for Diwali are a different kind of atmosphere throughout the country.
It is a festival of comfortable prayer and the unity of the society can only be achieved by the country.
Then it should be Navratri, how should the festival of Durga Puja , the prayer of that Shakti , the prayer of the unity of the society
How to make the festival connecting humans and humans
And only when it becomes the means of realization, we can celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let us take the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Hockey's magician Dhyan Chand ji tomorrow on 2nd August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I would like to remind you of his contribution.
He played a crucial role in giving Hockey gold medal to India in the 128th, 132th, in the 136th Olympic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lovers, breadmen.
He said for Dhyan Chand ji, he is a living example of Gol Like Runs, Dhyan Chand ji Sportsman Spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, a opponent team player hockeyed Dhyan Chand ji's head.
At that time, there was only 10 minutes left to end the match.
And Dhyanchand ji had made it three rounds in ten minutes and said, I turned the wounds into change.
But I have seen that this time, everybody urged me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I see it positively that the common man's engagement with the Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the country's eldest Prime Minister.
Besides Cricket, there is so much love for the citizens and sports of India.
Reading this message for me has become a cause of inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra Modi App. Please speak to girls at Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports because they have made the country proud to win medals at Rio Olympics.
Somebody writes that you have requested that this time mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat.
The medals we received were given by these girls.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not descend from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India and one is from South India and some is from East India.
So somebody is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India are proud of the name of the country.
On Mai Gov, Summit Thakur has written that we could perform well in the Olympics.
He wrote, Honble Modi sir, first of all congratulated the two medals we won in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that our performance was really good
And the answer is - no.
We need to cut a lot of distance in sports.
Our parents still ask to pay attention to learning.
In the society, sports are still considered to be a hunt of time.
We need to change this idea.
The society needs inspiration.
Thus thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot exhibit our hopes.
It has also happened that the exhibition that our sportspersons showcased in India could not even reach there.
And only two medals could be obtained in the medal coach.
But it is true that even after not getting medals, if you look carefully then for the first time in many sports, Indias sportspersons have shown great skills.
But why can we forget this one thing that it is the first Indian daughter to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic Finals
The same happened in some tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar quolifyed the track field final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women's hockey team reached the Olympics.
Sportspersons of India, the time to come will definitely be good for us.
Many sportspersons, entries, Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do what we have done then we will be restless again.
I have announced a committee.
We will make a work map of how we can do better.
He thinks that the kingdom likes one or two sports and plans for how he can perform excellent exhibition in it.
I also urge the federations associated with sports associations that they should also be psychopathized in a neutral manner.
And I urge every citizen in India to send me a suggestion on the Narendra Modi App whichever is interested in it.
Write to the government.
The association will discuss and give its request to the government.
State Governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
But we should fully prepare and I am confident that we have to move forward with a resolution to achieve a better position in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September is the Teachers Day.
I have been spending a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for several years.
But if we want to go for the G-20 Summit for this time, then I got it that today I will express my feelings about Mann Ki Baat.
The teachers have the same place as the mother has in life and we have seen teachers who have more concern than their own students.
He dedicates his life to his disciples, to his students.
Nowadays, after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
They are sportspersons but they have presented a vibrant example of what is a good teacher.
Today, I see Gopichand ji as a best teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
Teacher's contribution to our brother's life is always felt.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Sarvapalli is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates it as Teachers Day.
He may have reached any place in his life, but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he used to say that good teachers are those who never die of their inner students.
Despite being the President's post, to live as a teacher and to keep the inner student alive on being a teacher's mind - such a wonderful life was shown by Dr. Radhakrishnaji.
I think I remember a lot of things from my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say with joy that one of my teachers is now at the age of 70 years, even today their letters come to me every month.
And because of this, if I see any good letters then I have a feeling of respect.
It will be a pride and it is the responsibility of all of us to enhance the pride of our teachers in society.
You must present your photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if you have any inspirational point with your teachers.
Look, seeing the contribution of teachers in the country with the eyes of students is also very valuable.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will come in a few days.
We all want our country, our society, our family, the life of every individual to remain undisclosed.
But when we talk about the Ganesh festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of Public Ganesh Festival is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, public Ganesh Festivals have started taking place.
Restricted competitions, colourful competitions.
His exhibition also highlights the issues that touch the society very artisticly.
This big campaign of public education is being run by the Public Ganesh Festival.
Surajya is our right to birth, we should now move forward towards Surajya, we should become our priority - we cannot send a message on this mantra through the Public Ganesh Festival
Come, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are capable of society.
This time, many people have sent me to Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja by writing a lot.
Why do not use the idol of Ganeshji made of the soil of the village pond
Statues made of POP are not uncomfortable for the environment.
Conserving the environment, protecting our rivers and rivers, protecting these small animals of water from pollution. This is also God's service.
Ganesh ji is a great leader.
We should not create Ganeshji who produces a buzz.
I don't know how you will take this thing in my form, but I don't just say it, many people say it and I have heard about many things - a artist is Shriman Abhijit Ghondfale.
An environment friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
Durga Puja is still time.
Just now we decide that the old family that makes idols.
If we buy a statue from them then they will also get employment and if these statues are made from the soil of the pond or river then they will get it again.
I extend my best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madhur Teresa will be divided by saints on 4th September.
Madhur Teresa dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of the saints when Madhur Teresa, who has served the poor people of India throughout their life.
In the event to be held on 4th September, the Government of India will also send an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of 1.
From the saints, from the saints, from the great men, every moment we get to learn something or the other.
Let us achieve something or the other, learn and keep doing something better.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a big change.
Janash Kita is considered to be God's form.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the help of five State Governments for clean Ganga and for cleaning Ganga.
On 20th of this month, the Sarpanchs of the village on the banks of Ganga were invited to Allahabad.
The village does not allow the river Ganga to be dirty and no one has come from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
Some people came from Uttar Pradesh, some people came from Bihar, some people came from Jharkhand and some people came from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this imagination. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by connecting the peoples power.
My dear countrymen, some things ever touch me and those who have their imagination also have a special respect in my mind.
On July 15, more than seventy-seven thousand school students collectively wrote letters to their parents in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh.
This was done by children of seven to seventy years of age.
Congratulations to those students who have made this effort and special congratulations to those parents who have decided to make their children's letter seriously and toilets.
There are things that inspire us.
A sixteen-year-old daughter Mallamma respected Satyagraha against her family in Koppal district of Karnataka.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a pledge.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
But everybody is associated with it in some form or the other, everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and has urged the people to make a film on cleanliness for two minutes, three minutes and send a short film to the Government of India.
You will get details on the website.
It will be contested and the winners will be rewarded on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I also tell the channels that you also invite the competition for such films.
Creativeity - creativity can also give a strength to the Swachhta Mission.
New ways will be known, new motivation will be inspired and all this will be done by common artists with the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be big studio and good cameras to make films.
A very important thing has happened in the past.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - Now some people will have to inaugurate a radio channel to the President
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, Akashwani Friendship and Bangladesh Betar will share their commodities and Bangladeshi people from both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
I also thank Bangladesh for joining us for this work.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani that they are also contributing to foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even though you have given me the work of enormous Prime Minister, I believe in the same way as you people.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also provide new energy and inspire new motivations and that is what inspires the people of the window to leave something or the other.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my heart.
A 84-year-old mother who is a retired teacher wrote this letter to me.
If he had never forbidden me to declare my name in this letter then today I would have spoken to his name.
In the letter, he wrote that whenever you appealed to leave gas subsidy, I had left subsidy and then I had forgotten.
Friends, You must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my delegates will send a letter to him by going to Rubru.
My efforts are to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing well and the campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of smoke is excellent and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not about fifty thousand rupees but it is a mother's feeling and it is the blessings of Kotikoti mothers and sisters that gives confidence and strength for the future of my country.
I salute that mother and salute the Kotikoti mothers of India who always wish somebody by suffering themselves.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to weather but this August month was constantly filled with floods.
There were floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments could do as much as the central governments, the local self-reliance units, the social institutions and the citizens.
But among these flood news, there were also some such news that needed to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, what a big result can be achieved if we walk together, this year will be remembered for the month of August.
In August 2016, all these political parties together passed the GST Bill by simultaneous opposition parties, non-opposite parties and nearly 0 parties from all over the country, even in the Parliament.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country talked about Kashmir in a single voice.
If you have said it in the least words then I would say that unity and mamta - these two things are in the original mantra, and we all have the opinion of 1. 25 billion people, from the Sarpanch of the village to the elderly, it is the opinion that if anyone dies in Kashmir, it is a young man or a security worker, it is ours, it is our own people, it is our country's people who are trying to make these children unrest in Kashmir, sometimes they have to answer the innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
It is the responsibility of all of us as a citizen, as a society, as a government to bind a diverse country in the binding of unity that if we put more emphasis on unity and bring it out then the country will make its bright future.
I believe in the success of millions of countrymen.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
This morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youngsters of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will fill every youngster with enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports event is going to be held.
The word Rio will echo in our ears.
The whole world will play.
Every country in the world will keep an eye on the exhibition of its sportspersons.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have gone to play in Rio, the zeal of sportspersons is for the 125 crore Indians.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organized Run for Rio, Khelo Our Jio, Khelo Our Khilo an excellent event.
What should we do for the promotion of our sportspersons wherever we are in the coming days
There is so much interest in eating, but everything has to be left.
Even if there is a sweet sleep in the winter, we have to leave the bed and run in the field and not only for the sportsperson but also his parents.
Players don't become night and night.
I am also ready to do this work on behalf of you.
To deliver your message to these sportspersons, the country is ready to become a major postal stamp.
Let us all be proud of the sportspersons in the coming days. Let us enhance their efforts as much as we can.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poem lover Punjab Central University student Suraj Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
There may be many other poets who have sent poems, perhaps they will write poems and some will make them voice.
Technologies are changing everyday, take new forms everyday, create new effects everyday, keep changing.
You cannot catch technology.
If there is no research and innovation then the way water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a boss.
And if we continue to be confident of research and innovation without an old technologies, then we will emerge in the changing era of the world and therefore we will have to promote the spirit of science attraction, research and innovation towards technology in the new generation.
Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One objective is to create an ecosystem, innovation, experiment, entrepreneurship, through the Atal Innovation Mission across the country through this AIM.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre (Innovation Centre) has a direct connection with innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre, then the government is thinking of providing a huge amount of Rs.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And the Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the young generation of the country to find solutions to the problem you see with the help of technology, research, innovate and solve.
The Government of India seeks to promote the discovered technologies for resolving our problems by giving special awards.
And I am glad that people are interested in the matter that when we talked about the Tinking Lab, about thirteen thousand schools applied and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that the true tribute to Abdul Kalam ji - Research, Innovation will work as much as our new generation to solve the problems of our daily life, to simplify our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worrying about the drought and today the rain is also enjoying, the news of the flood is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are making a lot of effort to help the flood victims.
Even though there are some problems due to rains, everyone's mind, every human mind gets filled up because our entire economic activity is at the centre of rains- agriculture.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us tired throughout our life.
But if we remain awakened, be cautious and are striving then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
Dengue was the only one.
Dengue can be avoided.
Concentrate on a little hygiene, be a little cautious and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and such a disease occurs in the poor population is ideological but the case of dengue does not come.
Dengue comes first in the prosperous areas and therefore we understand it.
You will be watching the public news on TV, but sometimes we are somewhat sad in taking care of it.
The government, the hospital, the doctor will not only do our job but also we will not enter the dengue in our households, in our area, in our family and I will be cautious about the illness caused by water.
I would like to pay attention to another problem, dear countrymen.
Life has become so busy and has become so busy that we do not have time to think for us.
If you have fallen sick then you feel like getting alright at the earliest and for this we take any antibiotic in the body .
But the bacteria that are their bacteria are tampered with these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then they spend years in fighting, making new medicines, scientific discovery etc. and till then these diseases create a new problem.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing such a change in itself very carefully that medicines do not have any effect on it .
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is necessary to follow the rules of use of antibiotics.
I would like to add one more thing when we are talking about health.
Though there has been a reduction in the mortality rate of mothers in the last decade, even today a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or after deficiency of blood , delivery related infections , high BP , do not know what difficulty will make his life ruined .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, all pregnant women will be treated free of cost at Government Health Centres on 9th of every month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give this work for the poor for 12 days in a year
In the past, I have written many letters.
Thousands of doctors have stepped up following my point of view.
But India is such a big country that lakhs of doctors should join this campaign.
I am sure you will definitely add.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been stressed in India for centuries.
During the war of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, "Swashtha: Sarva Vrikshana" means I bloom in all trees.
It is said in the Shukracharya Policy - Nasti Maul Anushadh - there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal quality.
The Anushan Parv of the Mahabharata - it has been discussed in many detail in it and it has been said that the tree that plants is a son-in-law for it.
There's no doubt.
The tree that donates it wires in the world like a son.
A few days ago, one example of a daughter Sonal of Pune came to me - it touched my heart.
It is said in the discipline festival of the Mahabharata that trees also fulfill the responsibility of children in the world, not only their parents, but also to fulfill the wishes of the society as if they have raised their bills.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, married his daughter Sonal in a very inspiring way.
And when I saw his picture in the social media, it was surprising that even if there were no lives in marriage, the plants were visible all around.
The scene of the Tasvir was heartbreaking.
In a way, the marriage of Sonal became an immortal story of nature love and I congratulate Sonal and Mr. Mahatrejee for this innovative effort.
And many people use it.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of travellers visit the Ambaji Temple in the month of Bhadrava.
And I will tell them that look, this is the prasad of Mother and if this plant goes to your village and makes it big then the mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of travellers used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting instead of prasad in this rainy season.
One can become a simple mass movement - tree plantation.
I have repeatedly told the farmer brothers that if we ruin our land on the banks of our fields then why should not we cultivate timber instead of that harvest
If we plant such trees on the banks of our fields which are furniture and households, then it can be sold by cutting it by the permission of the government after fifteen-twenty years.
And you can also become a new source of income and India can also escape from importing timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan - Desert - has celebrated such a big forest and has pledged to plant twenty five lakh plants.
Twenty five lakh plants are not small in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big they have picked up.
Andhra Pradesh has also pledged to increase its green cover by 50.
The Government of India has launched the Green India Mission under which the Railways has accelerated this work.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Martyr Forest have been taken up in the form of Van Mahotsav in Gujarat and have launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they are also eligible for congratulations.
But my journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage in a way.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness fall in the world, then the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela are swimming.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Phinix Settlement and was known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence Sarvodaya.
I also got the privilege of the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train that had laid the foundation stone of a Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi was Peter Maritzburg Station.
But I have got the opportunity to meet such dignitaries who have lost their lives for equality and equal opportunities, who fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela.
For twenty-twenty-two years, Nelson spent his life with Mandela in jail.
In a way, he had invited the entire young man and I was fortunate to visit the close friends of Nelshan Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Kathada, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Bezori, Ronnie Casaries.
The responsibilities of the duties described in the Gita appeared to be absolutely evident.
My heart will remember that visit forever.
Equality and equal opportunities cannot be a mantra for any society and government.
Priority will be different, but the path is the same and that path is development, equality, equality, equality, emotionality.
Let us be proud of our Indians who have shown the basic mantras of our life in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Verma.
Those who have given me a message and their concern is very natural.
I am saddened by her family due to being a woman.
And some people become confused and get stuck in the fascination of money.
A new method of looting through this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments he came to know that everything has been looted.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
Artificial paintings are drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then you must see the station.
Today, I am getting such news from several railway stations of India that the local people are presenting their identification on the walls of the railway stations through their art.
There is an innovation.
This is an example of how peoples participation can change.
Congratulations to all those who do this kind of work in the country and special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
And you will also be attending the festival at home and outside.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan has a special significance.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan this year, can not you give the mothers and sisters of your country the Vada Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Imagine, give such gifts to sisters that will give them the right protection in their lives.
And today is social security.
Today the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan is.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who is born in a free India.
The entire country will be colored in the color of the heroes of freedom, the fragrance of freedom on all sides should once again be felt that this environment should be created by all of us and that the Freedom Festival should not be a programme of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will do something or the other associated with the inspiration of patriotism.
Whatever you want, your talk should also be kept from the Red Fort with such a swiftness.
And nowadays, the technology platform is so easy that you can easily send things to me.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programmes during the holidays.
And in the holidays there is also a season of mango, so it also feels like enjoying mango.
And sometimes it feels that if you get a chance to sleep for a while in the afternoon then it is better.
But the horrible heat of this time has enjoyed all around.
But I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is seen in many villages and what is the value of water, it is only those who have suffered from water.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water and there is activity to do something.
A few days ago somebody had told me that the Haiver of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra, the Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers there have taken water as a very sensitive question of the village.
We have decided to leave the cultivation of such crops, whether it is sugarcane or banana.
It looks very simple to hear but it is not so easy.
And all of them went on the farming of horticulture and vegetables that require water at least.
They have taken all such initiatives such as fountains, drop irrigation, rain water conservation and water conservation that today the village has emerged on its own strength to deal with the water crisis.
Well, I am talking about a small village of Bajar, but there will be several such villages.
I also express my gratitude to all such villagers for their excellent work.
Somebody told me that there is a Gorava Gram Panchayat in Deos district of Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has tried to make fertilizers by making efforts.
However, water was saved but when the water level comes up, the quality of water also improves.
Sometimes it seems that when the Government of India has delivered water to Latur by train, it has become a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the railways have done this work is eligible for congratulations but the people of Pela village are also eligible for congratulations.
I would like to say that more congratulations are eligible than the railways.
However, many such schemes that are being run by the citizens never come to the fore.
The person has a habit of passing through many difficulties, but if there is a good news then he feels as if the entire crisis has gone away.
This year, the possibility of rainfall from 106 to 110 has been reported as if a message of great peace has come to light.
Till now it is time to get rains but news of good rains has also brought a new warning.
The more enjoying the news that it will be good rains, it also gives us a chance, it also throws a challenge.
Can we run a campaign from now on to save the village water
Farmers need soil and they work to grow crops in the field.
This time why do not we take soil out of the ponds of the village in the fields .
It will also improve the field land and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Whenever the cement bags are filled in empty bags of fertilizers, rocks and soil, wherever the water is going to be stopped or not
If water stops for five days, water stops for seven days, then the water will come down to the ground, then the water level will be raised in the ground.
Our wells will have water.
The water should be stopped as much as possible.
We have time for one and a half months in the next month, even if it is a water crisis or a drought situation.
And I always say that whenever we go to the birth place of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, one of the different places we want is to see that in order to save the rain water, there are hundreds of years old tanks built under the house and how pure water remains in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
It is very natural for the crores of people of the country such as Bhai Kumarkrishna to raise this question.
Ganga is a Mokshadevi for those who have religious faith.
I will accept this Mahatma but more than that I feel that the Ganga is life-saving.
The Ganga gives us employment and gives us a new strength to live.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new impetus to the economic activities of the country.
We have brought a Bhagirath by bringing it to the Ganges but crores of Bhagiraths are required to save it.
This work cannot be successful without public participation.
And that's why we all have to be a representative of cleanliness, a transformation, a repeated talk, a repetition.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to cooperate with the states that have been built on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent supplies of button and industrial pollution.
Everyday, in large quantities of drains, solid waste flows and is placed inside the Ganges.
In order to clean such waste, the trash scheme works to clean the waste in water at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been supplied to all the local self-reliance institutions and are urged to keep them running continuously and clean the waste from there.
And in the past, I have been told that there is a very good effort and there is a daily waste of three to 11 tons.
The pulp and paper industry which has almost stopped the waste or blacklicker emissions.
All this indicates that we are moving forward in the right direction and awareness is also increasing.
And I have seen that if a person is found not only on the banks of the Ganges but also on the far-flung south then he definitely says that if the Ganga is cleaned then it will happen
So this is the belief of the common man that will definitely succeed in cleaning the Ganga.
People are also donating Ganga for cleanliness.
This system is being run very well.
My countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated in India as Panchayati Raj Day.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system in the entire country is successfully working as an important unit of our democratic system.
And that is why in collaboration with the State Governments, the Government of India launched Bharatodaya campaign from 14th April to 24th April, 10th day from Gramodaya.
And today on 24th, I will celebrate the Panchayati Raj Divas in Jharkhand where our maximum tribal brothers and sisters live.
And once again on the occasion of Panchayati Raj Day at 3 pm, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country.
This campaign has done a big job of awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the village level in every corner of India
How should the village itself become self-reliant
How does the village plan its own development
Daughter's birthday should be celebrated in the village.
There are several such schemes.
In some villages there were food donation programs.
In all these villages of India, perhaps there is a very little time that such programmes have been running for 10 days together.
I congratulate all the State Governments, the Sarpanchs of the villages for this thing.
In a very fundamental way, with innovation, this whole opportunity has been transformed into an opportunity for the welfare of the village, for the development of the village and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India's rise.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharma Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
For the past several years, there has been a need to improve the education sector.
Like not sufficient schools or colleges or quality in education.
Today, if there is a dream of parents in every family then it is a good education for children.
Housing, car, everyone thinks later.
And the feeling of the people's mind for a country like India is a great strength.
There should be anxiety of learning and learning good education to children, and there should be greater awareness.
And the child also becomes aware that I go to school for this work.
And that is why I would first urge all the parents to interact in detail with the child about the activities in the school.
And if something is taken into consideration then you should go to school and talk to the teachers.
This opportunity can also reduce many evils from our education system.
So, in a way, the effort to spread education all around was a priority.
And that was also necessary.
But the greater importance that we have to spread is to improve our education.
We have done a big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
From the Literacy Campaign, we have to make good education a priority.
Entrance, Entrance, Entrance - Mantras have been consistently scattered, but now the children who have reached the school will have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the present government's budget too.
Efforts are being made to stress on good education.
But Sharma ji's point is true that we need to bring about reforms from dharma.
This time in the budget, you must have seen that the work has been done with cheese chatti.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten private universities have been asked to get rid of government dams and come on a challenging road. Let us tell what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been initiated with the intention of giving them full freedom.
Universities of India can also become globally competitive universities.
At the same time, the more important is education, the more important is skill.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Far away education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that the results will be visible in the near future.
People have been asking me on one subject for a long time.
Some people write on the web portal Mai Gov.
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi App and most of them write this young man.
In today's era, sports is also of great importance for the youth as well as for studies.
So one day I also had that I should talk to you people before that I should talk to you all.
As a result, I have just called a meeting in which NCC was elderly, NSS elders, Scouts and Guides were from Red Cross, Nehru was from the Youth Centre.
And when I asked them when they had met earlier then they said that this kind of first meeting has been held after the independence of our country.
I have got that benefit in childhood only and I believe that these organizations should supplement a new life and irrigate a new strength.
This time I have put some topics in front of them.
I have told them that brothers, why should not our youth and all organizations do a big job of water conservation in this season
Which programmes can be built to connect the country
What can be the common youth singing of all our organizations
What new things can be added to their work style, programme
If you will write on my Narendra Modi app, then I will bring it to the right place.
Such a situation will become.
My dear countrymen, today I have told you that we are forced to think about it.
I also see it as a matter of shocking people.
You must have seen that the political situation in our country is such that in the last few elections, many people used to discuss how many cylinders would be given to the party
And every political party felt that if the middle class had to reach the society with the point of view of election then it was a big issue of gas bottle.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize that subsidies should be reduced.
And because of this, several committees used to sit in which there were very big proposals for reducing gas subsidy.
These committees used to spend crores of rupees.
But the thing used to stay there.
This is the experience of everyone.
But it was never thought outside.
My countrymen, I am glad to give my account to all of you today that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy layer.
But after calculating, it was known that more than 80 per cent of these one crore families were those who themselves driven the distributors there, stood in the queue and gave them their subsidy in writing.
This incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if it happens to the world's economists then they will do the same, then they will be the result of the economic integration.
For them too, the limits of their thoughts are external and somebody has to think about it.
I would especially urge the entire political class to say that we must do one thing that trusts the people everywhere.
You have never thought that we will get such results.
And we should go in this direction.
Trust those who are sending their exams and sending Marcus.
Sometimes, I also feel that we should declare that there will be no ticket checker in the route of the railway penny today.
Every newspaper and News Channel have bad news.
Is there no goodness around us in a country with a population of Rs.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive newspapers were printed on the first page of the newspaper.
He used to keep talking about this.
A few days ago, a newspaper had also written to me, he said that we have decided that we should not give a single negative news on Monday.
Good news becomes the biggest cause of motivation.
It is true that as much as we force goodness, the place will be less for our evils.
If we light the lamps then darkness will be removed, it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi ji has made a good suggestion but please do not get angry with me.
Let us all try to make positive together and try to speak positively.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people of the world will know that crores of people will come on the banks of the river for a long time.
For the last two days, I have been seeing that many people are uploading the pictures of Singhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the State Government to compete with it.
Photo competition, and tell people to upload you with beautiful photographs.
And people will also know how much diversity is happening in the corners of the Kumbh.
So it can definitely be done.
It is true that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh had met me and he used to say that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that there is cleanliness.
From there people will also take a message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela may be a religious and spiritual fair, but we can make it a social opportunity.
We should do this Kumbh Mela how to increase the love of water, how to increase the faith of water, how to use this Kumbh Mela to give a message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, on this important day of Panchayati Raj, I will meet you once again in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book on the conversations of Premchand ji and we had decided that I will share some things with everyone through the NarendraModi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have distributed information about books.
I am happy that people are discussing and discussing books on various subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade, lifestyle.
Well, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to admit that I cannot give much time to read books now.
But one of the benefits is that if you have written and sent me then I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But on the experience of the last month, I feel that we have to move forward.
Why should we make a permanent book's corner general on the NarendraModiApp and whenever we read new books, write there and discuss it.
And you can also suggest a good name for our books corner.
I want this book's corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
You keep reading, write and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made in water conservation across the country.
People are telling about traditional methods and methods.
Media also has a lot of innovations on water conservation.
Be it the government or the NGOs, all are doing something or the other at war level.
Considering the capabilities of collectiveness, the mind is feeling very happy and very satisfied.
Just like Jharkhand, just a distance from Ranchi, in Ara Karam village of Ormanji block, the enthusiasm that the villagers have shown about water management has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that ISAN India's beautiful state Meghalaya has become the first state in the country that has prepared its water policy- water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crop cultivation is encouraged in which less water is required and the farmers also do not have any harm.
I especially congratulate the Government of Haryana for interacting with the farmers and inspired them to remove them from traditional farming and for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why should we not use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and especially the achievements of the children, their valour, gives us new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children. And these children are - Nidhi Bypotu, Monish Joshi, Deenshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tivari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguly and Hritik Ala-Manda.
Whatever I say about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is scared.
It seems that death is standing at the door, but all these ten children have defeated not only dangerous diseases like cancer in their lives, but with their valour, India's name has emerged all over the world.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports competition in which the Young Cancer Surveyor i.e. those who come out with cancer in their lives participate.
The competition was organised like shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of these sportsmen won medals in more than one sports.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in the space and in the space - I speak of Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjeev Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Arvindrao, from different parts of the country, many people have written to me on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the space vision 2019 has been very good for India.
Our scientists left A-SAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
In the race for elections, big and important news such as A-SAT could not be discussed at that time.
We have achieved the capability of breaking the satellite in just three minutes from A-SAT missile, 300 km away.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire country saw it with pride that Chandrayaan-2 took its steps from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two major teachings I have received from Chandrayaan 2, then I will tell you that these are two teachings - Faith and Firelessness i.e. faith and fearlessness.
We must trust our talents and capacities, we must believe in our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
It is Indian in terms of purpose and emotion.
It is completely a indigenous mission.
The way our scientists have launched Chandrayaan-Bey in a record time and day-night by fixing all technological problems.
The whole world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary satellites in our lives, but always remember that we have the capability to overcome them.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we look forward to the month of September when lander Vikram and rover-pragya will be descended on the moon's surface.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition with the students of the country, young friends and invite the youngsters of the country for a quiz competition.
Space-related gynaecology, India's space mission, science and technology will be the main topics of this uiz Competition, such as what to do to leave the rocket.
How the satellites are set up in classes and what information we get from the satellites, what is A-SAT, there are many things.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially urge schools, girls, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
Encouraging all the students to join them and the most thrilling thing is that the Government of India will take the highest qualification students from every state to Sriharikota at its cost and in September they will get the opportunity to be a witness to the moment when Chandrayaan is descending on the lunar surface.
This will be a historic event of their lives for the victorious students.
But for this, you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to get the most marks, you will have to succeed.
Friends, My suggestion must have given you a pleasant opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have noticed one thing.
Our minds have accelerated the cleanliness campaign from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, is setting up new standards for cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal position in sanitation, but the way the Swachhta Abhiyan has been successful from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolution of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen but we do not have to stop from this.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was talking about Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is a soldier engineer and left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharati.
He has not only made Delhi clean, but also made it beautiful a while ago.
He started with his team from the wastes of Lodhi Garden.
Through the street art, several areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of over bridges and schools to the slums, they started carving their swords, they got the support of the people and this order started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh.
I came to know that brother Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in it.
Whether there is no sound in colors and lines, but the message of Indradhanush that is made of it proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of making waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making waste stretch.
My dear countrymen, I read a very interesting drop on MyGov in the past.
This comment was from Mohammad Aslam, brother living in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: He likes to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to note that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in the month of June.
I feel that such programmes should be organized every three months.
At the same time, online monitoring of the programme should also be arranged.
I think that was the first such programme in which people interacted directly with the government.
My eagerness to know about the Back to Village programme after reading the message sent by brother Mohammad Aslam ji increased and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the entire country should also be aware of it.
This programme shows how much the people of Kashmir are eager and enthusiastic to connect with the mainstream of development.
This programme lasted for a week and in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, government officials informed the people of the village about the details of government schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of the common man even the people of the village showed their problems unconsciously
Friends, It was not merely known in this programme that the officers would return to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in Panchayat and they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
To make this programme interesting, several other things have also been included.
Under Khelo India, sports competitions for children were organized.
Sports kits, MNREGA job cards and SC-ST certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became participants in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village programme was also organised in remote villages where government officials had to travel for one day and a half days while climbing the mountains through inaccessible roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, which are always in the surroundings of bullets across the border and not only did the officers reach the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgram and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in the villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in this show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance, this also proves that the power of development is always heavy on the strength of the bomb-bank.
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create obstacles, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, has presented something like this in one of his poems the month of Shravan month.
In this poem, he said. That is, the binding of rainy season and water stream is unique and the earth is enchanted by seeing its beauty.
In the entire India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate the Shravan month in their own way.
Whenever we see around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered green sheets.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is also a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
When you are talking about the month of Shravan, you will be very happy to know that this time the maximum number of devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave from 1st July till now.
Moreover, the number of pilgrims who were involved in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015 has been included in only 28 days this time.
I would like to appreciate the success of Amarnath Yatra, especially the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Anyone who returns from the journey becomes admirer of the spirit of joy and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that in Uttarakhand this year, since the commencement of Chardham Yatra, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the terrible disaster in 2013, for the first time, such record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to you all that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty blooms very much during the monsoon season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no other teacher than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Shravan transmits new energy, new hopes and new aspirations to all of you.
Similarly, the month of August reminds of uit India.
However, when we see on TV, we see one side of the rains - floods, frozen water, traffic jam on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I also have the same concern as you are concerned about your children's examination.
But if we change our ways to look at the examination then perhaps we can become anxiety free.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I have said that I am happy to send you your experience and your suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers, the parents and some thinkers of the society have written and sent me a lot of things.
I will also talk about what I have read and what I have heard.
I would also like to be amongst what I think.
I would like to listen to the message he has sent to the youngsters of India who are proud of...
You must work hard, but set a real goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I used to play cricket, I had greater expectations than me.
So it was very important for me to find a solution.
So I thought that I would look forward to myself and fulfill my goal.
But I am fulfilling the goal of my self and fulfilling it, I am definitely doing something or the other good for the country.
And I used to always try to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speaking and the goal was gradually achieved by itself.
I would like to tell you that it is very important for you to have positive ideas.
Why is competition
Why not compete
Why should we ruin our time to compete with others
Why should we not compete with ourselves
Why should we not decide to break all our old records
You shoes, no one will stop you moving forward.
And whenever you break your old records, you will have no hope for joy, satisfaction, no one will have a lot of satisfaction.
Friends, Do not consider the exams a game of data.
Don't be stuck in the accounts of what to reach and what to reach.
Life should be linked to a great objective.
We should walk with dreams and be determined.
Whether these exams are being realized or not, we calculate whether our speed is correct or not.
And that is why if the dreams are vast and vast then the exam will become a joyous festival.
Every exam will be a step to fulfill this great objective.
Every success will become the key to fulfilling that great objective.
And do not remain confined to what will happen this year and what will happen in such examinations.
Let us go with a big goal and if anything remains less than expected then there will be no disappointment.
And there will be greater courage to try.
Thousands of people have written to me smaller things from mobile phones on my app.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that a healthy mind remains in a healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, also take care of your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now on the last day, I would not say that you should start penalties and go for three kilometers and five kilometers to run.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of examination, how is your daily routine
Our 365 days of day-to-day should be in line with our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with one of the words of Shri Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has specially urged that he should sleep on time and should be revised by whale awake in the morning.
After taking entrance cards and other things at the examination center one should reach before time .
This is what Prabhakar Reddy Ji has done, I do not hesitate to say because I am slightly sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
And this is possible.
I don't talk about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is a slight distress in our body and a single part of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also becomes distracted.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You don't have yourself in the habit of compromising with the shoes, which are certain.
Decide, look.
Friends, I have seen sometimes that the students who go for examination have two kinds of students.
You must have seen these two kinds of students.
If anybody can do this thing better than me, then whoever is the master of check-up and who has checked the world's largest sportsperson.
The Champion Viswanathan Anand of Teva Chase will tell his experience.
Let us learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, I am Vishwanathan Anand, first of all, greetings on your exams and start my speech.
I will talk about the exams and its experiences I have given.
After the examinations, the problems in life are like that.
When you play, you don't know what positions will be there now, even in the classes you don't know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have taken enough sleep then the true answer that will give you the brain at that moment.
So stay calm.
It is very important that you do not put too much pressure on yourself, do not keep too much expectations.
Look at this as a challenge - I remember what I have been taught during the year, I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, the topics that you do not remember properly, pass through important things.
You can recall some details with teachers or students which will help you in writing in the examination.
If you repeat the questions you seem difficult then it will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write about it in a better way in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take sufficient sleep, do not be very confident, and there is no depression, there is a fear in the beginning but I can successfully cross these tests.
Therefore, take full faith in the nature.
Vishwanathan Anand has actually spoken very important.
Sometimes we heard the event of Arjun's life - how his eyes were on the eyes of the birds.
If you are despairing, you are pushing the deceitful books in the last moments, then your mind cannot calm down.
Laugh, let's laugh, let's say jokes with friends, let's see, it will create an atmosphere of peace.
You should imagine that you are standing in a pond and you can see very beautiful things below the pond.
But suddenly if a stone throws in some water and vomits starts in water then what would be the beautiful things that were seen in the lake
If the water is calm then it is visible that the things are not so deep.
But if the water is uncomfortable then nothing is visible below.
Then I feel that if I don't get a little lighter then I will feel better.
So I have developed my own technology.
This is my experience that you will also be able to work.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my app: We feel light with at least half an hour of friends, with family members. Gapa Mai has told this very important thing because most of us see that whenever we come with the exams, we sit down to calculate how wrong we have done.
We get stuck in it.
Friends, don't do this.
Just come out of it and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji is really a matter of understanding.
Ramcharit Manas, while explaining it in the present context, he is trying to bring this culture to Sarita in the country and in the world.
Such venerable Muraribapu has also sent a very important drop to the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker, and that is why his words are embodied.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy to accept the situation.
In your exams, if you move ahead with a burdenless and happy mind, you will definitely get success and even if you do not get success, there will be no glory to get rid of it and the pride of success will also be there.
I am also grateful to the revered Shri Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I would like to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that the people who have told me their experiences this time have definitely discussed Yoga.
Well, Friends, I will make it clear today that if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning then it will be injustice to you.
But it is true that Yoga is a big chew in the development journey of Antarman, whether it is in student life or in the latter half of life.
Ease of chewing.
Look, if you can.
I have a lot of faith in it.
It's not like that, friends.
But if we read the suggestions then perhaps we suppose that, yes, yes, yes, let's go, I have to go like this.
And I would urge you to read your suggestions even if you go to it for five minutes.
When I read it for the first time, I felt that I did not read it again, but I was noticed that no questions were asked in another way, but this is the same thing that I do not understand the questions, sometimes the question is difficult.
Rao, he has stressed on patience.
In very short words, a very good message has been given to all the students.
Let us listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
He said, "You are from Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
Rao says.
I understand that it is natural to worry due to the examination.
And these are competitive tests.
Don't worry, you do good work.
I say the same to my young friends.
Remember that there are many opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees, you also have the right to be here.
You should have firmness, integrity and penance.
With such quality, you will succeed in every examination and other efforts.
Good Blace, how is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the power of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I thank Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
What they have spoken - Nisthani, Tapni, this is the same thing - dedication, determination, dignity.
If you are busy then you will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now on my app, I have given a message about the experience of the examination right.
He said that in his family, efforts are made to create a positive environment at the time of examination.
This is true that Sachin ji also said that he is a positive approach, a positive framework of mine.
We read in our curriculum on Thomas Elva Edition, the inventor of electricity round.
But friends, how many years it took them to do this thing, how many times it was failing, how much time it has been spent, how much money has been spent, how much disappointment has happened due to failure.
But today the electricity and the bulb illuminates our lives.
It is said that in failure, the chances of success are hidden.
And who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan One of the modern time mathematicians - Indian mathematicians, you will know.
His formal education did not include the subjects of mathematics. He did not have any special training.
But he contributed deeply to various sectors like Methametical Analysis, Number Theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can ever be achieved by anyone.
Hairy Potter category is popular worldwide today, but it did not happen in the beginning.
He had to bear a lot of difficulties.
Roling said that in difficulties, he used to work with full energy which was really important for him.
The examination nowadays happens not only to the students, but also to the entire school and to the teacher.
But the situation is not good for the students to be alone without the help of the vali and the teacher.
If we move forward in a planned manner by forming a unit by making teachers, be it Vali or be it senior students, then the examination becomes easy.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app: He has complained that parents should never put pressure on their children to bring more marks.
They should only be encouraged to prepare.
If the child is talking to his friend then don't stop him.
Create a light environment, create a positive environment, be it your son or daughter, see how much confederation comes.
You can also see that conference.
Friends, One thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends, the life of our people has changed much more than our older generations.
Every moment, new innovations, new technologies and sciences are visible.
And it is not that we are just abhorred.
We like to join it. We also want to go beyond the speed of science.
I am doing this because today is the National Science Day.
The countrys Science Festival is celebrated on 28th February as the National Science Day.
28th February, 128 Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of Raman Effect.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country celebrates 28th February as National Day.
Jigyasa is the people of science.
And without science and technology, new innovation cannot be possible.
Today, on National Science Day, emphasis is on innovation in the country.
Knowledge, Technology, all these things should be a comfortable part of our development journey.
This time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, Sometimes successes are achieved after a long time and when success is achieved, the vision of seeing the world changes.
If you are busy in the examination, you may be able to have a lot of news registered in your mind.
But I would like to tell the countrymen again.
You must have heard that in the past, there has been a big and important discovery in the world of science.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations went on to do something and a success took place after about a hundred years.
The discovery of Gravitational Waves has emerged as a man of our scientists.
This discovery is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein in the last century, but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity will work for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are happy to note that our country's sons were involved in the process of overall research.
Our scientists will continue to strive to further innovation in the future too.
India will also become a participant in international efforts.
And my countrymen, I have made an important decision in the last days.
The government has decided to open Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which is known as Lego, to achieve even more success in this discovery.
The connectivity of India will give this process a new strength and a new momentum.
India will definitely be an active partner in this enhanced scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again, I bow to all the scientists and wish them all the best.
From tomorrow you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by messaging that number.
You will also be able to hear in your mother tongue.
The number of medal calls is 8108-8108 again.
81908-81908 posts, your examination is starting.
I know, hey, brother is the budget tomorrow.
We all celebrated Christmas on the occasion and now the preparations for the New Year's welcome are going on.
India is full of diversity.
In a way every festival goes awaiting another festival.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy runs from festivals.
This becomes the cause of economic activities of the poorer sections of the society.
On behalf of me, my best wishes to all the citizens of Natal and my best wishes to the new year of 2016.
The year 2016 brings all of you a lot of happiness.
May new zeal, new enthusiasm, new determination bring you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Sawleshwarkar has written to me that this weather is the weather of tourists.
A large number of tourists from all over the country come here.
People also go to celebrate Natal's holidays.
The more clean our tourist destinations, India's image will be better in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am delivering the message of Ganesh ji to the people of the country.
And even so, we say that there is a guest who is going to be there.
At the same time, in our tourist destinations, at the devoted places of the tourists, on our pilgrimages, it is indeed a special emphasisable task.
However, they are ordinary artisans and work hard and work hard.
He has done such a unique job that the newspapers have published his words.
And when this thing came to me, I also felt that I had reached you.
In Bhojpura village, he has made 100 toilets so far as he works without his hard work, without his hard work.
I convey my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we listen to the country's disappointment.
And this is the same thing that drives the country forward and it feels very natural for them to take pride for Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the immense efforts of many people that the country is moving forward at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving ahead by one step by one step by one step and the country is also moving forward.
Best education, excellent skills and new opportunities for employment.
It is a big task for the common family to provide easy loans to those who cannot reach the bank windows.
Who can forget that occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna where Balakrishna opened his mouth and made his mother Yashoda see the whole universe.
The event of Yoga has made India feel the same.
The talk of cleanliness is echoing in the household in a way.
Partnership of citizens is also increasing.
The village where electricity pillars reach after so many years of independence, the zeal and zeal that emerges in the darkness of the village, perhaps the people living in the cities who use electricity can never come to us.
I am confident that the media will certainly reach these villages and the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government who are doing this work will be satisfied so much that they have done something that will transform the lives of a village.
Whether it is a farmer or a poor, a young man or a woman, should all these services be reached or not
Therefore, it should not be reached that what government has done and what government has not worked.
But therefore, it should be said that if they are entitled to this thing then they do not let it go.
Should they also get information for getting their rights
We all should try to bring the truth, the good thing, the work of the human being, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this work in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
But I should do something out of what I am doing
A common citizen can also connect with me by downloading the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phones.
And I have been sharing these small things on it.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things.
How can I reach without your help
Let us all come together to bring the interests of the common man to the common man's language and inspire them to get the things of their rights.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India is going to launch the entire Action Plan Action Plan of Startup India, Stand-up India.
And in this programme IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITs, wherever youngsters are there, they will be linked to this programme through Live Connectivity.
Like digital world or IT business, these startups are for them.
No, we have to change it according to the requirement of India.
The market will be available.
Likewise is the intellectual wealth of our youth a little limited to some cities
This thinking is wrong.
Young people should have talent and cheme opportunities in every corner of India.
This Start-up India, Stand-up India should not be limited to some cities.
And I also urge the state governments to take this matter forward.
On January 16, I will definitely be present before you and discuss this in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Whala young friends, is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanandji on 12th January.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanandji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated on 15th to 12th January as the National Youth Festival.
This year, it is scheduled to be held in Rampur, Chhattisgarh from 12 January to 16 January.
And I have come to know that this time they have the theme because their organisation is based on the theme, it is very good. I have been told of the Indian Youth: of Development Skill and Harm that more than 10,000 youngsters will be gathering from all the states and corners of India.
The vision of Youth India is to enhance.
In a way dreams have to be flooded.
There is a feeling of determination.
Can you inform me about this young festival
I especially urge young friends that my Narendra Modi App is.
So I will wait for my friends, to know your ideas about the Youth Festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, a Visual Challenged Teacher of Ahmedabad Gujarat, celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
He gave me a phone call and expressed his feelings and celebrated the Accessible India Jubilee in Sir, and in my school.
We enjoyed the school and inspired the children to help the disabled in the society.
I think it was the first to do with you.
Dilip Ji thanks you very much.
And you are working in this sector yourself.
You understand these things very well and if you give it then you will have a lot of problems.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such a person in the society and sometimes there is some idea in our minds.
We also express our vision of going to them according to our thinking.
And for such people many words have been used in the world but there is always a contemplation towards words.
Every time people feel that no, no, they do not like the identity of this word, they do not like it.
This year when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I had to go to that programme.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu and especially in those districts, I was not able to attend the campaign on that day.
But I had to go to that programme. I had some ideas in my mind.
So at that time I had thought that those who have given some deficiency to the body, who have given some damage to the body, who have done the same work, who are also called disabled and we know as disabled.
But sometimes when we come under their familiarity then it is known that we see a deficiency of them from our eyes but God has given them some special skill.
After that I thought that with eyes we feel that it is disabled, but it feels that it has some extra power specialty.
And then I thought that in our country why not use the word Divyang instead of disabled people
These are the people who have such a part that there are more than one organ in which there is divineity, the transmission of Divya Shakti, which we do not have ordinary body.
I like this word very well.
Can we preach the habit of word Divyang in place of disability, my countrymen
I hope you will take this matter forward.
We have started Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, it will make it easier for the people with disabilities by improving the internal framework both physical and indirect.
Be it a school or a bus station or a railway station or a ramp or a comfortable parking, a comfortable lift, a braille lipi.
They need innovation, technology, system and sensitivity to facilitate availability.
We have taken up this task.
Public participation is also being achieved.
They should not die in the files.
In the past, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of the schemes are easily available to them.
Subsidies are provided in gas cylinders in our country.
The government has made some changes in it.
Be it Jan Dhan Account or Aadhar Card or be it the largest Lorgest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme in the world, which helps the beneficiaries.
This scheme has been known by the name of the initiative and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG users have become the beneficiaries of the Pahal Yojana.
14 crore people have started going directly to the bank accounts.
No intermediaries, no recommendations, no possibility of any corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar card campaign, on the other hand, opening Jan Dhan accounts, on the other hand, the State Government and the Government of India will prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been going directly to the beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
I have a simple estimate that about 35 to 40 schemes are being directly incorporated within the benefit transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a golden moment of Indian Republic Day is also a pleasant coincidence that this time the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the founder of our Constitution.
The Parliament also had a special discussion on the Constitution for two days and had a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs discussed the purity of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the realization of the Constitution etc.
We should move forward this thing.
Can the Republic Day really connect the people with the system
Our Constitution gives us many rights and the officers should be discussed in a social manner and should also be discussed.
But the Constitution also insists on duty.
But it has been seen that the discussion of duty is very low.
Very much when elections are held, there are public news all around, on walls, hoardings are placed or voting is our sacred duty.
At the time of voting, there is a lot of compulsion, but why should not it be compulsory in social life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, can we compete in schools, in colleges, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations, on the subject of duty, competition, poetry competition, speech etc.
If the hundred and fifty crore Indians take one step after another with their duties then how big history can be created.
Can you send it to me
I want to know your ideas.
Send it to me on my portal My Gov.
I would definitely want to know what youngsters think about the duty of my country .
There is a desire to make a small suggestion.
When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, we have the statues of great men in our city, by the citizens, by the children of school colleges.
And this is not what I am waiting for.
As a society, as a country, can we make it our natural nature
On 26th January, all of us should work together to honour the statues of such great men, the cleanliness of the premises, and all this will be easily done by the people and by the citizens.
My best wishes to the countrymen, once again on the New Year 2016.
I would have also got the opportunity to go.
And with new zeal, businesses have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
From every corner of the world, news of natural calamities has been received and there are reports of natural calamities that have never heard or thought.
People are also feeling the impact of climate change at a fast pace.
Many people have died.
I express my condolences and condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are fully working in rescue relief.
The Central Government also works shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
A team of Government of India has just gone to Tamil Nadu.
But whenever we look at all the calamities, we need to bring about a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the Department of Agricultural Disaster because at that time the maximum natural calamity i. e.
Today, its form has changed.
At every level, it has become very important to work for our capacity building.
Governments, civil society, citizens, every small and big institution will have to work for capacity building in a scientific manner.
After Nepal's earthquake, I had spoken to Pakistan's senior Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I suggested to them that we should jointly take a joint action for disaster evacuation by SAARC countries.
I am glad that a tabletok of SAARC countries concluded in the conference and workshop of Exercise Is and Best Practices in Delhi.
A good start.
I have received a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
(I speak from Jalandhar in the Punjab district of Lakhwinder Singh.
We cultivate organic farming here and guide many people.
I was very happy to hear your messages.
Not only this, you are well aware of the problem of farmers.
And your concern is true but it is not just that in Punjab, Haryana.
This is our habit in the entire India and in a traditional way we are on the path to burn the remains of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first step is that we have to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But this is not the truth.
Remains of crops are also very precious.
It is itself a biological fertilizer.
We put it on a vedafi.
Not only this, if small pieces are made of it then it becomes a dry fruit for animals.
Secondly, the upper layer of the ground is burnt due to burning.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, our kidneys are good, everything is good but what will happen if the upper skin of the body burns
Even if the heart continues, it cannot live.
The upper layer of our land burns, which drives our fertile land to death.
And therefore, we should make a positive effort.
This thumb is once again slaughtered into the ground, it becomes fertilizer.
Or if it is poured in a pit and put a little water by putting linseed then it becomes a good kind of biological fertilizer.
Moreover, our land is saved and the fertilizer that is produced in the land is putting in it, it gives double benefits.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated banana.
And he told me a good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate banana and when the banana crop was finished, they had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand rupees per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people carrying it, they did not carry the tractor-bacter, they used to remain lying in the same way.
But some farmers proved that they made six-six, eight-eight-inch pieces of thread and put them on the ground.
The water that is in that knot keeps the crop alive.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with DCABILITIS.
In Mann Ki Baat last time, I discussed the organ donation.
I also discussed Notony's helpline for Organ Donation.
On 2nd November, the Indian Organisation Day was celebrated.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and many well-known people joined the film.
Organ donation can save precious lives.
When the organ goes from one body to another then that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness in this field and in fact, the needy will get the best help because no one can donate this help from any other person.
I said earlier that he is celebrated as Disability Day on December 3.
Physically and mentally handicapped people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes there is pain when they get fun.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and compassion is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change the vision of seeing them then these people can inspire us to live.
You can inspire you to do something.
We start crying even if there is a small problem.
Then I remember that my problem is very small, how does he perform
And therefore, all this is a source of inspiration for us.
His vision of swinging his life with his vision is commendable for transforming the way and crisis into capabilities.
Javed Ahmad, I would like to talk to him today.
40-42 years old.
In 1966, Javed Ahmad was shot dead by the terrorists in Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went on forever, but Javed Ahmad did not lose.
The wounds of terrorism cannot be defeated.
The body does not support but for twenty years they have been immersed in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disabled people in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies into that direction.
He got Master Degree in social work and became an awakened citizen as a social worker, he is making a silent revolution today.
Is the life of Javed not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmad for his penance and dedication on December 3.
In the absence of time, I may be talking about Javed, but in every corner of India, the lamps of such inspiration are enlightening.
The new light of living is spreading, showing the way.
On December 3, it is an opportunity to inspire all such people by remembering them.
Be it a middle class person, a lower middle class person, a poor, a dalit, afflicted, oppressed and deprived, there is a constant need for government arrangements with the government.
And as a citizen, somebody or the other gets a bad feeling from the government Babu.
And that unprecedented experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
Many times we don't even know because it is so simple that we don't know that any government system, some government job is doing this thing.
ASHA workers in our country which are networks across the country.
We have never heard about ASHA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard them.
But when I am the world-renowned family enterpriser of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success has become a philosophy in the world.
When we jointly gave Padma Vibhushan to both such Bill Gates and Millinda Gates.
He works a lot of social work in India.
Whatever they earn for their retirement time and life, they are using them for the work of the poor.
In the past, the Government of Odisha honoured one ASHA worker on Independence Day.
The primary arrangements that they have been taught should be taken for treatment on the basis of them.
Emphasis on every household using pesticide mosquitoes.
As his child sleeps properly and as much care should be taken, Asha Varkar Jamuna Mani Singh is working with full dedication to save the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he fought against malaria and prepared the entire village to fight.
So, how much money will be.
Millions of people will be around us.
We will look at them with respect.
How many such people become capable of our country.
How big is the companion of the happiness of the society.
I sing pride to all such ASHA workers through Jamunamani.
An e-book on the inspirational events of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of Parliamentarians and the health sector.
I urge you to see it.
Not only this, but also show to others.
Read it and make it possible that you have a desire to add such things.
So you must have migov.
In.
Such things do not come in our mind very quickly, but it is true for the society.
Positively capable is the biggest energy.
You also tell the good events - share.
So you can actually become a social teacher.
The temperature of the earth should no longer increase.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also anxiety.
And this is the first way to save temperature.
Energy savings is the National Energy Conservation Day on 14th December.
Several schemes are being run by the government.
Bulb projects are underway.
I had once said that on the night of full moon one should bathe in the light of the moon for hours by shutting down the light of the street light.
It should feel the light of the moon.
If a friend had sent me a link to see and I got the opportunity to see it then I felt that I told you that.
In Kanpur, a woman named Nurjahan does not seem to have got the opportunity to learn more.
But they are doing one such thing that perhaps no one thinks.
They are working to provide light to the poor by using solar energy.
He has set up a committee of women and has set up a plant of solar energy driven FANS.
And they pay a financing of Rs. 100 per month.
People take francs in the evening and come in the morning and give them charging again.
I have heard that people from 5000 houses come in large numbers.
Now see what the big people of the world will do for climate change, but a nurjahan Kada is working to inspire everyone.
And like this, Nurjahan means to publish the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Nurjahan and also congratulate Ji TV because he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
I have received a phone call from Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh.
We seek to know from the senior Prime Minister how adventures and businessmen like us are being supported in the mudra bank that runs
Mudra promotes business enterprises.
Mudra creates opportunities for earnings.
And Mudra empowers in true sense.
The Mudra Yojana is underway to help small adventurers.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning is good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it is a dhobi or a cashew or a printer or a milk seller or a small businessman and I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in 66 lakhs.
And most of the SCs, STs, OBCs are those who work hard and try to run their families with respect.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Somebody has just told me that there is a shailash in Mumbai.
Under Mudra Yojana, he got a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started the trade of Suez dress sanitation.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I said that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle explained.
He has brought a tanker and I am told that in such a short span of time, he has paid two lakh rupees to the bank.
Finally, this is the objective of our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to bring money with more interest.
And earlier due to excessive interests and other reasons, the money that was spent in their hands started saving about one thousand rupees per month.
And a good business of his family began to grow gradually.
But I would like the scheme to be more propagated.
All our banks should become more sensitive and help more and more small people.
Indeed, the economy of the country runs by these people.
Only those who do small work are economically capable of the country.
We also insist on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, I had discussed Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things towards which the society should have a constant awareness in life.
What should be the framework of the program
What is Logo
How to increase public participation
I had said for all these suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are being made.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I expect a lot of square schemes.
And I am told that the participants will have to get certificates.
Any big prize has been announced.
You also run your creative mind.
How can we make this mantra of unity integrity a mantra of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat connecting this mantra to one Indian
Whether it is a living person, it is a glorious person, it is a living person and it is easier to connect everyone, what should the government do
What should the society do
What should civil society do
There may be a lot of things.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely work.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter has come.
I would urge you to use this good weather for some time to keep the body healthy. Yoga will definitely do it for that.
And create an atmosphere in the family, there should be only one festival of the family, one hour each will do the same.
You see how consciousness comes and how much the body supports the whole day.
If there is a good weather then there will be a good habit.
Greetings to my dear countrymen once again.
Jaihind...
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all.
Once again, I am fortunate to be associated with all of you through the words of mind.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to be held in Mumbai.
This category has been named as Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the importance of the final match has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of Akashwani.
I would like that if such Akash Vani Kendras across the country are focused on such aware and active people in their respective areas, then the goal of running the country with public participation will get a new strength.
And that is why I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the colleagues of Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School of Chittor in Kerala have written to me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
Firstly, these children have prepared a picture of Mother India with their thumb marks.
I have sent a picture of India's map.
Earlier, I was very surprised to know why he made India's map with his thumb print.
But when I read his letter, I understand how much a good immunity he has given.
This is not the only children who have tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is campaigning for public awareness for organ donation.
He has also staged the drama in many places so that people can understand the organ donation.
Organ donation becomes a profession and activity.
These children have written to me in the letter that you should urge people to donate organs in your Mann Ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have many messages on phone calls.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
In which people come forward and help each other, the ambitious goal of donating organs by every 10 lakh person is a very fruitful step taken by the government.
I think this thing is very important.
More than two and a half lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in the country of 125 crore, we can only succeed 5,000 transplants.
Every year one lakh eyesight is required.
And we can reach only twenty-five thousand.
We can only give one before the requirement of four eyes.
Efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the writings and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront of organ donation.
Many social institutions and many voluntary institutions are doing well in this direction.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation - Noto has been established to promote organ transplant transplant transplants.
A 24-hour Helpline 18000 1140 services are also available.
And we have been told there that Takteen Bhujitha.
The best description of the joy of sacrifice is in this Tyakteen Bhujitha Mantra.
A few days ago, we all had seen on television that G.
And that operation was successful.
A life has survived.
Let us recognise the feeling of Anga Dan Mahadan Takten Bhujitha and inspire this thing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, recently we celebrated the festivals of Navaratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days I will also celebrate the festival of Diwali.
Id also celebrates Ganesh Chaturthi.
India-Africa Forens Summit is being organised in the capital of India from 26th to 2nd October tomorrow in New Delhi.
For the first time, such a large scale is being organized on the soil of India.
Choppon has been invited to African countries and leaders of the Union.
Outside Africa, one of the largest conferences in Africa is being held.
India and Africa have a strong relationship.
The population of India is the same as the population of African countries.
And if we get both, we are the third largest population in the world.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago this was the same treasure.
Later, these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have such a good approach to natural resources.
And about 2 lakh people of India have been living in this country for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries and has cultural and political relations.
But India plays a very important role in training the youngsters of the most African countries.
HRD, Capacity Building, over 25,000 African students are studying in India.
And today there are many African leaders who have studied in India.
So how deep we have
And this summit is very important in that sense.
Generally, when the summit is held, the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, the heads of the Summit will have to meet.
But it is our endeavour to meet people too.
Nearly 160 schools participated in this.
It also had schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren have written a boost to India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar to Memories of Mahatma, Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar is reaching Delhi on 22nd October.
Millions of school children have seen this exhibition.
The people of the village observed and how Mahatma Gandhi had a great role in the relationship between Africa and India, how Mahatma Gandhi's personality had an impact on both of these territories.
How bright the children of schools in our smaller places are, how broad their vision is, and how deep they think they can see it.
Although this summit is from India-Africa, we can clearly see the opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate all the children participating in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on 15th August, I had made a proposal about the MP Model Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, many Parliamentary Friends have fulfilled this work.
I am very fond of you.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal.
In this, where this ideal village is being built, the Sarpanch, the Collector, some of the Parliamentarians, the Government of India, the State Government, all of them together discussed the topic of Adarshgram Yojana.
Various kinds of innovative things were taken into consideration and encouraging things were found to be known.
I would like to take care of some of these things.
Jharkhand is a very big region and a tribal area in a way.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat in Kunti district of Jharkhand to become an ideal village.
It was difficult for the government employees to go there too.
I congratulate the Honble Parliamentarian, Mr. Karia Munda ji.
And, in the same way, this school provides education for children in the morning and teaching children in the evening.
And these children taught about five hundred and fifty illiterates, read them and read them.
Obviously, there is no budgetary system in the society, no accommodation, no specific system, but how big change can be brought from will power, we can see through the Gram Panchayat.
This village is well known for the production of sugarcane and kurtai round in the state.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Gol Sheep Festival on 11th March in this village.
The people of old public life also came.
An exhibition has also been set up to increase the sale of sugarcane products.
How to make the village a centre of economic activity, how to sell the products of the village, they built sand.
Mr. Ruwala ji is indeed an officer of congratulations for his efforts to build a self-reliant village along with an ideal village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how should it be a matter of mind and how should it not be a matter of cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent me a message through telephone. We clean our houses every year for the preparation of Diwali.
This Deepavali makes our homes as well as the outer environment clean and keeps it clean even after Diwali.
He has taken care of the truth.
I would like to remind you of my valiant countrymen, after the festivals of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, carried a big hustle-bustle and whenever there was a waste of fireworks and said that it was not right.
All the media people had launched a awareness campaign.
And the result was that after Diwali a cleanliness campaign was launched.
So, Savita ji is true that we should do the same concern before the festival even after the festival.
Every public programme should be done.
And today, especially I would like to congratulate the entire media world of India.
I was fortunate to participate in the sanitation summit organized by India to Day Group on the occasion of birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on 2nd October.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I was also seeing how many activities are going on.
For this, people are working themselves like the One Like One Mission.
What are the places in our country which have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and at that time I had concerted my heartfelt gratitude to the commendable work of the India to Day Group.
He has been encouraging cleanliness work for the last one year continuously through e-TV.
He has added more than 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, gardens etc.
Now these newspapers show themselves the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India is the hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of newspapers, I cannot take the name of everyone due to lack of time, but everyone has launched this campaign.
And therefore, according to the suggestions made by Savita Rai ji, today the whole country is accepting this task and pushing it forward.
I have written a letter to our Governor of Meghalaya, Honble Shanmugnath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He wrote that for the last few years, this village has faced the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he was awarded the cleanest village in Asia.
I am happy to hear that there is a village in the remote north-east of Meghalaya in our country which has been engaged in the sanitation sector for years.
This has become a habit of the people there, a culture of the village has become.
This is the only thing that creates confidence in all of us that our country will definitely become clean.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say with pride that the lice we have freed our Mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August, I had said from the Red Fort that there are some things where corruption has been done.
When a poor person goes for a small job, no one knows how hard he has to face and how the beards of the brokers grabb their money.
I have never heard that there is a psychological psychologist in the world who tests a person in a minute two-minute interview.
And I had announced that why don't we abrogate the tradition of interview for small jobs
My young friends, today I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all the procedures and the Central Government will not be able to undertake an interview on the non-gazetted posts of Group D and Group B.
The Rule will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
We will not make any obstacles in the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from 1st January 2016.
So my best wishes to your young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Gold is considered a means of economic security.
Crisis is considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the Gold Bank and the bank will pay you interest on it.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now we will put gold in the bank and the bank will pay you in the form of interest.
Doesn't the countrymen become gold now
Whether gold can change from the dead money into a living power or not
We have to do the same thing, let me support you.
Now do not keep gold at home.
Its safety and interest. Two benefits.
Definitely take advantage.
There is another scheme that sovereign gold bonds do not have gold links in your hands, but there is a paper.
However, the price of this paper is as much as one gold as you return this paper on that day, the same amount of gold will be paid to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
Now we do not need to buy gold.
So, I will surely present this security guarantee scheme to the countrymen next week.
I am happy to say that we are bringing a golden coin with Ashoka Chakra.
It was about 70 years since our independence, but till now we have been using only foreign gold or gold bullion bars.
Why should not our country have indigenous marks
That is why in the next week and the densely densely will come out and Dhanteras will be available to the common citizens, Indian gold coins with five grams and ten grams of Ashoka Chakra are being started.
At the same time, 20 grams of gold bulloon will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring new changes in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My countrymen, Iron Man is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
Recalling Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the map of Unity India comes forward.
This great man has contributed a lot to Indias unity.
He has introduced his capabilities as a man of iron.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb but he had a dream of uniting India, which he had geographically shown, but this mantra of unity should always be a medium of our thoughts, behavior and expression.
India is a country full of diversity.
Our country, full of many sects, many sects, many sects, many castes, many dresses, some diversity and this diversity is due to which we have a glory.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we might have been proud of the beauty that we could not have taken.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the last few years, Run for Unity programmes are being organized across the country on 31st October.
I have heard that this time also it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for a race of unity.
The race of unity is really a race of development.
In other words, the guarantee of development is also a race of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Please move ahead with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be visiting Britain.
I am very excited for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also provide scholarships to such sections of the society, whether it is Dalit or tribal or backward, to the brilliant children who are going to learn abroad.
I believe that when our children of India are going to study in Britain, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them.
And that is why I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
And now you can imagine how much enjoyable people like me will be able to imagine the wealth of the 125 crore countrymen who are connected with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
I will also have another opportunity to meet in London and unveil the statue of Lord Bashweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Bashweshwar for democracy and women empowerment is indeed a studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Bashweshwar on the house of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought, how long they thought, how long they thought.
You know that when such incidents are connected, we all get thrilled by the minds of the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Your letters are later discussed on Akashwani.
Government officials are called and discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
And there is a good relationship between us.
I was finishing a year in the past.
Today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen.
Jai Hind.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
There is a basic idea in my life and because of this, I have immense faith in the power of the people but I can say that the people's power is even more unconventional than what they have taught me, what they have taught me, what they have understood and what they have experienced.
Our ancestors used to say that mass dedication is a part of God.
I can say from my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that there is a great strength in our ancestors' ideas, there is a great truth because I have realized that I used to ask for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and could talk only on two or four suggestions every time but lakhs of people used to be active and inform me that this is a great power.
Yes, these lakhs of letters gave me a big lesson.
Different departments of the government analyzed the letters of the people and what is the matter of policy, what is the matter of personal question, what is it not in the mind of the government.
Who thought that the source of these information would become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that the selfie with the doctor and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, somebody has got the dignity of selfie with the doctrine of millions and daughters.
And when he used to do 'Selfie with Doctor', he used to enhance the enthusiasm of his daughter but also created commitment within himself.
Whenever people used to see, they felt that the neglect of daughters would have to be neglected now.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I had told the same citizens that you also go to Incredible India, if you have a good picture, I will see it.
However, there has been a huge change in the number of lakhs of people who have sent such pictures from every corner of India, perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India, the tourism department of the state government has never thought that we have such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Doesn't the demand of time or Khadi for fashion
Today, with great satisfaction, I have said that the sale of khadi has almost doubled in the last one year. Now this work has not been done due to public reports.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher was standing in a widow lady line to leave the subsidy.
The common man of the society, the middle class and the lower middle class, for whom subsidy is difficult, but such people have left.
Is not this silent revolution
Is not this a view of Jan Shakti
Governments also have to learn wisdom that the work that happens in our government offices is a powerful, powerful and determined society of a large manpower outside the umbrella.
We made every small thing ourselves and tried to connect ourselves for the welfare of the country.
What can be a big satisfaction with this
In Mann Ki Baat this time I thought of using a new experiment.
I prayed to the citizens of the country to telephone your questions and suggestions.
I will focus on Mann Ki Baat.
This is a very pleasant experience.
The people of all ages have conveyed their message.
I liked to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is working on the rest.
You may have taken a minute or two minutes but your phone call is very important for me.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising and joyful for me.
However, it seems as if there is negativeness and negativeness all around.
But my experience was different.
This Panchavan thousands of people had to speak their own words.
But I am surprised that all things were in the shadow of Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, informal, creative.
People have said more than 0 of the rest of the energy filling and enjoying things.
They must have heard the radio.
I was noticed from this point of view how important the radio would be for the blind people.
I see a new dimension and have said such good things that these people and the government are sufficient to make it sensitive.
I have given me a message from Alwar Rajasthan to Pawan Acharya.
Listen what they want to say - surely listen - my name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like the wind, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India.
We have suggested that the soil does not have the root and so the soil lamps are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the army personnel.
Whether it is our navy, our naval forces, the ground forces, the air force, the army, the air force, the Navy.
The war of 1965 was completed with Pakistan for 50 years.
He has set up a gallantry exhibition near India Gate in Delhi.
If you see from the point of view of history, you can learn a lot and look for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no greater inspiration to serve the motherland.
Whether the fight is of Hajipeer, the real north of Chaminda and Hajipeer sees the scenes of victory, it is thrilled and it is proud of our army personnel.
My meeting with these brave families was also to meet the families of the martyrs and those who participated in the war are now in the north of life.
If you want to make history then it is important to understand history in depth.
I have returned in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three or four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has directed the elderly Prime Minister, but he has forgotten to call his name in the earliest.
We should also make the habit of cleanliness and also make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction from the message of this child.
I also have to hear a lot.
I see the best thing that the Parliament of the country is also discussing for the cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, the child of this country speaks on cleanliness - what could be the privilege of the country bigger than this
The movement that is going on - the atmosphere of hatred towards dirt - awareness about cleanliness - it will also compulsory the governments to work and provide it.
Even if there are shortcomings, we have to move forward. And in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Once he said: If I want to choose one of the two Swachhata and Swachhata, I will first choose cleanliness, after independence, cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhi.
From Delhi, Gulshan Arora ji has sent a message on My Gaw.
He wrote that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men is always a cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our task to evaluate the idea of the great man.
You take any date, some of the windows of history will get the name of a great man.
In the days to come, let us remember all these great men, let us send the message of their life to the household and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I would like to appeal once again for 2nd October.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, every kind of fabric, many things, but you should have a place for khadi.
I have once again said that from October 2 to a month, Khadi is free.
We should take advantage of this.
And the handloom should be given the same importance along with khadi.
The poor manufacturers will go to the house of a widow and therefore, in this Diwali, we must give Khadi a place in our house and place it on our body.
And when you see, the sales have almost doubled.
How many poor have benefitted.
You people have done the work that the government cannot do with the publicity of billions of rupees with small help.
This is the Jan Shakti and therefore I once again urge you for this work.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy with one thing.
You should also get a little taste of this joy.
I had gone to Kolkata in the month of May and I had come to meet the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose organised everything.
I had the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhash Babu for a long time.
You can imagine how much happiness will be for me .
Perhaps for the first time in his life, the family members of Netaji would have come to the forefront of visiting the Prime Minister's residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of great happiness for me that I have never been fortunate to have such a hospitality at Bada Pradhan Niwas, which is going to meet me in October.
More than 50 people of Subhash Babu and the entire family live in different countries and all people are coming specially.
I got a message from Bhargavi Kannada and after listening to all this, I felt like that he himself feels a leader and perhaps he would become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make such a statement to the elder Prime Minister that you should awaken the younger generation about water registration so that the participation of the younger generation in the coming days and the important cooperation of the younger generation in the future is being chosen and run by the government.
Every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing gradually.
A few years ago, we saw that our Election Commission has been working as the only controller but in the last few years there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission has not only been a controller but has become a facilitator in a way- Voter friend and all its ideologies are in the polling station.
The voter list should continue to be upgraded and we should also be checked.
I would like to say in the time of election that after the first voting, drinking water.
How sacred it is, everyone should do it.
On the ultimate day, I visited Kashi.
One I got a student of seventh grade named Kshitij Pandey.
He is ranked seventh in Kendriya Vidyalaya at Banaras Hindu University.
Well, it is very sharp.
But I saw his interest in physics research at such a young age.
How sensitivity comes in robots, what was it saying, it was very strange that brother.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child . Why
How
When
This child should ask the mind.
Similarly, I had to meet a very small child Sonam Patel.
It's nine years old.
The daughter of Sadabrij Patel, a resident of Sunderpur in Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family and I was surprised that the whole song of that child is foolish.
But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked him, he used to say slok, used to interpret it in English, used to define it, used to define it in Hindi.
Only the Gita reads or the other is read .
If history takes place then in the evening it has everything to face.
We all are surprised to know how they are so talented in the entire family
I was really very impressed.
Sometimes some children like celebrity, but Sonam does not have anything like this.
Besides the television you have seen, read in newspapers, we do a lot of work and sometimes enjoy these things.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that some people come with a lot of work for me in Mann Ki Baat.
Sandeep ji, what will you do to me
I have to do so much rubbish once in a month, I have to adjust so much time.
Sometimes, my friends of Akashwani have to wait for half-fifteen hours.
But I respect your feelings.
I thank you for your suggestion.
Now it's just a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much did Subhash Babu use radio
He started his radio from Germany and was constantly aware of Indias freedom movement through radio.
He started the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly News Bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu all languages.
It is now a year for me to talk about Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani.
I am also talking to you and this is my satisfaction.
I will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending notices.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
Reforms start.
Your contribution is valuable for me.
Once again my best wishes to all of you.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
Once again I got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
People in remote regions are celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Considering social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, everyone has accepted these schemes.
I had made a small plea that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, we should offer this security scheme to our sisters.
I have been informed that 11 crore families have been connected to this scheme from the beginning of this scheme till date.
Moreover, I have also been told that almost half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider this auspicious sign.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
The work that has not been done for sixty years will be done in such a short span of time why
I also saw the immortality of the poor
Accounts were to be opened from zero balance.
But the poor saved the amount of twenty-five thousand crore.
Young people have got employment.
You will be happy to know that in this year, one lakh 13 thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Only the accounts should not be opened and stopped.
And now thousands of people have also become officers to get overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And this belief was also created that the poor could get money from the bank.
I have brought him to you and now it is your job to maintain it.
The accounts of all of us should be active.
I am sure you will do that.
In the last days, the incidents of Gujarat have made the entire country restless.
But in a very short span of time all my enlightened citizens of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
The situation got worse and first played an active role and once again Gujarat moved on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brothers, this is the true path.
And we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is a solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to listen to them.
And I really realized that I got the opportunity to listen to their words in a way as if some music was singing.
I liked it very well.
Perhaps it has become most important to realize the true form of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the love that the Sufi tradition is associated with generosity will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also tell others that even if we believe in any sect, we should sometimes understand the Sufi tradition.
I am fortunate to have another opportunity in the coming days and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
In India, scholars from Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya.
Indias first Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
I will have the opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you especially today.
Earlier, I have mentioned this in Mann Ki Baat.
I would have heard of it in the Parliament, I would have heard it in the public meetings, I would have heard it in the Mann Ki Baat.
I have always been saying that the government's mind is open on the issue of the Land Exhibition Act which is being discussed.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the farmers and I have been saying that again and again.
But today I have to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the reforms in the Land Exhibition Act have come through the states, it has come to the urge that if we want to make the villages and the poor farmers a canal to provide water to the fields, to provide electricity to the villages, to make roads for the poor, to provide employment to the poor youth of the village, then we have to leave the ears out of the square of this implementing democracy.
And then there was a proposal for reform.
But I saw that so much fear was spread and the farmer was so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, my farmer should not be confused and should never be afraid.
And I don't want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers and confuses the farmers.
We presented an ordinance.
Tomorrow, the Ordinance term is being completed on August 13.
And I have decided to end it.
This means that the situation that was earlier formed by my government has now been re-established.
But one of them was incomplete.
And that's why we brought him to the Ordinance but due to these disputes, the matters were also lost.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us, it is our mantra.
The welfare of the village, the poor farmers.
And that is why I had said on 15th August that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Farmers Welfare will be set up.
And when the war of 1965 comes, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is also very natural to remember the tricolor flag of India and all those martyrs who maintained their peace.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
And I am glad that India is working in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these researches to the common man .
How to transform the principles into equipment
How to connect the lab with the land
It has to be pushed forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also a very inspiring for me.
And when I said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity, there are many possibilities.
I get several letters from the citizens.
We have written about Skill Development.
Shri Prakash Tripathy from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
The emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I have also spoken to my young friends.
On 15th August I had said from the top of the Red Fort why the interview for lower level jobs
And when the interviews don't come, then where will every poor family, widows and mother get the emotions
The poor do not have to run for emotion.
Exploitation doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for mother mortality and infant mortality, the call-to-action has been contemplated by twenty-four countries of the world.
This was the first time in any other country outside the US.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India's appreciation has also started at the international level, yet these figures are not small
Just as we have got rid of polio, we have also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue continues to come.
It is true that dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save it.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is connected directly to it.
We need advertisation on TV.
There is a widespread public education in this regard but we do not pay attention to it.
I would urge all of you not to make death so cheap.
Life is very precious.
Being aware of water, sadness about cleanliness - it becomes a cause of death, it is not right.
Dengue free check-up facilities are available at about five hundred fourteen centres across the country.
Cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in a way in our country from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why should not every festival be connected with cleanliness now
You see, culture will become a habit
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the spirit of serving the tribals of India is strong.
Both of these brothers have enhanced Indias pride.
This year both of these brothers won the race.
Indias honour has increased.
I extend my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am extremely happy to note that his entire mission, Team India Vision for Tribal, is being done with the intention of releasing it for the tribals.
Look, how everybody is trying to push the country forward
When we hear such incidents then chest blossoms.
Sometimes due to perception, we sit injustice to our youngsters.
My experience in relation to the youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the young people and we also learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say, Brothers and sisters, I have taken a vow in my life that Sande on Cycle.
Some people say that I have kept cycling day one day of the week.
Today, I would like to especially congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now it will become a magnificent, divine and inspiring memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar will now become an inspirational place for the Maharashtra government when the Indians traveling around the world will go to London.
I convey my sadhuvad to the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
After a long distance, once again, we are starting the Mann Ki Baat, the talk of the people, the talk of the people, the talk of the people and the talk of the people.
Several people used to hear, repeat and sometimes our own words used to become inspiration for us in a light environment, as a selfish family of 130 crore Indians.
You can imagine how the time has gone and how it has gone.
Perhaps this was not a lifeless programme.
I was doing something at every moment and when I speak Mann Ki Baat, I am speaking, words may be mine, voice is mine but the story is yours, the male is yours, the valour is yours.
I used only my words, my words and because of that I was missing this programme.
I was feeling empty.
But this Sunday will wait a lot.
Well, ultimately there is a chance.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small, light, in society, in life, which becomes a cause of change.
In a way, this order gives birth to a new spirit and in a way supports the spirit of a New India.
I feel myself.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to Samti.
This is my journey from Aham to Wayam.
For me, my silence dialogue with you was also a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions why I went to Kedarnath in the race for elections.
Most of the people have taken out political meaning from it.
It was an opportunity for me to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity, I think I will also discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have been constantly feeling in your efforts to strengthen a positive thing.
The letters received for Mann Ki Baat are very different from regular government functioning.
Sometimes the work of pushing my thought process forward makes some of your words.
If someone writes for hygiene then he is also showing his disagreement towards dirt but he also explains the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone discusses the environment then he feels the pain, but he also explains the experiments he has seen and depicts the imaginations he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I feel the glimpse of how to solve the problems across the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and society.
It shows us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate strength and talent, provide opportunity and activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells that all 130 crore Indians want to connect with the strength and activeness of the country's development. And I would definitely say that in Mann Ki Baat I have so many letters, so many telephone calls, so many messages are available, but the elements of the complaint are very low and if someone wants something for himself, then one thing has not been noticed in the last five years.
When I analyze such things - you can imagine how much joy will be for my heart, how much energy will I get.
I have not come to Acutally, you have brought me, you have disappointed me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
Let us move ahead with this spirit, let us move ahead with the order of Mann Ki Baat.
When the crisis was imposed in the country, its opposition was not confined to the political sector, it was not confined to the politicians, the movement was not confined to the jail.
There was an anger in the hearts of the people.
The lost democracy was thirsty.
Whenever we eat on time and night, we do not know what hunger happens, the same way what the joy of the rights of democracy in normal life is known only when a democratic authority is overwhelmed.
Every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched.
Perhaps every person in any country of the world has voted for democracy, not only for the rest of his rights, rights, requirements, but also for democracy.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a huge election campaign, accomplished in our country, from Amir to the poor, everybody was willing to decide the future of our country.
Whenever any thing is very close to us, we underestimate its importance, its amazing effects are also ignored.
This number may seem to be very common to us but if I say that if we leave China then more than any country in India had voted.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than two times the total population of the United States.
The number of total electors in India is more than the entire population of Europe.
It introduces the vastness and widespreadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the largest democratic election in the world in the history so far.
You can imagine the need for resources and human power at a large level to complete such elections.
Elections could be made possible by day and night hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
While about 3 lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces performed their responsibilities to successfully finish this great yagya of democracy, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked hard.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more voting took place than the past.
You can imagine about 10 lakh Polling Stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines for voting.
All this has been done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his electorate.
Polling stations have been set up for only one female electorate in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the Election Commission officials had to travel for two-two days to reach there. This is the true respect for democracy.
Polling stations located at the highest level in the world are also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also another fact full of pride in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
In this election, the percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal.
One more encouraging fact associated with this is that today there is a record 8 female parliamentarian in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and salute the aware voters of India.
My beloved countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth that books are not booked, I had requested whether we can give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Somebody recently gave me a book named Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniya, and I liked it a lot.
Though I could not get a lot of time, I got the opportunity to re-read some of his stories during the tour.
His speeches that express human emotions in simple language touched my mind too.
His interactions encompass the spirit of the entire India.
When I was reading the story of his written drunkenness, my mind went on the economic inequalities in the society.
I was reminded of the days of my youth how discussions were held overnight on this subject.
The heroes of the landlord's son Ishwari and the heroes of the poor family learn that if you are not cautious then the impact of the bad colony is never known.
The second conversation that touched my heart was Idgah.
The sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When Hamid of 4-5 years reaches his grandmother with chipies from the fair, the human sensitivity really reaches its peak.
In this interaction, a live picture of the problems faced by the poor farmers was seen.
Despite the loss of their crops, the slight farmers are happy that they do not have to sleep in the fields in the extreme cold.
Though this talk is about a century ago, its relevance is the same even today.
After reading it, I felt a different kind of feeling.
When I was talking about reading, in some media, I used to read about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled between the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of Primary School, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked hard for this library.
There was a time when books were tied in a pot and laden on the back.
Today this library, along with tribal children, is showing a new path to everyone.
The Vanche Gujarat campaign in Gujarat has been a successful experiment.
Lakhs of people of every age had participated in this campaign to read books.
During the time of Google Guru in today's digital world, I would also urge you to take some time and place books in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and surely write about the books that you read on the Narendra Modi App so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issues that are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf, many people have written to me about the challenges related to water.
Water is of great importance in our culture.
In Rig Veda's 'Aap: Suktam', water is a source of energy and energy.
Your blessings are like your mother and your grace continues to rain on us.
Several parts of the country are affected every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water received from rains throughout the year is saved in our country.
Only 8.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that just like many other problems, we will solve this crisis with public participation, with public power, with the capability, collaboration and determination of one hundred and thirty crore people.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been created in the country.
This will make quick decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to separate something.
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanches across the country, to the Gram Pradhan.
I wrote to the Gram Pradhans that to save water, to save water, to save rain drops of water, they should discuss with the villagers by calling a meeting of the Gram Sabha.
I am happy that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month, crores of people in thousands of Panchayats donated labour.
People in the villages resolved to collect one drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to listen to you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are ready to play their active role for water conservation once again.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister, to every Sarpanch for their activeness on behalf of me.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have accelerated the demand for water conservation.
In a way, it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village are now engaged in the competition to build water temples in their villages.
As I said, many positive results of collective efforts can be achieved.
There cannot be a single formula to come out of the water crisis throughout the country.
Efforts are being made in different parts of the country for this.
But everyone's goal is the same, and it is to save water, water conservation.
Drainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging.
With the construction of a tank in Thimaipalli, Telangana, the lives of the people of the village are changing.
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
I was studying a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that several such efforts are being made and when we try together and firmly then we can make the impossible possible.
When people join, water will be saved.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat, I am urging the countrymen to make three requests.
My first request is, just as the people of the country have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us resolve to save every drop of water in collaboration with Sahu and I am confident that water is the prasad of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier it was said that iron becomes gold with the touch of Paras.
I say that water is cross and a new life is created by the touch of Paras and water.
Initiate a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I especially urge the dignitaries of different sectors to lead innovative camps for water conservation.
Whether it is the world of films, the field of sports, our friends of the media, the people associated with social organisations, the people associated with cultural organisations, the narrators, every person should lead this movement in his own way.
Make the society awakened, connect society with society.
You see, we will see a change in front of your eyes.
My second urge is that many traditional methods have been used for water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you has got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, Puja Bapu's birth place, then there is another house behind the revered Bapu's house, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is water in it and there is a system to stop rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir visits, you must see this water tank.
There will be many such uses at every place.
Let us inspire people for water conservation by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You all can share your content using JanShakti4JalShaktiHeshTag.
My dear countrymen, I also have to express my gratitude to you for one thing and also thank the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again, three-three, four-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day with enthusiasm.
The greatness of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has emerged for holistic healthcare.
If a Yoga lover welcomes it as soon as the sun rises in every corner of the world, then it is a whole journey till the sun sets.
Perhaps there will be a place where human beings are not connected to yoga, such a big Yoga has taken the form.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from AC Gyms to Desert Desert, from villages to cities wherever possible, Yoga was not only done, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, distinguished dignitaries and ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on a tweet how they celebrated Yoga in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards for the promotion and development of Yoga in 2017 was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to those organizations around the world which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the propaganda of Yoga.
For example, take 'Japan Yoga Niketan' which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Many of Japan Yoga Niketan runs Institutes and Training courses or Ms.
Antonietta Rozi, who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
It is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a subject related to yoga, can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and has been dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honored and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
The comprehensive celebrations of Yoga and the honour of those who delivered the message of Yoga at home, both made this Yoga Day special.
It is a big journey for me to connect with your ideas. Mann Ki Baat is forever.
Let us meet, let us talk.
Keep listening to your feelings, be honest and understanding.
Sometimes I try to live with that feeling.
Keep on getting your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us enjoy Mann Ki Baat along with us. Let us also follow the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India has lost her brave sons.
We sacrificed these brave heroes for the protection of hundred and fifty crore Indians.
Our brave sons had made it one day and night for the countrymen to sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in Pulwama terror attack, the hearts of the people and the people of the whole country are shocked and wrathed.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families are all around.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who laid down their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting racism, communalism, territorialism and all other differences, so that our actions against terrorism are stronger than ever before.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unparalleled courage and valour.
He has unanimously demonstrated his magnificent potential for peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also been given an answer in their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The army has pledged to destroy the solidarity of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the motivation and inspiration of the members of their family through the media has given courage and strength to the entire country.
Ramniranji, father of the martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, also inspires all of us in this hour of grief.
He said that he will send his other son to fight against the enemy and if necessary, he will also fight himself.
The whole country salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of the martyrs of Jagat Singhpur in Odisha.
They have also pledged to recruit one of their sons in the CRPF.
When the martyr Vijay Soren's Parthiv Deh reached Gumla in Jharkhand wrapped in the tricolor, his Masum Dari had said that I will also join the army.
The spirit of this mosquito expresses the feelings of one child all over India.
Similar feelings are being seen in the house of our brave martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to try to know and understand the spirit they have shown by these families.
What happens to sacrifice, penance and we do not need to go to the ancient event of history.
On the Narendra Modi app, Shri Omkar Shetty ji of Karnataka has expressed his happiness over the formation of the National War Memorial (National War Memorial).
I was also surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India.
This is a memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow i.e. on 25th February, we will dedicate this national military memorial to our army.
The country will make such a small effort to repay its credit.
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are located, just near it a new memorial has been built.
I am confident that it will be appropriate to visit this national military memorial for the countrymen to go to a pilgrimage.
This National Soldier Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation towards the supreme sacrifices made after independence.
The design of the memorial showcases the indomitable courage of our soldiers.
Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrs.
The second circle is of Veerta Chakra which expresses the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
Thereafter there is a cycle of sacrifice.
The Circle showcases the sacrifices of the soldiers.
The names of the soldiers who sacrificed the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
After that the defence cycle showcases safety.
This circular has a row of dense trees.
On one hand, the identification of the National Military Memorial will emerge as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country with the aim of studying their gratitude.
Those who sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in words in the development of the country.
In October last year, I had the privilege of dedicating the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea that under which we believe that the people who are constantly busy in our security should be gratitude towards the men and women's police personnel.
I hope you will definitely visit your National Military Memorial and National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat continue to read me through different means.
This time when I was studying your comments, I noticed a very interesting drop of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He wrote that when the British captured Birsa Munda on March 3, 100, he was only 25 years old.
Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshed ji Tata on 3rd March.
He further writes that these two personalities are completely different from the family background, which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, to pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is equal to bow down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have illuminated the name of the entire country not only of Jharkhand but also of Jharkhand.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youngsters need some inspirational personality for guidance then that is Lord Birsa Munda.
Whenever he slept, the British hid and caught him with a lot of cleverness.
Do you know why the British took the support of such careful action
Because the British who raised such a big empire were also scared of them.
Lord Birsa Munda embarrassed the British rule decorated with guns and cannons only by his traditional pilgrimage.
In fact, when people get an inspirational leadership, the collective will power of the people is overwhelming.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight against the British only for political independence.
But they fought for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the dark life of the underprivileged and exploited, he shines like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the young age of 25 years.
The sons of Bharat Mata like Birsa Munda have been in all parts of the country.
There will be no corners of India where no one has contributed to this freedom struggle that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately, the words of their sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda makes us aware of his existence, then the dignitaries like Jamshed ji Tata gave a big institution to the country.
Jamshedji Tata was really a visionary, who not only saw the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a center of science technology and industry for the future.
As a result, Tata Institute of Science was established which is now known as the Indian Institute of Science (Indian Institute of Science).
Not only this, he also established world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on February 22.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the owner of simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Vikram Morarjibhai Desai is the largest budget in Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India at a difficult time when there was a threat to the democratic tension of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai shouted in a movement against rigidity for the protection of democracy.
That is why he had to pay a huge price even in old age.
The government of that time arrested him and put him in jail.
But when the Janta Party won the elections in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The amendment also provides that the fundamental rights obtained under sections 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be abolished during the jurisdiction.
For the first time it was arranged that the President would announce the Constitution only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet and it was also decided that the term of the dispute cannot be extended to more than six months at a time.
Thus, Morarjibhai ensured that the way Criminal Laddi was killed in the 15th century, democracy could not be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution to maintaining the honour of Indian democracy.
Once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year also people were very excited about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving on the path of a new India, in which we want to honour those people who are doing their work in a neutral manner at the foundation stone level.
With their hard work, those who are bringing about positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In fact, he is a true Karmayogi, who remains selfless in the service of the people, social service and in front of all this.
I would like to tell you about some such people.
Talking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked amazingly to revive the traditional rogan art of Kutch.
They are doing a great job to bring this rare art to a new generation.
I presented to former US President Barack Obama the artwork of Trie of Life (Life Tree) built by Abdul Gafur.
In the Padma Award, Shabbid Syed of Marathawad is known as the servant of Gautama.
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of Mother Gau is unparalleled.
You will be happy to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America. Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he is imparting yoga training to the people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers so far.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Torzen in Jharkhand, took the courageous task of combating the mafia and naxalists of Timber and saved not only 50 hectares of forests but inspired ten thousand women to conserve trees and wildlife.
Despite being disabled himself, it is difficult to find an example of the work he has done for the upliftment of Divyang women, and by establishing an institution called Pragyachakshu Women Sevakunj, they are working renewedly to make blind children self-reliant.
He presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women in their area to join the Self Help Group to make them economically a step ahead.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to talk about the experience of touching the heart of all those who have been feeling for the past few days.
Today, wherever I go to the country, I have been trying to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme PMJAY i. e.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have seen how big changes are taking place in the lives of the poor.
If you all know any such poor person who cannot get treatment without money, then definitely tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every such poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for examination is going to start in schools.
Different education boards across the country will launch action for 10th and 12th standard board examination in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to all the students of the exams, to their volunteers and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event was held in the form of a town hall in Delhi.
The feature of the Pariksha Pe Discussion Programme was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination.
There were some aspects that would certainly be beneficial for the students.
If all the students can see this entire programme on their parents and teachers on YouTube then my best wishes to the warriors of all my exams for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, be a matter of India and not a matter of festival
There will be no such day in our country which does not have any importance, which does not have any festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri will come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, a special significance of it is enriched in our mind temple.
My best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
So, he said, I am doing a mimecry of the Prime Minister.
I really got very impressed with the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, it is a unique experience for me to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through radio, I meet crores of families every month in a way.
Sometimes, while talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on the phone, I feel like giving me a part of my family.
This is a very pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections are a big festival of democracy.
We will be busy running for the next two months.
And I will continue to speak with you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, on the 21st of this month, the country got a very sad news.
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the society.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us: "It is equal to being in the Kailasam Dham, the residence of Lord Shiva while working hard.
His fame was as a scholar whose English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages were wonderful.
He was a social reformer.
He put his entire life behind the goal that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The welfare of the farmers in every way was the priority of Swamiji's life.
Siddhaganga Monastery organized animals and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have been fortunate to get the blessings of the supreme reverenced Swamiji several times.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for revered Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhaganga Monastery beautifully.
Once again, I offer my respects to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is also older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
In our country, there is no bit in ensuring that every citizen of India who is a registered voter, registered voter will get an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that in Himachal Pradesh, a polling station is set up at a height of 15,000 feet from sea level, in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, voting arrangements are also made in interior islands.
Just for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping in mind a voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his voter, the entire team of ECI staff goes to the interior and arranges for voting and this is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for its continuous efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the voting process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
There is an opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become part of the decision-making process in the country.
It is time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to note that if they are eligible to vote, they must register themselves as voters.
Everyone of us should realise that becoming a voter in the country, getting the right to vote, is an important step in the achievement of life.
It is my duty to vote at the same time that this feeling should continue within us.
There should be a lot of pain in life if you cannot vote for any reason.
Whenever there is something wrong in the country, it should be sad.
I urge eminent dignitaries of the country to make people aware of the fact that all of us should be registered or voted on the day of polls.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary with a different style.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
You know that since independence in the Red Fort many rooms and buildings were closed till now.
It has been converted into a very beautiful museum, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army, a museum dedicated to Yaad-e-Jaliyan and a museum dedicated to the first freedom struggle of 185 India and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
These museums have a fragrance of our glorious history in one brick.
At the corner of the museum, the story of the heroes of our freedom struggle inspires us to enter into history.
At this place, the brave sons of Mother India - Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurubakhsh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were run by the British rule.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Kranti Temple in the Red Fort, the members of Netaji's family gave me a very special hat.
Netaji used to wear this hat.
I preserved the hat in the museum so that people visiting there also look at the hat and take inspiration from it to patriotism.
In fact, the valour and patriotism of his heroes is required to be consistently conveyed to new generations.
Just a month ago, on 30th December, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose hoisted the tricolor five years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there is a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to complete 5 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organiser.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with zealous slogans like 'Dilli Chalo', 'Tum Muje Khun Deo', 'My Tumhen Freedom Dunga'.
For many years, it was demanding that files associated with Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we have been able to do that.
I remember that day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we spoke a lot related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Be it 26 Alipur rods associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar or be it Sardar Patel museum or be it Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium to connect with the people, as Netaji had a close relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the people of the country.
In 1942, Subhas Babu launched the Azad Hind Radio and through radio, he used to interact with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country.
I was told that he used to spread radio stations, weekly news bulletins which used to live in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pasto and Urdu etc.
In the operation of this radio station, residents of Gujarat, M.
Vyas ji played a very important role.
The programmes being broadcast on the Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle.
A visual museum has also been built in this Kranti Temple.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 artworks of three centuries old have been installed.
The museum depicts excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avinendra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Selloz Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you would be wondering that the matter is happening here and I am talking about the excellent work of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many subjects.
He has also made pictures of animal birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and then he has worked to bring human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to many of his works.
He believed that those who see their pictures themselves understand the pictures, see the message given by them in the pictures from their point of view.
His pictures have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope you will definitely visit the Kranti temple to see their pictures.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
One such saint was Saint Ravidas.
Ravidas Jayanti is celebrated on 1st February.
The Doha of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Sant Ravidas ji used to give a big message through a few lines.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every person, it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his message.
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained to the world the real meaning of labour's reputation.
He used to say, "Man Changa, Kathati I Ganga, if your mind and heart are sacred then Sakshat God lives in your heart.
The messages of Saint Ravidas ji have influenced the people of every class, whether it is the Maharaja of Chittor or the queen of Chittor or Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
Once again I salute Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidhar has written on MyGov that I will highlight the aspects related to Indias space programme and its future.
He also wanted me to urge students to take interest in the space programme and think of moving ahead from the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and the message given specially for our children.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to numerous young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that today the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching the space.
This was launched on 24th January by our students, Kalam-Set.
Sounding rockets made by the students of the University in Odisha have also made many records.
The more space missions have been launched since independence in 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also made a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously with the same spacecraft.
Soon we are going to reflect Indias presence on the moon through Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way to protect the lives.
Whether it is gas or rail and road safety, all these are being helped by space technology.
Navic devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their security as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and responsibilities of government services.
About 40 lakh households from 23 States have been geo-tagged under the scheme 'Badha Ki Badha'.
At the same time, about three and a half crore assets under Manrega have also been gio-tagged.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
It has contributed immensely to our best relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites have been a unique initiative that has also gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through our extremely competitive launch services, India today launches not only the satellites of developing countries but also of developed countries.
Skies and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programme gives children an opportunity to think big and move ahead of the boundaries which were considered impossible till now.
It is a vision to keep watching stars for our children and to inspire innovative stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that the game will play and this time many young and young sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When sportspersons perform better at the local level, they will also perform better at the global level.
This time, in Khelo India, sportspersons from every state have performed well at their own level.
The life of many sportspersons who have won medals is inspiring.
In Mukkabaji, young player Akash Gorakha won the silver medal and I was reading that the father of the sky Ramesh ji works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
So, under 21 women Kabddi team of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and mother encouraged Sonali's Hunar.
Many times it is seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like kabaddi.
However, Sonali chose and performed excellent performance.
Asansol's ten-year-old Innovation Shaw, wins the youngest gold medal at Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani won a gold medal in weightlifting in Karnataka.
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolution of youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India show that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India, but the people coming from small towns and villages are also contributing to youngsters and young sports talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the competition to brighten the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is Clean beautiful toilet.
With the help of keeping their toilets clean, people are making some pictures by making them colorful and making them beautiful, you will also get to see many photographs of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Kamrup to Kamrup on social media.
I invite all Sarpanches and Gram Pradhans to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely share the picture of your clean beautiful toilets with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and open defecation free.
Today, with the help of the people of India, India is moving towards becoming Open Defecation Free shortly before 2nd October, 2019 so that Bapu can pay homage to him on his 150th birth anniversary.
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat have also contributed immensely to this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat. And therefore, with your colleagues, I am happy to note that more than 5 lakh 50 thousand villages and 6000 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and Swachhta Coverage has crossed 8 in rural India and about 9 crore families have been provided toilet facilities.
My young friends, the days of the examination will come.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about exams and exams.
Ansul ji, thank you for raising these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the exam period.
Students, from their parents to teachers, many people are busy in exams related work.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this subject today in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, but you would be happy to know that I would like to interact with the students from all over the country in the Pariksha Pe Discussion programme on 2nd January at 11 a.m.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in this programme.
In this Pariksha Pe Discussion, I will talk to my young friends on all aspects related to examinations, especially on stress-free examinations.
I had urged people to send inputs and ideas for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are putting their ideas on MyGov.
I will certainly keep some of these ideas and suggestions before you during the Town Hall Programme.
You must become part of this program...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, this is the death anniversary of revered Bapu on January 30.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
Let us also pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes wherever we are.
Remember the pious Bapu and realize the dreams of revered Bapu, build a New India, fulfilling our duties as a citizen, let us move forward with this resolution.
May this journey of 2019 be successfully extended.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can transform our lives and contribute to the development of our fellow country and society.
My best wishes to all of you on the year 2019.
You must have thought how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember as a nation in 2019 as the capability of one hundred and thirty crore people.
It gives us all the pride.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
Distinguished institutions in the world have believed that India is liberating the country from poverty on the lines of a revolutionary pace.
With the determination of the people of the country, cleanliness coverage has increased to 5.
For the first time from the Red Fort after independence, the tricolor was hoisted on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who celebrated the country in the form of unity, the world's tallest statue was found in the Statue of Unity.
The country's name has risen in the world.
The nation was felicitated with the UNs highest environmental award champions of the India Award.
Indias efforts in solar energy and climate change have been ranked worldwide.
The country's self-defence has got a new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have become nuclear power in water, place and navel three.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by roaming around the world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the waterways sector.
The country's longest rail-road bridge, Bogibile Bridge, was dedicated to the nation, and the first and 100 Maa Airport of Sikkim-Pakyong was inaugurated.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in Para Asian Games.
However, if I keep talking about the male and our collective efforts of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will go so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this is possible by the unwavering efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that even in 2017, this journey of Indias progress and progress will continue and our country will be able to scale new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for providing affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always ready for the treatment of the patient.
He used to pay the rent to the elderly patients who came to him for treatment.
I'm thebeterindia.
I have read about his work that inspires the society on com website.
Similarly, on 25th December, the demise of Sulagitti Narasamma in Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narasamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded Padmashree.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who dedicated their lives to the well-being of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the last few days, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are using camps and treating the poor free of cost.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The zeal of these doctor friends who are engaged in service with a selfless sense of self-reliance is indeed commendable.
Today, I am proud to say that due to collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the cleanliness mission in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I got to read about Jayachandran and when I got the opportunity, thebeterindia.
I have been trying to know these inspirational things by going to com.
I am happy that nowadays there are several websites that are introducing us with many stories that inspire the lives of such people.
Like thepositive India.
com is working to spread positiveness in the society and to make society more sensitive.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who transform the society.
It is easier to spread negativeness but a lot of good work is being done around us in the society and it is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
In every society, sports is of great importance.
When sports are played, the observer's mind also gets filled with energy.
We experience the names, identity and respect of the sportspersons.
However, sometimes there are many things behind it which go beyond sports and are bigger than sports.
I would like to talk about a daughter-in-law who has won a gold medal in the karate championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and is a resident of Anantnagar in Kashmir.
Hanaya studied karate with hard work and compassion and proved himself by observing it.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country to him for a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussions in the media about a 16-year-old daughter-in-law.
You must have read it too.
Rajni has won a gold medal in the Junior Women's Mukkabaji competition.
Rajni wins a medal and drinks a glass of milk at a stall of milk.
After that Rajini wrapped his medal in a cloth and put it in a bag.
You would have been wondering why Rajni drank a glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji, he sells lassi on a stall of Panipat.
Rajni said that his father has made a lot of sacrifice to bring him here.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning and his brothers and sisters woke up.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn Boxing before his father, his father encouraged him to get all possible assistance.
Rajni had to start booking with old songs because the economic condition of her family was not good at that time.
Despite all these scholars, they did not lose the courage of the silver and continued to learn the crown.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
I extend my best wishes and blessings to Rajni.
And I congratulate his parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for supporting Rajini and encouraging her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune has become the fastest Asian tourist from Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle to the world.
He used to drive about 300 km cycle everyday for 15 days.
Do we not get inspired by knowing this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we also inspire to show something in the midst of difficulties.
If the resolution is capable and full of enthusiasm then the obstacles are removed on their own.
Problems can never become obstacles.
If we hear many such examples then we also get a new inspiration every moment in our life.
My dear countrymen, in January, there are many festivals full of zeal and enthusiasm - like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi
During this time, the sun enters the Makar Rashi through the descending.
After this day the day begins to grow gradually and the harvesting of cold crops begins.
My best wishes to our food donor farmer brothers and sisters.
In diversity, the spirit of unity, Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is enriched by our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals and festivals are connected to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered to be different and there is one individual and equality.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
Besides festivals, there is a list of planet constellations.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is.
The date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon and sun calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun.
It depends on which calendar is considered.
Festivals are celebrated in many areas as per the condition of planet constellations.
Gudi Padwa, Chetichand and Ugadi are celebrated according to the moon calendar and all these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar of Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishak, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu.
Many of our festivals include the spirit of saving rivers and water.
Sixth festival - rivers and ponds are connected with sunrise.
Even on Makar Sankranti, millions of people immerse in sacred rivers.
Our festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand it has an archaeological significance, on the other hand, every festival learns the lessons of life - the inspiration to live with brotherhood with each other very easily.
I convey my best wishes to you all in the year 2019 and wish you enjoy the upcoming festivals.
Share the pictures taken on these festivals with all so that India's diversity and the beauty of Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, in our culture there is abundance of such things that we can proud and showcase the whole world with pride and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
It must have seen a lot about its magnificence and vastness in the films and it must have been true that the form of Kumbh is vast - the divine is as magnificent.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
The people of faith and devotion emerge in the Kumbh Mela.
Millions of people from across the country are connected at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is blossomed and blossomed by our great cultural heritage.
This time, on 15th January, the world famous Kumbh Mela will be organised in Prayagraj, which perhaps you all are waiting very eagerly.
Silsilo has already started to reach Saints and Mahatmas for the Kumbh Mela.
Its global significance can also be estimated by the fact that last year UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries saw the preparations for the Kumbh and the flags of several countries were hoisted together.
People from more than 150 countries are likely to visit this Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj.
With the divine divineity of Kumbh, India's grandeur will spread its color throughout the world.
This can be a great learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh are going on with a lot of enthusiasm.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for Kumbh.
There, I dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre to the nation and the devotees will get a lot of help in it.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If there will be cleanliness in the event, then its good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to worship Akshayvad after a sacred bath in the Sangam .
This Akshayvad was locked in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not visit.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
My appeal is to all of you that when you come to Kumbh, you must keep the pictures and pictures of the Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspiration to visit Kumbh.
The Kumbh of spirituality becomes the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
Destinations will also be the Kumbh of this Kumbh nationality.
This Kumbh of the devotees will also become the Mahakumbh of the world's tourists.
This Kumbh of artistics will also be the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Pujaya Bapu and South Africa have had an unbreakable relationship.
It was South Africa where Mohan became Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi had started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against differentiation.
He also established Phinix and Tolstoy Pharmaceuticals, where the echo of peace and justice echoed all over the world.
2018 - Nelson Mandela is also celebrated as the birth centenary year, also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of struggle against diversity all over the world and who was Mandela's inspiration
He got the tolerance and inspiration from Pujaya Bapu to spend so many years in jail.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals also encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP Conference was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the highest statue of the world is the Statue of Unity, there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen were discussed in detail.
During that time, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, which will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to ignore the integrity of India.
Sardar Saheb believed that the power of India lies in the diversity here.
We pay homage to Sardar Patel Ji through this Unity Award, respecting that spirit of Sardar Patelji.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, Guru Gobind Singh ji is a sacred festival.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
For a large part of his life, his workplace remained in North India and sacrificed his lives in Nanded, Maharashtra.
In Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India got their blessings.
If they see their lifetime, they get a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had gained the post of Guru at a young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice from Sikh Gurus in Varanasi.
He had a calm and simple personality, but whenever efforts were made to suppress the voice of the poor and the weaker, injustice was done to him then Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the weaker and that is why he says - more than one lakh fighters, Chidio Son Baj Tudauntbe Gobind Singh did not say
He said that strength cannot be exhibited by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human sufferings.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice, ritualism, who had an universal knowledge of both weapons and science.
He was a tricolor along with Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, Food Safety and Standard Authority of India is happening.
Several programs are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
A healthy India journey is going on across the country under the Eater Right India campaign.
The campaign will run till January 2.
India will also be prosperous when India becomes clean and healthy.
The most important for good health is nutritious food.
You also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, talk about mind again, be it life of a person, be it life of a nation, be it life of a society, inspiration is the basis of progress.
Let us move forward, move forward, change yourself, change the country too. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On October 3, 2014, the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, through Mann Ki Baat, we all started a journey together.
Mann Ki Baat today 50 applications have been completed.
Similarly, today this Golden Jubilee Apisod is the Golden Jubilee Apisod.
This time your letters and phones have come in the context of this 50th episode.
Likewise, on the Narendra Modi app, Monica Jain of Delhi, Bardwan, Present Government of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have asked about the same kind of question.
He says that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you like radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that in today's era when we had forgotten the radio then why did Modi come with a radio
I was a month and I was going to some other place traveling in the evening.
If the mountains of Himachal get cold in the evening then stay on the road for tea on a dhaba and when I ordered tea then before that, it was very small and only one person used to make tea and sell tea.
There was no cloth upstairs.
The same was standing on the edge of the rod with a small saliva.
He said, No, it is a matter of great happiness that you don't know what Saheb is.
I didn't understand anything, he said, Look, listen to the radio, it was being discussed on the radio.
The reach and depth of communication, perhaps no one can do the same as the radio.
This thing has been done in my mind since that time and I had realized the strength of this thing only.
So when I became a big prime minister, it was very natural to pay attention to the most powerful medium.
And when I assumed the charge as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I had the desire that the unity of the country, our magnificent history, its valour, the diversity of India, the serpents of our society, the serpents of the people, the penance, the sacrifice, the penance of the people should be made to the people.
From far-flung villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young professionals.
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these talents that are very interesting.
Of the people who have been surveyed, on average, 70 percent of them are people who listen to Mann Ki Baat regularly.
Most people feel that the biggest contribution of Mann Ki Baat is that it has increased the spirit of positiveness in the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, Jan Andolans have been encouraged at a large scale.
There has also been a comprehensive discussion on Indiapositive.
It is also a reflection of the spirit of positiveness and positiveness in the minds of our countrymen.
People have also said that Mann Ki Baat has increased the spirit of doing something with volunteerism.
Radio, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Live and Pariscop are also connected to Mann Ki Baat through Narendra Modi App.
I conclude my heartfelt gratitude to all the members of the Mann Ki Baat family for expressing confidence in it and becoming a part of it.
Your possibility is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and listens to the number of millions and millions, then what should he do
Some young friends studied on all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, they analyzed the word Apisod, lexical analysis, and studied how many times the word was spoken.
Which words were spoken repeatedly.
One of his stories is that this programme has been non-political.
When Mann Ki Baat was initiated, I had decided that there would be no politics in it, there would be no appreciation of the government, there would be no Modi in it and the biggest strength to fulfill my resolution, the biggest inspiration from you.
Modi will come and leave but this country will remain intact, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
It will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
And whenever there will be such a power of a government that the hustle-bustle of self-withdaughter will start from a small village in Haryana and spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, celebrities, everybody should be connected and in a new, modern language of thinking in the society, which today's generation understands.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat also joys but 130 crore Indians always live in my mind.
My heart is their mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government thing - it is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is a spiritual India, aspirational India.
India's original life is not politics, India's original life is not political.
The original life of India is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one side of politics.
It is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes the incidents and politics of politics lose so much that other talents and other male talents of the society are suppressed.
This is the collective responsibility of all of us and Mann Ki Baat is a humble and small effort in this direction.
Your question is an integrity question.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are asking questions not to the elder Prime Minister, as if one of your close friends is asking questions.
If I answer the questions you have asked, I will say that there is nothing.
Indeed, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Every time people's letters come before Mann Ki Baat.
People on MyGov and NarendraModi Mobile App describe their ideas. There is also a toll free number - 18000 11800.
Calling there, people also record their messages in their voice.
Whenever Mann Ki Baat comes closer, I read the ideas and information sent by you during the tour.
And for this reason, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with you.
Then, I recognise some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
Ask the truth, Mann Ki Baat has a voice but for examples, emotions and emotions are of my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat till now, but they keep sending their letters and their comments without being disappointed - your thoughts and your feelings have a lot of importance in my life.
I am confident that I will meet all of you more than before and will make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
It is also tried that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat should also be taken care of by the concerned departments on letters and suggestions.
With his hard work, Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
Akashwani team prepares every APISAD for broadcasting in many languages.
Some people efficiently listen to Modi in regional languages and Mann Ki Baat in the same ton.
Thus, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I also congratulate those people for their talent and skills.
I would urge you all to listen to this program in your local languages too.
I would also like to congratulate my friends of the media who broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels regularly every time.
No politics is ever happy with the media, he feels that he gets a very little coverage or the coverage that he gets is negative but the media has made many subjects raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Self with Doctor etc.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat will remain incomplete.
I really don't have any secret.
What I am doing is happening in all the families too.
In simple language, I try to slope myself, that young man, to make a harmony with his ideas and to make a wealth match.
This is the old bag of our lives, when it does not come in between then it becomes easier to understand anyone.
Today's youth do not do anything that they do not believe in themselves and when they believe in something then they leave everything behind it.
Many times people talk about communication gaps between adults and adults in families.
In fact, the interaction with youngsters in most of the families is very limited.
In most times, there is a hurdle in learning or habits or in the case of lifestyle, there is a hurdle in our taxes, in the case of open minds, gradually there is a lot of reduction in the family and it is also a matter of concern.
Discussing instead of access and discipline, the dialogue will be effective.
My efforts are being made to interact with the youth through different programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or thinking later.
They always have a repository of Idea.
They are extremely energetic, innovative and focused.
Through the Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts of the youth and their words more and more.
Many times there is a complaint that youngsters ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that young people question.
This is a good thing because it means that they want to examine all things from the roots.
Some people say that there is no patience in the youth, but I believe that there is no time for the youth to get married, this is the same thing that helps the youngsters to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that today's youth is very ambitious and thinks a lot of big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve great successes.
Finally, this is a New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I say what is wrong in it
He is relevant in multi-skiing, so he does this.
Whether it is social interpretership or start-ups or sports or any other field or society that brings a big change.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and dream big.
If we bring the ideas of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment to express them, they can bring positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vinita ji from Gurugram has written on Mai Gov that in Mann Ki Baat, I should talk about the Constituent Day coming tomorrow i. e.
He said that this day is special because we are entering the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vinayta ji, thank you for your suggestion.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The day to remember those great personalities who made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1947.
The Constituent Assembly took two years 11 months and 1 days to complete this historic work of constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great personalities gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace at which he built the Constitution is still an example of time management and productivity.
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a confluence of the great talents of the country, of which every person was committed to giving a Constitution to his country so that the people of India become empowered and the poorest of the poor also become empowered.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties i.e. rights and dutys have been detailed in detail.
The coordination of these two in the lives of the citizens will take the country forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will be protected by ourselves and thus, if we follow our duties given in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that when 60 years of India's republic was completed in 2010, in Gujarat, we had taken the shadow of the Constitution by placing it on elephants.
It was a memorable occasion to enhance awareness among the youth about the Constitution and connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
As a republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years and will complete 5 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all enhance the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, it can never be forgotten the contribution of the great man who was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
His Mahaparinirvana Divas is on 6th December.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given crores of Indians the right to live with respect.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say that the democratic values of India have not come from outside.
What is the republic and what is the parliamentary system - it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he called for a very emotional appeal that we should protect our freedom after such a struggle to the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be of different backgrounds, but we have to keep the country's interest on all things.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in the next year i. e.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, it was a great loss to Gurudwara, but the way the state government renovated it with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that sacred place of Guru Nanak Devji in Pakistan and Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, after 50 applications, we will meet once again in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I got the opportunity to keep the feelings behind this programme of Mann Ki Baat before you for the first time because you people asked the same questions, but our journey will continue.
The more you join, the more our journey will be deeper and will be satisfactory to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of the people that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
I would like to say today that one thing touches my mind in the talents of Mann Ki Baat. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat while sitting with all the families, it seems that the elders of our family are sitting and sharing their own words with us.
When I heard this thing in a comprehensive manner, I am amongst you, and in a way I will continue to be associated with you through Mann Ki Baat in the form of members of your family.
Your ambitions, my ambitions.
Let us further this journey.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, on 2nd January 14, the world's famous international magazine, Time Magazine, was the picture of Sardar Patel on the face of the edition published.
In his main store, he had printed a map of India and it was not a map that we see today.
It was a map of India divided into several parts.
Time Magazine wrote that there were threats like division, violence, food crisis, inflation and politics of power over India.
Time Magazine writes ahead that if anyone has the ability to celebrate the country in the form of unity and fill the wounds then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha.
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that farmers, labourers and entrepreneurs all trusted him.
Be it Junagarh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajwada of Rajasthan - those Sardar Patels whose swords and strategic skills we can see an India today.
We naturally commemorate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation bound in the bond of unity and our Mother India.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special. On this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel.
Established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is double from the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's tallest skyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's tallest statue is on the soil of India.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the land, will now enhance the beauty of the sky.
I salute the family of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why we celebrate this Infantry Day
This is the same day when the Indian Army had landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from the holes.
This historic event also has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was studying an old interview of Sam Manekshaw, who was a great military officer of India.
Field Marshal Manekshaw was remembering the time when he was Colonel in his interview.
During this period, the army campaign started in Kashmir on October 14.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was defeated for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir during a meeting. Sardar Patel looked at him in his special style during the meeting and said that there should be no delay in the military campaign in Kashmir and as soon as possible the solution should be taken.
After that, the soldiers flew to Kashmir Bhani aircraft and we saw how the army got success.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji is also the death anniversary.
He also paid homage to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, no one likes sports.
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Earlier, I got the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes of the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
In these sports, India won a total of 2 medals and made a new record and enhanced Indias pride.
I was fortunate to meet these talented para athletes personally and I congratulated them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that our youngsters have performed the best in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we also won three other medals in mix events besides 13 medals.
You must remember that this time India's performance in Asian Games was also excellent.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used the best words till now, the most glorious words.
This is the story of todays Indian sports that is touching new heights every day.
India is making new records not only in sports but also in those areas which never thought of.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who has won a gold medal for the country in the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He is Divyang since birth.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
Later, he spent eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a waiter in Dhaba to clean DTC buses and roadside in Delhi to drive a life car.
Today, the same Narayan International event has been winning a gold medal for India.
Not only this, India has never won any Olympic medal in Judo, be it Senior Level or Junior Level.
But Tababi Devi won a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics and created history.
Tababi Devi, a 16-year-old young player, is a resident of a village in Manipur.
His father is a labourer when his mother works for selling fish.
Many times there was a time before his family when he had no money for food.
Even in such circumstances, the courage of Tababi Devi will not be driven.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are numerous stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that we had successfully organized the FIFA Under-1 World Cup in 2017.
The entire world also appreciated it as a successful tournament.
A new record was also created in the Fifa Under 19 World Cup about the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums in the country and increased the courage of young sportspersons.
This year, India has been fortunate to organize Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian, whether it is sports or it is interested in any sports, must have an engagement with Hockey in his mind.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has won gold medals in many competitions and once the World Cup wins.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
Whenever Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great sportsmen of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is familiar with the whole world.
After him, Hockey has cut a big journal from Balwinder Singh Sinior, Lesley Cladius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, the sportspersons of Team India are inspiring the new generation of Hockey by their hard work and engagement.
For sports lovers there is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only enhance the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey team for this competition and assure them that 125 crore Indians stand with them and their support and wish all the teams of the world to come to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, they are becoming self-servicemen, they are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new age, new generations, new zeals, new zeals and new dreams, these things are coming forward today.
Every Indian will be proud of the zeal and passion they have for this work.
It has a fragrance in the journey from IT to society, I don't do it, I don't do it, I don't do it, I don't know.
Somebody is teaching children and somebody is teaching the elderly.
If someone is associated with cleanliness then someone is helping the farmers and there is no desire to do all that but it has a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man learned a wheelchair basketball by himself to help the Divyangs wheelchair basketball team.
This is the dedication that this is the activity with this mission.
Will no Indian be proud of this
This feeling of I am not ham will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was looking at your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat, I got a very interesting tip of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He wrote on MyGov: Please talk about how the customs and traditions of the tribals of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
For sustainable development, we need to learn some of their traditions in our lives.
I appreciate you for keeping this subject among the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a subject that inspires us to look towards our glorious past and culture. Today the entire world, especially the countries of the West, are discussing environmental protection and finding new paths for balanced life.
However, even our India is not free from this problem, but to resolve it, we have to do so, to see our rich history and traditions, especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature has been involved in the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Central India, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship the trees like Pipala and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Bishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
Especially in the context of conservation of trees, they are acceptable to sacrifice their lives, but they are not allowed to harm a single tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal claims to have a relationship with the tigers.
They consider him to be his brother and sister Suddha.
Even in Nagaland, tigers are seen as protectors of forests.
The people of the Varali community in Maharashtra consider the tiger as guests and the presence of tigers for them is prosperous.
There is a belief in the coal community in Central India that their fortune is associated with the tigers and if the tiger does not get food then the village will also have to be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the river Kethan during the season of convocation.
They consider these areas as a refugee place for fish and they get healthy and abundant quantity of fish.
Tribal communities make their homes with natural materials and are strong and environment friendly.
In the solitary regions of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small roaming community is traditionally made up of things available at the local level.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with very peaceful and mutual interactions, but when someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that the first of our freedom fighters was the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who struggled hard against the British rule to protect his wild land.
The list of what I have said is very long. There are many examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and today the country is dedicated to our tribals for the wealth of forests.
Let us express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing something extraordinary for the society.
Such works which seem to be normal at first glances but in reality they have a strong impact in changing our mindset and changing the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother of Punjab Gurubachan Singh ji.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to the daughter of Gurubachan Singh ji.
Before this marriage, Gurubachan ji had said that we will marry with simplicity.
There is no need to spend any jewellery or other things.
You will be surprised to know that Bhai Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, what he said, what he said, what he said, which is the true strength of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told him that you promise me that now you will not burn palm in the field.
You can imagine how much social strength is there in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji feels very simple but he shows how big his personality is and we have seen that there are many families in our society that transform the personal occasion into the occasion of social interest.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh has set up such an example before us.
I have read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near the navel.
Congratulations to brother Gurubachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and all those places who make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You all are moving the Indian heritage of healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just as TPTPA lakes are built, small awareness and activeness and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our texts:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Establish peace everywhere in the heart, in the stars, in the particles of the world.
This year, 11th November is a special significance for India as the first World War ended 100 years before today on 11th November, which is completing 100 years i.e. a century of heavy destruction and loss of lives will also be completed.
First World War for India was an important event.
In fact, we would not have been able to take it directly with the war.
Nevertheless, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and made supreme sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed to the world that when war comes, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery in remote areas and in odd circumstances.
There was only one goal behind all of them - the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world witnessed the destruction of the world.
According to estimates, about one crore soldiers and almost the same civilians lost their lives.
It understands the importance of peace all over the world.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war.
From terrorism to change in environment, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our Ishaan India is something else.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unique and the people there are extremely talented.
Our ISHAN India is now known for its best practices.
ISHAN India is an area that has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that the awards given for the best policy formulation in this sector are equal to Oscar in this field.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind the 51 nominee policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, it is on the end of October.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for all these festivals.
I would urge you to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity for you to move forward as a mission and take a solemn resolve.
Your progress is a key part of the progress of the country.
The progress of the country will be as much as you progress.
My best wishes to you all.
