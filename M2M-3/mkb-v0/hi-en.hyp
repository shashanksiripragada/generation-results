Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that it does not include only the Indian community, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens there, the social organization there celebrate Diwali with full joy.
in a way India stands there .
Friends, Festival Tourism is its own attraction in the world.
Our India, which is the Country of Festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
Our effort should be to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, and to include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
We have so many different festivals in every state, every region. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in enhancing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the matter of the previous mind we had decided that we would do something different on this Deepawali.
I had said, let us all celebrate the women power and their achievements of India on this Deepawali, that is, the respect of Lakshmi of India.
And see, immediately after that, there was a number of inspirational stories on social media.
Karangal's Kodipaka Ramesh wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me .
Everything is for me and that is the Lakshmi of India in the right sense
Ramesh ji, my salute to your mother
Geetika Swami, who is activated on Twitter, says that for him Major Aroma Kanwar is Lakshmi of India who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and he led the All-Women team of Assam Riles.
For poetry Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi is his daughter, who is also his strength
He is proud that his daughter makes the best painting
He has also obtained a very good rank in the ATM examination
At the same time Megha Jain ji has written that a 92-year-old woman of Ninty Two Year, for years, gives free water to the passengers at Gwalior railway station.
Megha ji, this is inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people
You must read, take inspiration and share something similar to yourself and I respectfully bow down to all the Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honamma, he wrote a poem in the 17th century, in the Kannada language, that feeling, that word, every Lakshmi of India, what we are talking about or not
It looks like his foundation was built in the 17th century.
How good words, how good feelings and how good ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidannupannida Jankarayanu Jasuvalidanu (Penninda permegondanu himavantanu.Penninda broohu parchidannu penninda jankarayanu jasuvalendanu i.e. Himavant i.e. , due to his daughter Parvati , Rishi Bharugu , due to his daughter Laxmi and Raja Janak got fame because of his daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and from the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, this is the day on 12th November, 2019 that the 550th light festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated across the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanakdev ji
I can never forget my visits to the gurudwaras in Vancover and Tehran
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanakdev ji that I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept service paramount
Guru Nanakdev believed that there could be no price for service work done in a selfless manner .
They stood firmly against social evil like touching
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji conveyed his message in the world, to far-flung
He was one of the most travelers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, his simplicity, humility and simplicity won the heart of everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made several important religious visits, which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they, north or south, east or west, went everywhere to meet people, saints and sages.
It is believed that the well-known Saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar
There is a sacred place in Kashi, Gurubagh Gurudwara. It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Devji stayed there.
He also went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Travels to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Sri Lanka in the South
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which also reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji also visited the north, Kashmir and its surroundings.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also went to Tibet, where the people, considered him a guru
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan, where they traveled
During one of his sadness, he also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arabia, III.
Just a few days ago, Ambassador of 85 countries from Delhi to Amritsar had visited Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this was marked by the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Devji .
All these Ambassadors visited the Golden Temple there, they also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
After this, many Ambassadors also shared their pictures on social media with great pride to good experiences
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of 31st October.
Sardar Patel used to look at fine things too in depth.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was also expert in organization skills .
He was mastered in preparing and formulating strategies
When he reads, listens to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, he knows how tremendous his planning was.
In 1921, there were thousands of delegates from all over the country to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements of the session
He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to make khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
Inserting shoes in these bags, keeping with them, the tension of theft of shoes from the mind of the delegates ended.
On the other hand , Khadi sales also increased significantly .
Our country, Sardar Patel will always be grateful for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly
He did an important task to ensure fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, has done a great Bhagirath and historic work to unite the princely states.
Indeed, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in integration of the country is discussed only in certain provinces.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour looked at Lakshadweep and sent a ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got information about this, he lost time, without delay, immediately, started harsh action.
Immediately after his order the tricolor was hoisted there , and the neighbours of Lakshadweep were destroyed .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar brothers to ensure personally that Lakshadweep gets all necessary help for development
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to the progress of India.
This is also an attractive tourist destination
I hope you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, on the day of 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the tallest statue in the world .
The Statue of Liberty located in the United States is also double in height
The world ' s tallest statue fills every Indian with pride
Every Indian ' s head rises very high .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that on an average every day eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity .
The faith and devotion that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has been expressed in his heart and now there are several centres of attractions like factus gardens, butterly gardens, Jungle Sari, Children Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery and local economy are being promoted and people are getting new opportunities for employment.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villages are providing home-stay facilities to their homes.
Professional training is also being given to people providing home state facilities
The people there have now started cultivation of ragon ruit and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there .
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witness to how one place within a year, develops as a world famous tourism destination
There people come from abroad and abroad
A lot of arrangements for transportation, staying, guides, eco-friendly arrangements are being developed by themselves.
Very big economy is developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirement of passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Integration Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us a message to protect our country at every cost of unity, integrity and security.
Run for Unity is being organized every time on 31st October.
It will include people from every section of the society, every section of the society.
Run for Unity symbolizes this, this country is running in one direction and wants to achieve a goal
One goal - Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat
The last five years have been seen - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centers, in small tier-to-tier-three cities, there are very large numbers of males, women, people of the city, people of the villages, children, youth, elderly people and Divyangjans.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting to see a hobby and june about marathon.
Run for Unity is also a similar unique project
Running is beneficial for mind and brain and body all .
I have to run here too.
Besides, we are also associated with Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat this purpose.
And that's why not just the body, but the mind and the rituals to bring India to new heights for the unity of India
And that's why you can know about the run for unity around you, wherever you live in the city
This portal has been informed about places across the country where run for unity is to be organized
I hope all of you will run on 31st October - for India's unity, for your own fitness too.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country in the form of unity
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every point, at every point, at every point, at every point.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to enhance the harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution, the memory panel becomes very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court ruled Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of those circumstances in their own way.
What kind of language was spoken to create warmth in the atmosphere
But all this, five days, seven days, ten days, continued, but, as soon as the decision came, a pleasant, surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand everything was done for warmth for two weeks but when the decision was taken on Ram Janmabhoomi, then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day , I feel happy .
Honoured the dignity of the judiciary very proudly and did not allow anywhere to become an atmosphere of heat, tension
These things should always be remembered , it gives us great strength .
That day, that moment, it is a duty for all of us.
This is an example of the voice of unity, the strength of the country.
I pay homage to them today
My dear countrymen, today, if one story of every household is heard away, one story of every village is heard - from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, from every corner of India, then it is a sanitation story.
But there is also a pleasant experience and interesting experience
I hear, I think, I'll tell you, too.
You imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature goes to minus 50-60 degrees minus
The air also contains only the name of the oygen
In such a opposite circumstances, living in such challenges is not less than any heroism.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries of the country by chesting, but also running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I appreciate the countrymen for this amazing commitment of the Indian Army.
I am grateful
There's so cold that it's difficult to decompose anything
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, 130 tons of waste is removed from the glacier and its surrounding areas and that too is a great service between the ragil ecosystem here.
We all know that this Siachen is a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water , so running a cleanliness campaign here means ensuring clean water for those who live in lower areas .
Also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that awakens a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially buying something or the other, bringing something from the market, it happens in less and more quantity in every family.
I once said we should try - buy local things
If we meet our village then there is no need to go to the tehsil
If you meet in Tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
The more we will try to buy our local things, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging the weavers to buy something or the other by the hands of our weavers, by the hands of our khadi people.
Even in this Diwali, you must have bought a lot before Diwali but there are many people who think that if you go after Diwali then you will probably get a little cheaper.
And there will be many who will have yet to buy .
So along with the best wishes of Deepawali, I would urge you to come and buy local things.
Look, how important we can play in realizing Mahatma Gandhi's dream
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you on this holy festival of Deepawali.
We use various firecrackers in Diwali
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
Somewhere injury occurs
I urge you all to handle yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Shall He control his own life and luck
Remember that Jantar of revered Bapu
Can we imagine which citizen of my country will benefit from what I ' m buying
Today the whole country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious festival
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is considered to be a symbol of sister and brother ' s mutual love and faith .
This festival has also been a major example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many such stories in the history of the country, in which one defense formula had linked two different states or people associated with religion to the door of faith.
Just a few days later the festival of Janmashtami is going to come
The entire atmosphere is going to resonate with elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal, Govinda-Govinda.
The natural joy of swinging colored in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Besides Raksha Bandhan Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in tolerating, riding and reaching this great heritage to the common man.
India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all are proud of the fact that from Vedic to present, Sanskrit language has also played a big role in the propaganda of knowledge.
The repository of knowledge related to every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, astronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, it is said that the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global warming is described in detail in our Vedas.
All of you will be happy to know that the residents of Mattoor village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
Sometimes they use lions and poets but those who are familiar with Sanskrit auspicious people know that in very little words such a perfect statement is made from Sanskrit auspicious people and secondly it is very easy to understand because they are connected to our soil and our tradition.
Like to explain the importance of the guru in life, it has been said - although Aksharamastu, Guru: disciple Prabodhyet
We all celebrate the upcoming Teachers Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day .
I extend my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and also congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
Trees and plants scorching from severe heat provide relief to dry reservoirs but sometimes it also brings high rainfall and devastating floods.
Nature has become such a situation that in some places there has been more rain than other places
Severe floods in Kerala have badly affected people's lives
Today, in these difficult circumstances, the whole country stands with Kerala
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, the loss of their lives cannot be compensated but I want to assure the bereaved families that hundred and fifty crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those who are injured in this natural calamity will be healthy as soon as possible.
I am confident that Kerala will be resurrected soon with the zeal and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is doing something at their own level so that wherever there is objection, be it Kerala or the districts of India and the areas, peoples lives can be normal again.
All Ease Groups and people associated with every working sector are contributing to it.
Everyone has been trying to ensure that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be minimized, we share their sorrows.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They left no stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I also want to mention the hard work of the NRC personnel
In this moment of crisis he has done a great job .
Efforts to meet the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions have become a new center of faith for every Indian
Yesterday was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country and especially Kerala so that they can recover from this disaster at the earliest and get the development journey of Kerala at the earliest.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of other parts of the country that the entire country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to talk about the mind
Then the topic that people from all over the country wrote is the topic of all of us, Shriman Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Gaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many number of people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone drowned in mourning
A nation leader who left the prime minister 14 years ago
In a way he had gone far away from active politics for the past 10 years
They were not seen anywhere in the news, they did not appear publicly
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the country.
People have remembered and remembered him as the best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act 2 Thousand Three
This change made two significant changes in India's politics
First , the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats .
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law increased from one-third to two-thirds
Along with this, clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of parties.
For many years, the political culture of setting up a huge cabinet in India was made to please the politicians not only for the distribution of big jambo cabinet work but also for the pleasure of politicians.
Atal ji changed it
His move saved money and resources
Along with this, efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji, who changed the situation and healthy traditions grow in our political culture
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure, the time of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, according to the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening because at that time it was time for Parliament to start in London.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am
Many such rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places
This led to more and more Indians getting the opportunity to hoist their national flag
In this way he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the common man .
Likewise, nowadays you are seeing that discussions about the elections of the Center and the States together in the country are moving forward.
People are keeping their point in both sides and opposition to this subject
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy
I would surely say that for healthy democracy, developing good traditions for good democracy, striving to strengthen democracy, pursue discussions with open mind, it will also be an excellent tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his commitment to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay homage to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Just a few days ago the monsoon session of Parliament has ended
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 and the Rajya Sabha is 74
Emerging above the Dalhit, all MPs tried to make the monsoon session more useful and consequently the Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and welfare of youth
Several important bills that benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all knew that for decades there was a demand for creating a BCC commission just like the STC Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of forming the BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right.
This step will prove to be carrying forward the objective of social justice
The work of passing the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes also took place in this session
This law will further protect the interests of SC and ST community
It will also prevent criminals from atrocities and believe in Dalit communities
No civilized society can tolerate any injustice against the country ' s women power
The country is not ready to tolerate the culprits of rape, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and made a harsh punishment.
The culprits of rape will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls under 12 years of age
A few days ago, you must have read in the newspapers, a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits after just five days of hearing
Rajasthan has also made similar decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
Though this session of the Rajya Sabha has not been possible , I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly with them to get justice .
When we move forward in the interest of the country, the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived can be changed.
This time everyone has presented an ideal in the monsoon session.
These days millions of countrymen are focused on Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the players who won the medal for the country.
I extend my best wishes to those players whose competitions are yet to be held.
India's players, especially in shooting and restling, are performing excellent, but our players are also bringing medals in those games in which our performance has not been so good before, such as sports like Hushu and Rowing - these are not medals - are evidence - Indian sports and sportspersons touching the sky and dreams
Our daughters in large numbers are among those who win medals for the country and this is a very positive sign - even our young players who win medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a very good indication that most of the players who have won the medals are residents of small towns and villages and these people have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, I extend my best wishes to all sports lovers and pay my homage to the great hockey sportsperson Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness as a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day
Hello, I respect your feelings
All of us have seen buildings and houses from brick stones, but can you imagine that almost twelve-two years ago a huge mountain, which was just a single stone mountain, was given the form of an excellent, vast and wonderful temple - perhaps it is difficult to imagine, but it happened and it is a temple - Kailashnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra
If someone tells you about a thousand years ago a column of Granite was built more than 60 meters long and nearly 80 tons of Granite was placed on its summit - will you believe
But, the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mile of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everybody is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
Land Engineering Laboratory of India
There were many engineers in India who made unimaginable imaginable and presented examples of miracles in the world of engineering
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose works are still amazing the people and they were Bharat Ratna Dr. M.
In that part of the country, he is revered, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In memory of them , September 15 is made as Engineers Day .
Following his footprints, our country's engineers have made their own identity all over the world
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, I remember an event of the horrific earthquake that took place in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
At that time I used to work there as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years of age and she was laughing at me, and she was saying, "Look, this is my house - this is my brother-in-law in Kutch, I said, this house has seen 3-3 earthquakes.
But there is no harm to you anywhere
This house was built by our ancestors according to the nature of this place, according to the environment here and he was saying this so proudly, I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had composed according to the local conditions that caused the common man to stay safe
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future
Workshops should be done at the location
In the changing age what new things we have to learn
The world is battling natural disasters
So what is the new form of structural engineering
What are his courses
What to teach students
How did ero waste become our priority
Many such things when the engineers celebrate Day , we must think
There is an atmosphere of festivals and along with this the preparations for Diwali also start .
We will continue to meet in the matter of mind, will continue to talk about mind and we will continue to mobilize the country with our minds.
My best wishes to all of you with this spirit
Thank you
will meet again
These days there are reports of good rainfall in many places .
At some places there is also news of concern due to heavy rains and at some places people are still waiting for rains
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rains also show the form of preference and dislike, but what do we blame the rain, human beings who have chosen the path of struggle with nature and consequences that sometimes nature gets stuck on us.
And that is why we become nature lovers, we become the protector of nature, we become the promoter of nature, we remain balanced in the things that nature has.
In the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind
All of you must have seen on TV, 12 teenage football players team in Thailand and their coach went to the cave to roam around
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day , luck was more .
When they went inside the cave for a long time , suddenly due to heavy rains , a lot of water accumulated near the gate of the cave .
You can imagine when death appears in front of adolescence and you have to spend moments then how will they be
On one hand, he was struggling with the crisis, on the other hand, humanity was united in the whole world and was expressing God's human properties.
People around the world were praying to take these children out safely
Everyone, be it the government or the parents of these children, be it their family members, be it media, be it citizens of the country - everyone has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
All the people were engaged in their mission as a team
In this entire operation, a naval personnel of Thailand lost their lives.
The whole world is amazed at the fact that despite such a difficult situation , he did not give up his hope with such bravery and patience in a dark cave full of water .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things.
We just need to pay attention to our goal with a calm and stable mind, work for it.
In the past, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us
Neeraj ji had a special feature - hope, trust, determination, faith in himself
By the way, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth
Because this is the time when colleges have the peak season
Millions of young people like Satyam come out of school and go to colleges
If it goes to February and March Teams, Papers, answers, then along with enjoying the holidays of April and May, results, deciding further directions in life, career office is consumed in this regard.
July is the month when youngsters take steps in the new phase of their life when they go away from focus extensions and go on the cut-off
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel
Students come into the shadow of professionals from the shadow of Parents
I am sure my young friends will be very excited and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time going out of the house, going out of the village, getting out of a protective environment, one has to become one of his own partners.
For the first time so many young people leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students have so far joined their colleges, some will be joining.
I will tell you that be calm, enjoy life, enjoy the inner enjoyment in life.
There is no fodder without books, it has to be studied, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, making and maintaining new friends, it is a great sense of understanding in itself.
Learn some new, such as new skills, learn new languages
Those youngsters who have left their homes and have gone to study at some other place, discover those places, know about them, the people there, the language, the culture and the tourist destinations there.
Introducing a new innings. My best wishes to all youngsters
His father nurtures his family by waste.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who are from the poor family and they have done something with their hard work and passion in spite of the opposite circumstances that inspires us all
Betia Afreen Sheikh of Ahmedabad, whose father runs auto rickshaw, Nagpur's daughter is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick-bricks
Ramesh himself used to sell toys at the fair or the Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spinal muscular atrophy since birth, all of them have achieved such a success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and enthusiasm.
If we look around us, we will get many such examples
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite to the sky, I have to call every darkness in the light, I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers, and to wake up the mountains of the song, my dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a news, I wrote - two youths have dreamed of Modi
The incident was that once the city of San Jose, which is known as a technology hub, I was discussing with Indian youth
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and take time out and do something
I had appealed to convert brain-rain into brain-gain
Using his professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have prepared a SmartGaon App.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile.
This village of Rae Bareli, residents of Taudhakpur, Gram-Pradhan, District Magistrate, all people made people aware about the use of this app.
If you look at this event closely then one thing will be noticed that he is living in the youth of America, his lifestyle and thoughts are living in the middle of him. He must have left India several years ago but still he knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is connected to the village.
That's why he could probably make the village something according to what he wants.
The feeling of doing something for our village, its roots and connectivity is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to situations, a slight ash gets accumulated on it, but if a small spark gets touched, then all things emerge once again and they bring it towards their past days.
It has not happened even in our case, the situation, the situation, the distances have not separated us anywhere, the ashes have not got stuck.
Santosh ji thanks very much for your phone hall
Indeed Pandharpur is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this time, is also celebrated as a magnificent result of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Almost 15 - 20 days before Ashadi Ekadashi i . . pilgrims go on foot with the palanquins to travel to Pandharpur .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of warriors
Keeping the paduka of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram in the palanquin, Vithal-Vitthal sings, dances, playing on foot towards Pandharpur
Tirthankaras god Vithal, who is also called Vithova or Pandurang, reach there for their darshan
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
Going to Vithova Temple in Pandharpur and there is a different experience of glory, beauty, spiritual joy .
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Wari once you get the opportunity
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - Innumerable saints are still educating the common man in Maharashtra
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and this saint tradition has been inspiring in every corner of India .
Whether it is their burden or disillusionment, we get an important message of harmony, love and brotherhood from them.
It gets the mantra of fighting society with faith against superstition
These were the people who prevented the society from time to time, showed the toka and mirror and ensured that the old evils end from our society and the rites of compassion, equality and purity in the people.
Our Indo-Bhoomi Bahuratna is Vasundhara, as a great tradition of saints lived in our country, in the same way, the great men dedicated to Maa-Bharati, sacrificed their lives and dedicated to this land.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and intellect to show the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing
I want to put an interesting event associated with Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad in front of the countrymen today.
When Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people welcomed him in Ahmedabad about a hundred years ago and during his visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with him and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on August 01, 1920, he had decided that he would build his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose Dictoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this Dictoria Garden was named after the UK ueen
Finally, the statue became ready and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it from Mahatma Gandhi, not from anyone else, but from 28 February 1929 - It is a matter of great fun, in that inauguration ceremony, revered Bapu said in that speech that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got one person but also got the courage that has made it possible to build Tilak ji's statue.
And my dear countrymen, the speciality of this statue is that it is a rare statue of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, just below Tilak, Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji, the tradition of public Ganesh Festival started
The Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of traditional devotion and festivals as well as social awareness, collectiveness, harmony and equality among the people.
At the same time it was a time when it was necessary that the country should be united to fight against the British, these festivals worked to unite everyone while breaking the barriers of caste and sect.
Over time the popularity of these events increased
This shows that our ancient legacy and our heroes of history are still crying in our younger generation.
Today in many cities it happens that you get to see Ganesh Pandal in almost every street.
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop them within themselves.
I had also requested the last time and when I am remembering Lokmanya Tilak Ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival, celebrate Ganesh with great fanfare, celebrate with joy but urge you to celebrate Eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the adornment items, everything is eco-friendly and I would like every city to have different competitions for Eco-friendly Ganesh Festival. I would like to give them rewards and I would like that on MyGov and on the Narendra Modi App, things of eco-friendly Ganesh Festival should be kept for extensive promotion.
I will surely convey your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen , he gave a slogan Swaraj is our birth right and we will remain with us .
Today it is time to say that Swaraj is our right to birth and we will be taking it
Every Indian must reach the good results of good governance and development
I am talking about Chandrashekhar Azad
In India, who will be such a young man who will not be inspired to hear these lines, Sarfroshi's desire is now in our heart, see how strong is in the hands of these lines inspired many youths like Ashfaq Allah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad
Chandrashekhar Azad's bravery and his passion for freedom, it inspired many youths
Azad put his life on the bet, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
It was my privilege that I had the privilege of visiting the village of Alirajpur in Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage and homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not even want to die with the bullets of foreigners - if he lives, he would fight and die, he would die after being free.
Once again I salute the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, 400 meters race in the junior under-20 World Athletics Championship running in Inland, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has created history by winning gold medals in that competition.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, responded to my letter to Indonesia, she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
-Mail writes unity in any athlete's life is the most important moment when he holds the tricolor and I am proud that I have done it
Unity we all are proud of you
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity wins Gold and Brone Medals in World Para Athletics Grand Pri 2018 in Tunisia
His achievement is particularly because he made his challenge a means of success .
In 2003, due to road accident, half the lower part of his body failed, but this daughter did not lose courage and achieved this position while strengthening herself.
Another Divya Yogesh Kathunia ji has won a gold medal by winning a gold medal in Para Athletics Grand Price in Berlin and Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won a gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, many events in the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes due to weather diseases also enter the house.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for several centuries of celebrations.
Again , you will surely get the word of the mind .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to be with you once again in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Just a few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bengaluru
You must have understood well that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan
This was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India
In this match, both the teams performed excellent and one of the other Afghanistan baller Rashid Khan had done excellence this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me and wrote on his Twitter that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan
He's the base of the world of cricket and along with that he doesn't write in a little funny fashion that we're not going to give him to anyone
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well this was the first match so remembering is very natural but I will remember this match for a particular reason
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winner team do when Indian team takes trophy
- While taking the trophy, the Indian team of Afghanistan, which was playing international matches for the first time, invited Afghanistan team and both teams took photographs together
What happens to sportsman spirit, what happens to sportsmanship - we can experience this one incident
The skills of our youth to unite the sports society and find out the talent they have.
My dear countrymen, this was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day on June 21.
The whole world came together
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, Japanese naval ships, people can see yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia there was a historic programme of Yoga and I am told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
Indo-China soldiers simultaneously practiced yoga at the high snowy peaks of Ladakh
Yoga works to break and add all boundaries
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond all distinctions of caste, religion, region, color or gender and made this opportunity a big festival
If people from all over the world were so excited and participating in the Yoga Day programmes, why would it not be multiplied in India
Our IAF warriors surpassed everyone by doing yoga at a height of 15 thousand feet from the earth in the middle of the sky .
The view was that they swimming in the air, not sitting in the plane
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has been done everywhere.
Yoga has worked to unite people from all over the world, beyond caste, creed and geography, the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have lived for centuries.
Our sages, sages, saints, who always insist on, Yoga has proved it in true sense.
Maximum people will make it a part of their lives
Many people on MyGov and NarendraModiApp have written to me that I should talk about this time's Mann Ki Baat about the Doctors Day coming on 1st July - right
We are those people who naturally worship Mother as God, believe equal to God because Mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, and many times doctors regenerate us.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor has a medical experiment, and he has a deep experience of the impact of general lifestyle trends on our health.
Indian doctors have recognized their capabilities and skills all over the world
Excellent in medical profession, hardworking as well as our doctors are known to solve complex medical problems
We are lucky people who are born in this land of India
India has a prosperous history when there is no such month, there is no day in which no historical event has happened
See, everywhere in India has its own heritage
There is a saint connected there, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has his own contribution, his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, Kabirvad of Gujarat is well known to you.
When I used to work there, I also had a big national session of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas ji went to Magahar
At that time there was a belief that those who die in Maghar do not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Magahar was considered to be indecent but Saint Kabirdas did not believe it .
Such evil deeds and superstitions of their time they broke , and so they became magnificent , and they took their graves .
Sant Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and duals
That was his ideals
In his compositions we get to see this ideal and in today's era they are equally inspiring
The true Pir saint is the one who knows and understands the sufferings of others, who do not know the sufferings of others, they are ruthless
Kabirdas ji had given special emphasis on social harmony
They thought far ahead of their time .
Put it off, please do all the coal
Kabir writes in another Doha - where mercy is a religion, where greed is a sin
He said: - Do not ask caste sadhu, ask knowledge
This is the greatness of the Guru and one such Guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed sensitivity to the people, keep inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is God's service.
Wherever they went they took several initiatives for the welfare of the society .
The arrangement of kitchen free from social discrimination where a person of every caste, creed, religion or sect could come and eat food, Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to be associated with enthusiasm and zeal
I urge all of you to commemorate the 550th Light Festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the entire society and around the world, what are the new ideas, what are the new suggestions, what are the new imaginations and what are the new imaginations
My dear countrymen
The struggle for India's independence is very long, is very wide, is very deep and is filled with innumerable martyrdoms.
There is another history associated with Punjab
In 2019, even 100 years of the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh that embarrassed the entire humanity
We can all think about how to complete 100 years of this incident, but we should always remember the immortal message given by this incident, this violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini of Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that on July 6, is the birthday of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman ji first thank you very much
It was very good to see your interest in the history of India .
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23
Very few people would know that at the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation in Bengali language at Kolkata University.
This was the first time that the British ruled and someone at Kolkata University addressed the convocation in Bengali language.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone of Indias industrial development, prepared a strong base, prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, efficient and prosperous in every field
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industries.
He was quite passionate about the development of West Bengal
Their understanding, discretion and activism is the result of that part of Bengal could be saved and it is still part of India.
The most important thing for Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's integrity and unity - and for this, he lost his life at the age of 52.
We should always remember the message of the unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood, for the progress of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the Government through video call.
Going beyond files, I got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people directly from them.
People told about their resolution, their happiness and sorrow, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me, but it was a different kind of learning experience and what could happen in anybody's life of greater satisfaction than the pleasure that was seen on the faces of the people during this period
When he used to hear the stories of a common man, the story of his experience was touching the heart.
Betia Common Service Centre in remote villages is providing services from the pension of the elderly people of villages to the construction of passports.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh collects Sitaphal and makes her office-cream and do business
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people are running medicine centers in the country as well as going to nearby villages and providing cheap medicines
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two to three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business.
Not only this, ten to fifteen people are also giving more jobs
Here students of Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on import topics like waste management in the school's tinkering lab at their young age.
Do not know how many stories were there in any corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success
In such an environment, when the common man (human) comes with new hope, new zeal and incidents in his life, then he is not credited by the government.
The incident of a small girl in a remote village also becomes a motivation for hundred and fifty crore countrymen.
With the help of technology, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant, very inspiring and it gives me satisfaction to work, but it also gives an impetus to do more work.
Another new joy of living for the poorest of the poor, another new zeal, another new inspiration.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined the video bridge programme and you have worked to give me a new strength.
I want to thank you all once again
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere something would be good.
There are people who do good
We can also experience the aroma of goodness
One thing came to me in the past and this is a very unique combination
On the one hand where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand our farmer brothers and sisters associated with farming are there.
He has set up a comfortable prosperity trust in collaboration with the T engineers and has taken this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Connected to farmers, schemes were made and made successful efforts to increase the income of farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with this .
On the one hand , farmers have a major role in the entire chain from crop product to marketing , on the other hand , efforts are made to ensure the participation of farmers in profits .
Separate seed-bank has been made for good crops, good breed seeds for them.
Women see the functioning of this sead-bank, women have also been added
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the professionals, technocrats and engineering world have come out of their scope to connect with the farmers, to connect with the village, to connect with the fields and the Khalihans.
Once again, some people will not know, some people will not know, some people will not know, but some people of my country are doing something or the other good, all of them my best wishes.
GST will complete one year, one nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country, it has become a reality today.
One Nation One Tax Reform, for this, if I have to credit anybody at the highest, then I give credit to the states.
GST is an excellent example of cooperative federalism, where all the states together took a decision in the country's interest and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of GST Council have been held and we can be proud that people of different political ideologies sit there, people of different states sit there, states with different priorities, but despite all the decisions taken in the GST Council so far, all of them have been done unanimously.
Before GST, 17 different types of taxes used to be done in the country but now only one tax is implemented in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and is also a celebration of honesty
In the first country, complaints of Inspectorraj used to come in the case of a lot of tax
Everything from return to return happens through online information technology
With the introduction of GST, check posts have ended and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but also getting a lot of benefit in the logistics sector.
GST may be the world's largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform success in India was achieved because people of the country adopted it and ensured the success of GST only through manpower.
Usually it is believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to stabilize it completely but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country, the celebration of the integrity of the people's participation is the result of the participation of the people's power that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it continues to improve its inbuilt system according to the requirement.
Once again you got the opportunity to be the most compassionate through the talk of mind
You will be very reminded of the 6 women commanders of the Navy, this team was on a sea journey for the last several months.
boat sagar circumambulation - G - I want to talk something about them
These six daughters of India, their team has made more than two hundred hundred and city our days - more than 250 days through the sea.
NS Tarini has returned to India on 21st May and welcomed him very warmly
He travelled around twenty thousand nautical miles through various oceans and many seas
This was one of the first events in the world itself
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters, listen to their experiences.
I once again congratulate these daughters for their adventure, for enhancing the prestige of the Navy, for enhancing India's honour and especially for the world that the daughters of India are not less.
Who does not know the sense of adventure
If we see the development journey of mankind then there has been progress in the womb of some adventure.
Development is born in the lap of adventure .
The intention to do something, to do something away from the leak, to do some area ordinary, I can do something - these feelings, those who do something, may be less, but for ages, people get inspiration.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra climbed the highest peak of the world by Tribal Students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam
These students of Ashram-School started training in August 2017, Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh - they were trained
These youths were selected under the mission bravery and they have made the whole country proud by winning the Verest according to the name.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur school, to my young friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to defeat Verest from Nepal
Many congratulations to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Verest became the pair of the first Indian father-daughter
Not only that only young people are climbing Verest
Sangeeta Behel climbed Verest on 19th May and Sangeeta Behel is more than 50 years of age .
This work is commendable as well as reflects their commitment towards cleanliness, environment.
For years people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these brave brave men, especially to the daughters of the people.
A large number of people from every field will come forward in its support
When I talk about it India, I believe that as much as we will play, the same country will play
On social media people are sharing videos of the fitness challenge, they are challenging each other by tagging each other.
Many times in the matter of Mann Ki Baat, you have heard from me some things about sportspersons, and the last time our heroes of the Commonwealth Games, our minds were telling us through this programme - Namaskar Sir
Image Yadav, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that used to be part of the lives of every child, they are becoming less today.
These games were particularly part of summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that in different places they were known by different names, as now Pittu is known by many names.
Nobody knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven Stones, Dikori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional sports
There are also out doors, indoor too.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports .
The same game is known by different names, different names
I am from Gujarat I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
It is played with the seeds or dice of kernels or tamarind and 88 with the square board
This game was played in almost every state
We used to play these games .
Who will be one of us, who has not played guilli-danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game to play from village to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibila or Karabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibari and in Maharashtra it is called Financial
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children who are embarrassed but they become very tricky while playing
When they play from children to grandfather, grandfather and grandfather, then what they say, they also become untouchable.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions.
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
By crowd sourceing we can make a very big achievement of our traditional sports
Videos of these games can be created, in which the rules of sports can be shown, the methods of playing
Our country will officially host the World Environment Day celebrations on June 5
It is a very important achievement for India and is also acknowledging the growing leadership of India in the world towards reducing climate change.
This time theme is Beat Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you, understanding the spirit of this theme and its importance, all of us should ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impression of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and on our health.
Go to World Environment Day's Website Wed-India 2018 and there are many suggestions given very interestingly - see, learn and try to bring them into your daily life
In the last few weeks, all of us have seen that in different areas of the country there was dust and dust, heavy rains along with strong winds, which is unseasonal
There was also loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live with harmony with nature and live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated this for every step throughout his life.
When India played a key role in the OP21 and the Paris Agreement when we united the whole world through the International Solar Alliance, all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what we can do to make our plans clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember equally on June 21, not only you, we remember the whole world on June 21
June 21 is celebrated for the entire world as International Yoga Day and it has been all-accepted and people start preparations months ago.
These days news is being received, all the world is preparing to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21.
It was said centuries ago that it means that on doing regular yoga, some good qualities become like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like father .
Sorry feeling arises as mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, truth becomes our children, our sister, our brother, our self restraint, our bed and knowledge becomes our hunger eraser.
When all such qualities become someone ' s companions , the yogi wins all kinds of fear .
Once again, I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their legacy of Yoga and build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today is the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji
I salute Pandit ji
The memory of this month of May is also linked to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
In 1857 it was the month of May, when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers stood up in protest against injustice showing their bravery
It is sad that for a long time we have called the incidents of 1857 only revolt or soldier revolt .
In fact the incident was not only measured but also an attempt to push our self-respect .
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the month in which the first freedom struggle began.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was full of features
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been made by our beloved Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar takes both poetry and revolution together
Besides being a sensitive poet, he was adventurous revolutionary
I was watching a story on TV from our poor daughters of Sikar's raw settlements in Rajasthan
Our daughters, who were forced to wear garbage to ask for households - today they are learning the work of sewing and clothing to cover the poor.
The daughters here are sewing from normal to good clothes in addition to their clothes and their families today.
They are also doing courses for skill development along with this.
Our daughters have become self-reliant today, living their lives with respect and have become a force for their families.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters, full of hope and faith, for their bright future.
He has shown that if you are committed to showing something and you are committed to it, then success can be achieved in all the difficulties and this is not just Sikar but in every corner of India you will get to see all this
If you look around you, you will come to mind how people overcome the problems
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy the tea there, some people also have discussions and discussions.
These discussions are also political, social, films are also there, sports and sportspersons are also there on the problems of the country that there is such a problem that it should be solved - but often these things are limited to discussion but some people who move forward in the direction of bringing about changes with their work, their hard work and passion.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack City of Orissa, has a similar story to make others dreams and fulfil themselves.
Yesterday I was fortunate to meet D. Prakash Rao.
Shri D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
They provide full education, health and food to all the children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and giving a new direction to the lives of those poor children in 1997. 1997
They have ended the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
Let us push forward positiveness
In the month of June there is so much heat that people wait for rain and in this hope they look at clouds in the sky .
A few days later people will also wait for the moon
The view of the moon means that Eid can be celebrated
After one month of fasting during Ramzan the festival of Eid symbolizes the beginning of celebration .
I am confident that everybody will celebrate Eid with full enthusiasm, on this occasion, children will get specially good Edie.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bond of harmony in our society .
My best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, I thank you all.
Then you will meet in the matter of mind next month
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
And I am very happy that many people have written to me showing their support for this, letters have been sent to me, their Witness Mantra at India stories have also been shared on social media. A gentleman Shriman Shashikant Bhosle has written sharing a picture of the swimming pool - My weapon is my body, my delement is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes, I feel myself happy and healthy with the morning walk and she further says - or me fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make these vacations an opportunity for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that future wars on water in the world are going to take place , everyone speaks , but is it our responsibility
Do we not think water conservation should be a social responsibility
That is, the responsibility of the person who has knowledge is that I do not know Bengali language, but when I was young, I had a habit of getting up very early - from childhood and radio starts early in eastern India, starts late in West India, then I have an idea of fatness in the morning.
Rabindra Music started at 30 o'clock, Rabindra Music was started on radio and I didn't know the language. I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on radio early morning. And when Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmoni got the opportunity to listen to these poems, you too got a lot of consciousness. You must have been influenced by Rabindra Music and his poems. I pay homage to Rabindra Nath Thakur.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian. We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who guided millions of people around the world who showed the power of compassion, service and sacrifice. This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the responsibility of trying, resolution and walking on his path while remembering Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha is the inspirational power of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood. This is the human value that is the highest in todays world.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been inspired in his social philosophy. He said that my social philosophy may be said to be included in three words
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami .

We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
On January 26, when all the dignitaries from ASEAN (ASEAN) countries were here, they came with them with a cultural team and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting the Ramayana to us.
That is, Ram and Ramayana, not only in India but also in the ASAN countries in this territory of the world, are still creating the same inspiration and influence.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ramnavmi.
My dear countrymen, like every time I have received all the letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities.
Komal Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting Sanskrit on-line courses
Besides being a professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made on this side .
I would also request the listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit to consider how the suggestion of Komal ji should be carried forward
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar - Read Comments written on your Narendra ModiApp
The concern you have expressed on the decreasing water level in the ground is definitely very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in summer
Shakal ji, I have brought your feelings to all the audiences.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I will talk to the youth about their health.
They think that comparison to Asian countries is our young physician week
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I will talk to everyone about health in detail.
The President of France had visited Kashi in the past, Mr. Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that visit were about to touch the mind, were about to create effects.
And, he had urged them to propagate on all photographs, all video, social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India shared that photo on the same day on social media and Narendra ModiApp
Anga, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that these letters touch my fatigue throughout the day.
So many letters, so many phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, whatever I have heard and there are many things that have touched my mind - even if I talk about them, I will have to say something continuously for months.
This time most of the letters are from children who have written about Ceam
The holidays have shared their plans,
Worried about the water of animals and birds in summer
Farmer brothers and sisters have received letters about the activities of farmers and fairs and farming that are going on all over the country.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions regarding water conservation
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions come in the festival season.
That is, things of mind change with weather and perhaps it is also true that our mind changes the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the weather of the whole country .
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment on time, Saidul Laskar's sister died - she decided to build a hospital so that no poor dies due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold home ornaments in this mission, collected money through donation
In this way, after 12 years of collection of rupees, the Bhagirath efforts made by the last Sadul Laskar brought the color and today due to his hard work, due to his determination, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Many such inspirations introduce my country
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class and in every class, it is a belief that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
A positive atmosphere of self-confidence filled with hope
This self-confidence, this positivity, this will realize our resolution of New India, will prove the dream.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devilal ji - everyone considers agriculture and farmers as an important part of the country's economy and common life.
Mahatma Gandhi's attachment to soil, fields and farmers, this feeling reflects in this line when he said - To forget how to dig the health and to end the soil, it is to forget courses. That is, if we forget to dig the earth and take care of the soil then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji often emphasized the need for trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of a massive public awareness to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities for our farmers and enhance food and milk production.
This state with low area has done a great job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved record production over the last five years during 2015-16.
He has shown that when the goal is set, the courage is high and the will is in the mind then it can be proved and shown.
In the letter that I have received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide fair prices to the farmers.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the village, the local markets and the global markets.
Farmers do not have to go too far to sell their produce - for this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be upgraded with infrastructure and integrated with APM and e-NAM platform
In a way, connectivity is being created with any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our resolution, how can one hundred and fifty crore Indians pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by mixing shoulder to shoulder
You are my request, you share your views on this through MyGov with everyone.
What is Gandhi's 150 logo
What is slogan or mantra or ghosh-speak
Give your suggestions about this
Together we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire them to bring our country to new heights.
Tell us something on how the institutions are mobilising. Thank you, you have said right and I believe that both Swachh Bharat and healthy India are complementary to each other.
Today, the country has moved ahead of the conventional approach in the field of health.
At the same time, every work related to health in the country was done only by the Health Ministry, now all the departments and Ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Sanitation, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the State Governments are working together for a healthy India and the emphasis is being laid on health as well as affordable health.
Preventive healthcare is also the cheapest and the easiest
And we will benefit the person, the family and the society as much as we are aware of the preventive healthcare.
Life is healthy is the first necessity - sanitation
As a preventive healthcare, Yoga has renewed its identity worldwide.
Yoga guarantees both itness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today, has reached home and home.
This time International Yoga Day 21st June - there are less than 100 days left
On the last three International Yoga Days, people participated with great enthusiasm everywhere in the country and the world.
This time also we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and motivate the entire family, friends, all for Yoga.
My dear countrymen, I am not Yoga Teacher
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asanas, pranayama together.
Healthcare accessible and affordable , people are affordable and accessible - efforts are being made at a comprehensive level for this .
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being made available at low cost.
More new centers are being opened
I appeal to the audience of Mann Ki Baat to provide information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy - their cost of many medicines will be reduced
They will have a great service .
The price of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The goal of making the country TB free by 2025
This is a very big task
You need help in delivering awareness to the people
To get rid of TB, we all have to make collective efforts.
My dear countrymen, 14th April is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
Years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had spoken of India's industrialization.
The industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a big spot in the global economy and today the largest foreign direct investment in the world.
The whole world sees India as B for Investment Innovation and Development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible in the cities due to which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar trusted the urbanization and urbanization of India.
Keeping this vision forward, today a smart city mission and urban mission has been launched in the country so that every kind of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country can be provided with good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance
They didn ' t want any person to live his life in poverty
At the same time they believed that by giving only a share in the poor, their poverty could not be removed.
India, Stand Up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s when only the roads and railways were talked about in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw water-power as nation-power
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built at different coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40's, most of the discussions were about 2nd World War, Emerging Old-ar and Partition at that time, Dr. Ambedkar in a way called Team II.
had laid the foundation of the spirit of India
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and beyond that in every aspect of governance, the competitive cooperative federalism and the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me associated with the backward classes.
He has shown us that to move forward, it is not necessary to be born only in a larger or a rich family, but people born in poor families in India can also dream, try to fulfil those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar
India which belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor, belongs to the backward
Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr.
Under this, there will be separate programs on village development, poor welfare and social justice throughout India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days many festivals are going to come to Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is the day of remembering his sacrifice and penance .
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence will inspire all of us
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of Easter comes, Lord Christ remembers the inspirational teachings of Christ who have always given the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion to humanity.
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, then on the same day, the joy and joy of Poila Vaisak in Bihar, the joy and joy will be shadowed in Assam.
All these festivals are attached to our fields and food grains in some form, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts that we get as produce.
Once again all the best wishes to you all
Initially , the talk of mind starts from a phone call .
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever imagined that the river, the sea, why the water becomes colorful
This question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India
When we talk about science, the name of Bharat-Ratna Sir C.V. Raman comes to us first.
One of his treasures is known as Raman Defect .
We celebrate the National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had treasured the incident of light scattering for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan , Bhaskar , Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta , on the other hand Sushrut and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the name of Hamous Particle Boson was also named
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence smart with self learning
Can any help the farmers regarding crop yield
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got the opportunity to visit Gujarat, Ahmedabad for the inauguration of IDREATE.
Science and Technology are value neutral
Prices in them, don't happen automatically
Any machine will do the same as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison, who invented the High Bulb, failed many times in his experiments
Once he was asked about this, he replied, I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making high bulbs, i.e. Dison made his failures his own power.
Incidentally, I am in Auroville, the Karmabhoomi of Maharshi Arabindo today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life
Answer searched and guided humanity
To know the truth, the feeling of repeatedly asking questions is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific treasure .
Do not sit comfortably until the answer to questions like what and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate all our scientists, all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of crisis, Safety, Disaster, I have a lot of messages on all these subjects, people keep writing to me something or the other.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has spoken on Occupational Safety in his comment on Narendra Modi Mobile App
He has written that safety standards on factories and construction sites in our country are not as good
If India's National Security Day is on March 4, then the Prime Minister should talk about safety in his Mann Ki Baat program so that awareness among the people about safety increases
If we are not aware of safety in daily life, we are unable to get it, then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read the boards written on the roads many times, it writes in it - vigilance decreased, loss, smile and smile, do not leave the world so soon, do not connect with security - Do not do any fun, otherwise life will be cheaper, that sentence is never used in our life.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can only protect our lives, but we can save society from very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that there are many formulas written about safety on the workplace but when we see, it does not seem to be followed anywhere
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate
This country has faced many natural and human-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents
Disaster Friendship initiative has also been taken to train volunteers in floods, cyclone risk districts.
Training and awareness play a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year with Lu Heat Wave
Subsequently, NMA organized workshops for management of Heat Waves, launched campaign to create awareness among the people
A good result came out from everyone's participation
The number of deaths due to Lu in 2017 decreased unexpectedly to around 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
There are innumerable people working in the society, social organizations, aware citizens - I would like to appreciate all those who are engaged in relief and rescue operations within minutes wherever there is a disaster.
And the number of such an anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscience society
In our culture, we often talk about values, safety of values, but we have to understand the values of safety and security.
We have to make it a part of our life .
I mean , what was the arrangement of giving information
Why
Because we are not conscious of nature and that is why we listen to our ears and airplanes after sitting but this information is for me.
We have the same experience in every field of life
We should not imagine that safety is for someone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the feeling of security of the society is also included.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis was laid on making waste to wealth and waste to energy through biogas for the villages under Swachh Bharat.
The initiative was initiated for this and it was named GBAR-Han-Galwaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-HAN scheme is to clean the villages and to convert the solid waste curtains of animal dung and fields into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use animal dung and other biological waste to produce energy but its full potential was not being used in India .
We are now moving forward in this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural
The goal of using cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste, all these have been set to make biogas based energy.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy matters for cooking and lighting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New job opportunities for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform for smooth system of Gobar Dhan Yojana will also be created which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by creating a self-help group.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement of clean energy and green jobs to transform waste into wealth in your village and make dung from dung to dung .
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard about the festivals of music, food festival and film festivals.
But in a unique effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first waste festival of the state was organized
The objective behind this festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness and creative use of waste in the city and to create awareness about various ways to reuse the carbag.
During this festival, various activities took place, from students to adults, everyone joined
Different types of artworks were made using waste
Workshops organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management
Inspired by Raipur, different types of waste festivals took place in other districts
Innovative ideas, shared discussions, poems and poems were read by everyone taking initiatives on their own.
A festive atmosphere was ready for cleanliness
The way schoolchildren participated in a big way, it was amazing
I congratulate the Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March every year
There are many programs in the country and the world .
On this day, women are also honored with the Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country who have done exemplary work in different areas in the past
On this occasion I remember the promises of Swami Vivekananda
He had said that the idea of idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - a hundred and a half years ago this idea of Swamiji expresses the thinking of women power in Indian culture.
It is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life. It is our responsibility to all of us.
We are part of that tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
They have advanced themselves , and have taken the country and society forward and taken them to a new stage .
In the past, a very good suggestion was given to me by a great poet
He suggested that on March 8, there are programs like celebrating Women's Day, whether in every village and city, who have completed 100 years
Can a program of respect for such mothers and sisters be organised and can they talk about a long life
Under this campaign launched on 26th January, 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big is the event
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, which will transform the cleanliness campaign in normal life, the rites of sanitation effectively into the nature of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm is there among the people there
You all know well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from the sea from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being with Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephanta for so many years of independence.
The dark shadow in the lives of the people of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sendbandar, three villages of Elephanta Islands for 70 years is now dark and their life has illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there
I am happy that the villages of Elephanta and Elephanta will now be illuminated with electricity.
This is not just a power, but a new beginning of development.
What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness that brings the lives of the countrymen to illuminate their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, we have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March is the beauty of the fig trees decorated with floating crops, the golden ears of the peacocked wheat and the glowing mango mangoes - this is the speciality of this month .
But this month is very dear to all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi with joy
Holi is as important as the colors of Holi because this day is the day of burning evils in the fire .
Holi is an auspicious opportunity to sit together by forgetting all the minds and minds, to become a participant in each other's pleasure and gives a message of love unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen on the festival of Holi.
This festival remains full of colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, Thank you very much, greetings
My dear countrymen, today I have written a long letter to Shri Prakash Tripathi on Narendra ModiApp and urged me to touch the topics written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla's death date to go to space on February 1,
He left us in the Columbia spacecraft but inspired millions of youth all over the world
I am grateful to brother Prakash ji that he has started in his long letter from the farewell of Kalpana Chawla .
It is a matter of sadness for all that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls of India, especially in the whole world, that there is no limit for women-power.
Nothing is impossible if there is a desire and determination, if there is a desire to do something
It is very happy to see that today women in India are moving faster in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has been amazing the whole world.
Indian dictators have a long tradition
Many of India's scholars have contributed to the fabrication of Vedas' Chats
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi do not know how many names
This shows the importance of women in our society .
And then, in our society, women have been given power status
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the formula of unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many more examples
He has written that our bold defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft Sukhoi will fly in 30, inspire them
Three brave women have become emotional Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Higher Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30.
All Women Rue, led by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to San Francisco in the United States and back to Delhi.
Flying in India Boeing Jet - and all women
In the past, Honble President initiated a new initiative
President of India meets a group of extraordinary women who first performed something in their respective areas
These women achievements, first female merchant navies, first female train driver of passenger train, first woman fire hitter, first woman bus driver, first woman to reach Antarctica, first woman to reach Everest, in this way, first addees in every field - our women-powers have achieved extraordinary achievements breaking the conservation of society and established a record.
He showed that a new path can be developed by crossing all obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, passion and determination.
A book has also been prepared on these women achievements, first standards so that the whole country can take inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their works.
It is also available on Narendra Modi website as e-book
Today, the country's women-power plays an important role in the positive change in the country and society.
Today when we are discussing women empowerment I would like to mention a railway station .
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be thinking what is connectivity between this
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where all women employees are
Woman State in all departments - be it Commercial Partment, Railway Policy, Ticket Checking, Announcing, Point Person, the status of more than 40 women.
This time, after seeing the Republic Day parade, many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social media that there was a main point in the parade, BSF Biker Contingent in which all the women were participating.
They were experimenting courageously and this scene was also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women-power is leading
becoming self-reliant
When the reference of tribal women comes to everyone's mind, a certain picture emerges in which there is a jungle, there are pedestrians, the burden of wood on them is raised on the head of women
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power have made a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is Maoist-affected area
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this
Tribal women in such a dangerous area are becoming self-reliant by running rickshaw
In a very short period many women have joined it .
I appreciate the district administration here, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave what is out of time, accepting the reform of what is necessary
Any life-social is identified by his self-reecting mechanism
In our country for centuries , there has been constant efforts at the individual and social levels against social evils and evils .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
To eradicate social evils from roots in the state, the world's longest human chain, human hain has been created
Through this campaign, people were made aware of evils like child marriage and dowry.
The whole state resolved to fight with evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters were all involved in this war.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, the human chain went uninterrupted to the boundaries of the state
For all the people of the society to get the benefits of development in true sense, it is important that our society is free from these evils.
Let us all take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and make a New India.
Create India, a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration and every person involved in the human chain that they have taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines was Rs. 6,000 per month on the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the earlier Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire that I should talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat program so that more and more people can get the information and take advantage of it .
For the past some time many people used to write me about this subject, tell me
gets a deep satisfaction
And I also felt very good that Shriman Darshan ji had the idea that he got what he had got.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care affordable and encourage Ease of Living
Medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper than 50 to 90 from branded medicines sold in the market .
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens taking medicines every day, and saves them a lot.
Generic medicines purchased in it are according to the fixed standard of the World Health Organization .
This is the reason that good quality medicines are found at cheap prices
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This is not only providing cheaper medicines but also creating new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and AMRUT stores of hospitals
The only purpose behind all this is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has taken a photo, share on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The photograph was such that my attention was drawn to that photo
The photo was such that a grandson was taking part in the Clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morana river used to flow for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, watershed
A lot of waste was being thrown on the river and its edge .
A action plan was prepared and on January 13, one day before Makar-Sankranti, under the first phase of Mission Lean Morna, four kilometres area was cleaned on both coasts of Morna River at fourteen locations.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly and mothers and sisters participated in this excellent work of Mission Lean Morna.
On 20th January, 2018, this Swachhta Abhiyan was continued in the same way and I am told that unless the Morana river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something , nothing is impossible .
Large changes can be brought through mass movement
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the city corporation for making this work a mass movement and your efforts will also inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma awards these days.
Even in the newspapers, it attracts attention on T.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma awards but in the last three years its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come from the entire process being online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become complete transformation.
Padma Awards have been given to those who usually do not appear in big cities, in newspapers, in TV, in the function.
Now the person is not identified for the award, the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard that Shri Aurobindo Gupta ji, you will be happy to know that I would like to commemorate this thing.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his entire life in making toys for children
They have been making toys from waste for four decades to increase curiosity for science in children
They are trying to inspire children from useless things to scientific experiments, for this they are inspiring children by visiting three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages.
What a wonderful life, what a wonderful dedication
A similar story is Sitava Jodti (SIV) of Karnataka
They have not been called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades , he has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi .
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven but then put his whole life for the welfare of Devdasis .
Not only this, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
They used to do normal jobs for living but they were fond of making traditional tribal paintings
Today due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who illuminated India ' s name abroad, was recognized and awarded the Padma Shri award
You will be filled with pleasant surprise by listening to the story of Tribal Women Laxmikutty of Kerala
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in tribal areas between dense forests
They have made five hundred herbal medicines based on their memory .
They are mastered in making medicines used after snake bites
Lakshmiji is constantly serving the society with herbal medicines .
He was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to the society by identifying this anonymous person .
I wish to mention another name today, 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also selected for the award
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in other houses to make hospitals
When he was 23 years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to make a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hard work hospital.
I am confident that there are many male and female rituals in our Bahuratna-Vasundara, whom no one knows or no one knows.
The Padma Award is a medium for the society but I would also tell the countrymen that those who live for the society around us, those who live for the society, those who live for the society, those who work for some or the other characteristics, those who have worked for the entire life.
They don't work for honor, but due to their work we get inspiration.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should call and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some effort in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas
This is January 9, when revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from STARI AC
On this day we celebrate unbreakable bonds between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we had organized a programme where all the Indian-Mool MPs living around the world invited the Mayors (MARS)
You will be happy to know that in that programme from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Jiji, Tanania, Kenya, Hanada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, and from many other countries where our mayor is original Indian, wherever the MP is original, they all participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as they have maintained their strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union have sent me a calendar in which they have demonstrated their contributions in various fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
If someone is working in TD, then someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, someone brings the mind of the society with his music, then someone from his poems
If someone is researching on climate change then someone is working on Indian texts, someone has set up a gurudwara by driving a truck then someone has built a mosque
I would like to thank you for this remarkable work of the European Union, for recognising the people of Indian origin and providing information to people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path
On that day we celebrate the martyrdom day that day we pay homage to the great martyrs who lost their lives in the defense of the country at 11 o'clock
The path of peace and non-violence, this is Bapu's path
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or a society-worthy Bapu, the ideals that revered Bapu has told us are still very relevant.
They were not just core theory
At present, we look at Dagar-Dagar how right Bapu's words were
If we resolve that we should walk on the path of Bapu - what can be a greater reverence than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age should meet and churn on New India, find ways and plans
How shall we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that our freedom fighters had dreamt of
B.
A.
I talked to them, there was no name of disappointment, enthusiasm, energy, dreams, resolutions, the time I spent, I got inspiration from those daughters and these are the strengths of the country. These are my young people, these are the future of my country, my dear countrymen, not only of our country, whenever there is a discussion about the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala. It is very natural that every year millions of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami.
And especially at the place that is located between the hills and the forests, how can this problem be converted into a ritual, how can it be found out the way to overcome the problem and what is so much strength in public participation - this is in itself the Sabarimala temple is an example of P.
Who will have made such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect him, who does not respect him.
They are very bigger than all of us at age, and they are witnesses to the different stages of the country.
They're going to be 90 years old on 28th September
Before leaving abroad, I was fortunate to talk to Didi on phone.
This conversation was the same, as in a very rare, the younger brother speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pramanam
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I thought, Hilata ji: Yeah Hamodi ji: Many best wishes to you birthday, give advance greetings
Lata ji: There are many people bigger than age, but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their work.
Lata ji: Yes, I think that my parents have the blessings and the blessings of those who listen.
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is your humility, this is a great education for all of us of the new generation, this is a big inspiration for us that even after learning everything in your life, your parents' rites and humility have always given priority to that humility.
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you: Ji Modi ji: You fed me some or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: What are you, you don't know
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival and that is what I am very happy.
Looks very good
Modi ji: Just keep your blessings, keep your blessings on the whole country, and, people like us, keep doing something good, you have always inspired me.
I also get your letter and if I get some of your gifts and gifts, then I have a special joy for this kind of personality, which is one family relationship.
Lata ji: ji, ji
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because, I'm seeing, I know, how much business you are and how much work you do
What do you have to think
When you came to touch your mother's feet, I also sent someone to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And he blessed me on the telephone, so I felt very good, Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love
And once again I convey my best wishes to you on your birthday
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, it would have thought that Rubru would come: ji, ji
Lata ji: Yes, sure, sure
This will be my fortune .
Modi ji: Pranam, Sister
Lata ji: Prayam
Modi ji: Many best wishes to you: very much salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Festivals will remain bright for several weeks, across the country.
All the best wishes to all of you, to the upcoming festivals
Festivals, all family members will come together
Perhaps, this proverb is not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, a motivation for people.
Think, on one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of him, in the houses of some people around him, there is dark shadow.
In some households, sweets are getting worse, in some households, children craving for sweets
The real joy of these festivals is only when this dark sixth, this darkness is less - Ujiyala spreads
We shared happiness there too, where there is a lack, and this is our nature too.
Think about the sweets, sweets, clothing, gits, when delivery in our homes.
At least in our households, which we don't work in large numbers, we must take out delivery of such things.
In many cities, many NGOs, start-ups of young friends do this work.
They collect clothes, sweets, food, everything from the houses of the people, searching for the needy and bringing them to anonymous activity.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate darkness under this lamp
The smile on the faces of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals, your face will shine and shine, give you and become illuminated, your Diwali will become illuminated and illuminated
My dear brothers and sisters, in Deepawali, as a privilege and prosperity, Lakshmi's household arrives.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi because, daughter brings luck and prosperity.
Can we honour this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters around us, many multiple people who are doing extraordinary work.
Somebody will be working to teach poor children, somebody will be engaged in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, then someone will be serving society by becoming a doctor, engineer
By becoming a lawyer, you must try to get justice to someone
Our society should identify, respect, and proud of such daughters.
Their respect programs are in the country
One more thing, you can do about the achievements of these daughters, share more and more in social media, and use Bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
Like we all launched a great campaign, Selee with Daughter and it spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we run the campaign Lakshmi of India
Incentive of Indias Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen
My dear countrymen, I had said about Mann Ki Baat earlier that it is a great benefit that I get the privilege of interacting with many unknown people directly.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal sent me a big interesting letter to Alina Tayang.
And it is written in it, I read the letter in front of you. Honorable Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my Ceam's results came, some people asked me if you read the Cam Warriors book
I told that, I have not read this book
But, go back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After that my experience was very good
I thought, if I had read this book before Weam, I would have had a lot of benefit.
I like many aspects of this book very well, but I also saw that there is a lot of mantra for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing a letter
Ham Warriors to read 2-3 times, thanks
What you have said that if I can get out at the time of new edition then I will definitely try to write some things for Parents, Teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to tell me your experiences and suggest your suggestions about the aspects related to stress free team.
I ' ll definitely study him
I will think of it and I will try to write it in my own words, in my own way, and if your suggestions come more, then my new edition will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and TV.
But, you know, I'm a common man like you too
If someone else was on this occasion, he would have become sad and disappointed, but, his face did not smile, but he brought smile on everyone's faces with his words.
The form of sportsman spirit found in his humility, simplicity and truth senses was convinced.
The audience present there welcomed his words warmly
Even after losing in a tough collision, he praised his rival Nadal and gave the living evidence of sportsman spirit
However, on the other hand, Champion Nadal also lauded Daniel's game with great appreciation
The zeal of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner was both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is really worthy of grandfathers
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janayti Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person gets qualification and humility together, then whose heart can not win
Indeed, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk now, I am doing straight for your good.
It ' s very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we get awakened at the beginning, then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel like, today, especially with my youngsters, I must talk about something.
We all know that tobacco intoxication is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to leave its addiction.
The risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure increases very much to those who consume tobacco
Everyone says this
Tobacco intoxication occurs due to nicotine present in it .
In adolescence its consumption also affects the development of the brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you, on a new subject
You will know, recently there is a ban on e-cigarette in India.
Different from normal cigarette e-cigarette is a type of electronic device .
While we all understand the threats of normal cigarette well, there has been a misconception about e-cigarette.
There is no threat to e-cigarette
It is their endeavor that no member of the family should smoke, do not smoke
They know that smoking, tobacco causes heavy damage to the body
The drinker also knows and the seeer also knows .
But the case of e-cigarette is very different
There is no such awareness among people about e-cigarette
They are completely unaware of its danger and that is why sometimes e-cigarette enters home in curiosity quietly
Our young money walks on the path of waste, unknowingly walks
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it only with smell.
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are roaming around in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes in their hands with great pride as an unknown and sometimes as an Asian Statement and they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
E-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of intoxication does not destroy our young country.
Do not ruin the dreams of every family, the lives of children should not be wasted
This disease, this habit should not be rooted in the society
I urge you all to leave tobacco dishes and do not follow any wrong confusion about e-cigarette
Let us all together build a healthy India
You have it I
Do you remember India
India means a little bit that if we go to Gym for two hours morning and evening, then it will happen.
This is our mother of India, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara
Many human jewels have come out of this earth
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people, has been the workplace.
And these are the people who have consumed themselves, not for themselves, for others,
Likewise, a great Vibhuti is being honored in Vatican City on October 13
It is a matter of pride for every Indian, that Pope will declare Mary Threasia a saint on October 13, coming to France
The work done by Sister Mary Threasia for the betterment of humanity in his younger life of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to social service and education.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and remained in this mission for life.
I once again pay homage to Sister Mary Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but also for the entire world that today, when we are celebrating 150 Gandhis, along with this, 130 crore Indians have resolved to get rid of single-se plastic.
Seeing the kind of leadership that India has taken in the entire world in the direction of environmental protection, the vision of all the countries remains towards India today.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the campaign to get rid of single se plastic on 2nd October.
Everywhere people are contributing to this campaign in their own way.
But, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
I noticed his work, so I talked to him on the phone and tried to understand his new experiment.
Maybe these things will help the people and the people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a unique effort they plogging
When I heard the plogging word for the first time I was also new to me
in foreign countries , perhaps these words have been used in some quantity .
But, in India, Repudaman Belvi ji has propagated it a lot.
Let ' s talk to them
I congratulate you all and friends, this time, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports has also taken up its initiative.
On 2nd October, 2 km plogging, these programmes are scheduled across the country.
We have heard how to do this programme, what happens in the programme with the experience of Repudaman ji.
With this we will not only take care of our health but also protect the health of the mother of the earth .
This campaign is increasing awareness among the people about hygiene as well as cleanliness.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction, then India will move 130 crore steps towards getting rid of single use plastic.
Repudaman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team, and for this new imagination.
want to move forward to convert their lives to the country's interest
One thing desires to remember in advancing
Well, I will surely tell him in detail in the next mind but today I am saying in a slight advance so that you get an opportunity to prepare.
You remember, October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
So you just start preparing
In detail, I will surely do the same thing, but now it is time, some people can start practices, some schemes can also be made.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and that too, make a program to stay for one night, two nights.
You see, understand, experience India
How many diversities we have
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on holidays, people go and therefore I will again urge you to visit any such 15 places in India.
Today, our rank is thirty-four and five years ago, our rank was at number 65, that is, in a way we have put a big jump.
If we try further, 75 years of independence, we will make our place in tourism in the major places of the world.
It must also be seen that in the days of Diwali, there will be arson from firecrackers etc., there will be no loss of any person.
Whatever precaution should be taken for this, you must take precautions.
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they would have worked to build the Constitution of their country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal region, where the sea had an important role, many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either situated on the coastal coasts or were surrounded by seas, the responsibility of the security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha navy to conclude large vessels and small boats in Maratha Navy. His naval personnel were very capable of attacking and defending any enemy and discussing Maratha Navy and remember Kanhoji English.
There is no fear of thinking, there will be no soil, no trees will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will the organism be possible
With all kinds of scientific methods, it has been proved that the soil and mother causes serious damage due to the use of urea more than required. The farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the soil and mother sick
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil and the children of our soil resolve to revive the relationship of this mother-son once again, whether today they use the amount of urea in their fields, 2022, when they will be 75 years of independence, will they stop using half the use
The person of North-India will not know what is in South-India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
If we look at Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekanand Ji, our former President Abdul Kalam ji in his speech, then it comes to him that when he visited India, he got a new inspiration to see India and live for it and all these great men travelled to India in the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India in his own way. Can we try to live in India by ourselves, to different states of our country, to different societies, to groups, to their traditions, to learn their traditions, to learn their categories and beliefs as a student
Can you keep on Incredible India
You see, all the people of a state will tell me that I will tell the government that they should scrutinize it and how to promote the tourist destination in a way by the intentions of the people.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who gave life to the unity of the country.
Our ancestors have acknowledged public life and values, non-violence and Samadhar for centuries.
Ahimsa Parmo Dharma: This is what we have heard since childhood, have come to say
I would like to assure the countrymen that the law takers, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, they will never tolerate the country nor will any government tolerate it
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, living and dressing.
We see diversity in every behavior of life .
Even our festivals are full of diversity and see cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events because of our cultural heritage of thousands of years old, there will hardly be a day in 365 days when no festival is connected to us.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals follow the leaflet at the time of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals , so first of all I would like to say to you , Mitchami Dukkadam .
The festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society yesterday .
Parishan festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain society .
On the last day of Parishana festival is the day of Sanvatsari .
This is really a wonderful tradition in itself
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called a forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michchami Dukkadam .
Anyway , in our scriptures there is a forgiveness of Veerasya Bhushanam i .e . forgiveness of the heroes .
Forgiving is a hero .
We have come to hear these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare had written in his drama The Merchant of Science the importance of forgiveness, Mercy is two blest, It blessth him that gifts and him that takes i.e. forgiveness and whoever was forgiven, both of them get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi has got a humor in every corner of India and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural for the public to celebrate Ganesh festival.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before the last 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement.
And after independence they have become a symbol of social education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi goes on for 10 days .
This great festival is called the symbol of unity, equality and purity .
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganeshotsav
Onam is being celebrated in Kerala now
One of the colorful festivals of India, Onam is a major festival of Kerala
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival provides a message of love and harmony in the society as well as a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming the cause of attraction for tourism.
And I would tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or the Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way .
We and festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners
What can we do in that direction
A few days later in the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us, we also have to make festivals in New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals and sanitation are connected in family life .
Preparation of the festival means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to make a social nature .
Cleanliness should be an integral part of cleanliness in our country, not just in the house, in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, in our country.
My dear countrymen, the definition of being modern is changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought-processes are, a scale has also started working in knowing all these things and how much you are aware about environment.
Your activities have eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior that is against him.
In society , if it is against it , it is considered to be evil today .
And as a result of that, today I am seeing that in these days this festival is also eco-friendly Ganapati, as if a big campaign has emerged.
If you go to YouTube then you will see that children in every house are making Ganesh ji, they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various uses are being done in every family
See how big change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stimulating minds.
Three years ago, when Swachhata campaign started, it will be three years on October 2
And, its positive results are visible
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
Sufficient people lost their lives , but when the water decreased after the floods , the dirt failed everywhere .
At such a time, workers of Jamiat Ulemayind cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat in a phased manner.
He sweated himself, all people came out
Excellent example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemayind gave
Where can our country reach if it becomes our sustainable nature
My dear countrymen, I invite all of you that once again 15-20 days before the 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti, 15-20 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I used to say that water service is the same Lord Seva, a campaign for Swachhata Hi Seva.
Create an atmosphere for cleanliness across the country
Whenever we get the opportunity, we find the opportunity.
But we all join
Assume it as a preparation for Diwali in a way, consider it as a preparation for Navaratri, consider it as a preparation for Durga Puja
Friends of my social media can run some creative campaigns and inspire the virtual world to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition, this campaign by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which you have essay competition, competition for making small films, painting competition is being organized.
You can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, no age limit
You can make short films, make it from your mobile
Can make 2-3 minute films that inspire cleanliness
They can be in any language, they can also be silent.
You see how this will shine on 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti
You can imagine how a sacred joy will be within us to pay homage to revered Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after this 15-day hygiene campaign.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept loans of all of you in a particular way today.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the depth of the heart, not because I would like to express my gratitude to you for such a long time, because with this programme of Mann Ki Baat, lakhs of people are connected to every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores but millions of people sometimes write me letters, sometimes send messages, sometimes messages come to the phone, I have a big treasure for me.
This has become a big opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than you wait for the matter of mind .
I ' m greedy because I get something to learn from all of you
Yeah, you've ever made such a mistake.
Sometimes some things become part of our habit that we don't think we're wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking Aparna to Pune
I want to tell about one of my friends
He always trys to help people but I am surprised to see one of his habits
I went to the mall to shop with him once
On a sari, he spent two thousand rupees comfortably and Rs 450 on Piza, while the auto that took to go to the mall kept paying for five rupees for a long time from the automan
Returning back, buy vegetables on the way and save Rs 4-5 on every vegetable again.
I think very bad
You must tell you about this in your mind
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you must have been shocked, cautious and maybe you must have decided not to make such a mistake ahead.
Do you not think that when we come to sell some goods around our house, some ferry makers come to us, some small shopkeepers and those who sell vegetables, sometimes we have a relationship with the auto-rickshaw people, whenever we have a relationship with some hardworking person, we start selling it with it, we start selling it with it.
And if we go to eat food in a big restaurant then we don't even see what it is written in the bill, we don't pay money.
Not only this, you should go to shopping in a showroom, you do not have any value but if you come to your kinship with a poor, you do not live without value.
Have you ever thought of what happens to the poor mind
Two rupees and five rupees do not make any difference in your life but how deep does this small habit make his mind imagine
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling the phone that touches so much heart
I am confident that my countrymen will also be habituated to behave like this to the poor.
My dear young friends, On 29th August the whole country celebrates as National Sports Day
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable
I am reminded of the fact that I want the new generation of our country to play with sports.
Sports become part of our life
If we are a young country in the world then we should also see this young sports field
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancement, I understand what more is required
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart combination
The young generation of our country has come forward in the sports world and today in the age of computer, I would also like to warn that playing field is more important than play station.
Play A but outside the field also show you sometimes with the football
Crickets will play on the computer but in the open field the joy of playing cricket under the sky is something else .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out , the mother used to ask before when you would come back .
Today the condition has become that children either appear to see cartoon film in one corner when they come home or get stuck on the mobile game and then they have to shout and say when will you go out
It is a matter of happiness for our youngsters that India is going to organise IDA UNDER 17 World Cup from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from around the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from the world with the festival of sports, enjoy the game, create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about the game today, I want to share with the countrymen a very touching event that took place last week
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Will spend 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will spend in water
Our six daughters with courage among the waves of the sea and this is the first event in the world
Who will be Hindustanis who do not care about these daughters
I salute the zeal of these daughters and I have told them to share their experiences with the whole country
I will also make a separate arrangement for his experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read it because this is a courageous story, it will be a story of self-experience and I will be glad to deliver the words of these daughters to you
My best wishes to these daughters are very blessed.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day
Radhakrishnan ji is the birth anniversary of the former President of our country.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I salute them, the great scientist, Albert Einstein, had said.
T is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to wake joy in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important quality of a teacher to enjoy creative feelings and knowledge among his students.
This time when we celebrate Teachers ' Day , can we all make a resolution together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts, we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's take to transform this mantra
Honourable Prime Minister
My name is Doctor Annya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai City and work for India Research Centre of Howard University
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a matter of discussion about the Pandits of the economic world not only in India but also in the entire world.
On August 28, 2014, this campaign was launched by taking a dream in mind.
On August 28, the campaign of this Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana is taking three years.
30 crore new families have been connected with this, have opened bank accounts.
This is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a great solution that within three years, my poor brother, who is sitting at that end of the society, has become a part of the basic stream of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving money and he is feeling the security of money.
Sometimes they live in hand, they live in pockets, they are in the house, they want to spend the fruits.
If you have to do a good job in the coming days then money will work
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in banks by our poor
In a way this is the saving of the poor, this is his power in the coming days.
And the bank account opened with Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also benefitted from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana One Rupee, Thirty Rupees a small premium today creates a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, due to the insurance of one rupee, when a crisis over the poor man, the head of the family ended his life, he got Rs 2 lakh in a few days.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, dalits, tribals, women, youngsters who have been left out by reading and writing, those who intend to do something by standing on their feet, millions of youngsters have got no guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, banks and they have not only stood on their own feet, but also everybody has made a successful effort to provide employment to one-and-a-half two.
Today it is not so much time but I would definitely tell the people of the bank that they should upload it on MyGov.in, people will get inspiration from the fact that how a scheme brings transformation in the lives of a person, how it fills new energy, how it fills new confidence and hundreds of examples of it have come to me.
I will try my best to reach you and there is a motivation that people of the media can take full advantage of it.
They can also inspire new generation by interviewing such people
The mind of man is such that the rainy season is a big lure for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature all get enthusiastic on the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a vicious form, it shows how big it is to destroy the water.
Nature gives us life, keeps us alive, but sometimes the natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its gruesome nature, makes us very devastating.
The change in the changing weather cycle and the environment is also being negative.
For the past few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to excessive rains.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief works are being done at a broader level.
My colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching wherever possible.
State Governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens working with service are also making every effort to help people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, be it the soldiers of the army, be it the people of the Air Force, be it the NRC, be it the paramilitary forces, everybody at such a time gets connected to the serving disaster victims.
And 247 control room helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the situation of floods.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government system was prepared by mock drilling at maximum places before rains.
NCR teams were set up.
Gradually we also made the nature that according to the forecast of the weather, we can also create our activities, then we can avoid the loss.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time so many letters of GST have come, so many phone calls have come and people still express their happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax-GST started in our country on the date of this month.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after a month as the government had expressed
I would like to hear your views about it, thanks.
The GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very satisfied that when a poor person writes to me a letter, tells me how the prices of the need for a poor have decreased due to GST, how the things have become cheaper.
If a person living in the north-east, far-flung mountains and forests writes a letter that initially it was scared that what was not known but now when I started learning and understanding in it, I feel that it has become easier beforehand.
Trade became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' trust in business has started to grow.
Just now I was seeing how GST was affected on the transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How is time decreasing distance
highways are clutter free.
Pollution has also decreased due to the increase in the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This is the facility, but it also strengthens the economic pace.
Earlier, due to different tax structures, the maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector were engaged in maintaining the paperwork and they had to make new warehouses within every state.
GST, which I call Good and Simple Tax, indeed, has produced a very positive impact on our economy and in a very short time.
The speed at which there has been a small transition, the speed at which migration has been done, new registrations have been done, it has created a new confidence in the entire country.
And sometimes Pandits of the economy, Pandits of Management, Pandits of Technology, will surely write the use of GST in India as a model in front of the world.
There will be a case study for many universities in the world.
Because such a big change on such a large scale and implementing it in such a large country with the innovation of such crores of people, it is a great height of success in itself.
The world will definitely study it.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states have the responsibility.
All decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with unanimous consent.
And the result of that is that every government has the same priority that there is no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries associated with this work, to all the departments, to all the visitors of the central and state governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
In a way there is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again, I salute the people of Koti and Koti for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
We have easily heard this thing since childhood and this is the reason why the non-cooperation movement started on 1st August 1920.
The uit India Movement started on 9th August, 1942, which is known as the August Revolution and the country was free on 15th August, 1947.
In a way, in the month of August, many incidents are particularly linked to freedom.
But very few people know that uit India, this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people of the country who continued to be associated with the freedom struggle, struggled, confronted, the pages of history are inspired to build a grand India.
The heroes of our freedom have sacrificed, penance and sacrificed, what can be a big inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had determined the entire country to get rid of the British rule.
This was the time when the people of India had become part of the uit India movement in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, in every corner of the country, be it village or city or be it illiterate or be it illiterate or poor or be it rich or be it shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Public outbreak was at its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were swinging their lives in conflict with the mantra of Do or die.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, left the books.
The non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942 show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The forms of non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave a mantra to do or die.
There was public support, peoples capabilities, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all this success.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we see the pages of history slightly connected then Indias first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which started from 1857, continued every moment in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period has created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
People used to come, joined, went, new people came, newly joined, and the country continued to make every effort to overthrow the British rule.
This hard work from 1857 to 1942 created a situation that 1942 reached its peak and played such a bugle of uit India that within five years the British had to go away in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the people of freedom.
And from 1942 to 1947, it became a people's mind, as a five decisive years of determination to Siddhi, it became the reason for the independence of the country with success.
These were five years decisive.
Now I want to add you to this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's about 70 years.
Governments came and came.
Arrangements were made, changed, flourished, increased.
Everyone has tried in their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes were also found.
Aspirations also awakened.
Like 1942 to 1947, there was a decisive five years of Siddhi from the resolution.
I am seeing that from 2017 to 2022, a five-year section of Siddhi has come to us.
On 15th August, 2017, we celebrated as a resolution festival and when 75 years of independence in 2022, we will be transforming that resolution into realisation.
Crores and crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfil crores of resolutions.
So, as 1942 to 1947, five years have become decisive for the country's independence, they can become decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then we all have to take a strong resolution today.
2017 is the year of our resolution.
This is the month of August that we have to join with the resolution and we have to resolve.
Let us run a Mahabhiyan of Sankalp Se Siddhi from 9th August this month.
A resolution that we will prove in the next 5 years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to it as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Video, post, blog, articles, new ideas used by technology.
Convert this campaign to a mass movement.
This is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and familiarize the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe you must propagate it, spread it.
My dear countrymen, as the head servant of the country on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I'm just one person, he doesn't speak a person there.
The voice of hundred and fifty million Indians echoes from the Red Fort.
And I am happy that for the last three years, I get suggestions from every corner of the country on August 15, what should I say on August 15
This time also I invite you to send your views on MyGov either on Narendra ModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to reveal it in the time I have on 15th August.
I have received a complaint continuously in my speeches on 15th August that my speech becomes a little longer.
I have tried to make rules for me in 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know, I can't do that.
But I intend to try this time how I shorten my speech
Let's see, whether it does not get success.
I would like to do one more thing today, my countrymen.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never calculate it.
It is not that our festivals, our festivals, they are just an occasion of joy and pleasure.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And there is a natural joy in these festivals.
Festivals bring sweetness in relationships, affection in family, brotherhood in society.
Connect the person and society.
A comfortable journey from the person to the samshti runs.
Importantly becomes an opportunity to go towards Wayam.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhis in small domestic industries.
From Khadi to silk threads, do not know how many rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
Thousands of people who make Rakhi, who sell Rakhia, who sell sweets, join the festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, the family runs from this.
We burn lamps in Deepawali, it is not just a light festival, it is just a festival, it is a decoration of the house, it is not so.
He has a direct relationship with those poor families who make small soils.
But today, when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen that sometimes I think that even the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, consistently aware citizens of the environment have written letters to me.
And he has urged that you should tell about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi before time so that people can plan on the choice of Ganesh soil.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to say on this subject prematurely.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
125 years and 125 crore countrymen Lokmanya Tilak ji started the public Ganeshotsav for the unity of the society and for the awareness of the society, for the sacrament of collectivity.
Once again, let us compete essays in this year of Ganeshotsav, make discussion meetings, remember Lokmanya Tilak's contribution.
And this time I ' ve said very early .
I am confident that all of you will be associated with me and this will benefit the poor artisans, the poor artists, the artists who make idols, they will get employment, the poor will fill their stomach.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals that will come.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that our daughters are illuminating the name of the country, are attaining new heights, be it the field of education, be it economic sector or social sector or sports.
We are proud of our daughters and our countrymen.
Right now, our daughters performed a great performance in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I was very good to talk to them, but I was feeling that they could not win the World Cup, it was a big burden on them.
He also had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
Nowadays, the age of media is such that expectations are increased so much and when success is not achieved then it also changes into resentment.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India fail, then the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and speak such things and write such things, there is a great pain.
But for the first time that when our daughters could not succeed in the World Cup, hundred and fifty crore Indians took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only this, these daughters praised and glorified what they did.
I see a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you see this kind of privilege that you have only got this kind of privilege that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won hundred and fifty million countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again I remind you of the August Revolution, once again on 9th August, once again on 15th August, I remind you of the 75th year of independence.
Every countrymen should make a resolution, every countrymen should prepare a 5-year roadmap to prove the resolution.
We all have to take the country to new heights, to reach and to reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
The fate of the country, the future will be best, move forward with this belief.
Changing weather
This time the heat is also very much
But it is good that the rain is moving on its map on time .
In many parts of the country, Jhajjham rains have made the weather pleasant
After the rain, cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past
And all of us have seen that however difficult it is in life, however stress is there, personal life, public life, the arrival of rain also changes our mindset.
Today, Lord Jagannath ji's chariot yatra is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra takes place .
And the poor of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath ji
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor .
And very few people will know that there is a word in English, Juggernaut and that means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in the dictionary meaninging of this juggernaut it is also found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannath .
And therefore we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath ji's visit, I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country and salute Lord Jagannath ji in the sacred feet of Lord Jagannath ji.
India's diversity is also its specialty, India's diversity is also the power of India.
The holy month of Ramzan celebrated with a sacred spirit in far off places .
Now is the festival of Eid
My best wishes to all of you on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr
Ramzan month is a month of virtue donation, it is a month of sharing happiness and the more happiness they share, the more happiness they grow
Let us all share the treasures of happiness with inspiration from these sacred festivals, let us move the country forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, a big inspirational incident of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me
Around three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village. In a way more population belongs to brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together
And in this individual toilet the government also gets help and the amount of assistance was given to them about Rs 17 lakhs .
17 lakhs for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for this auspicious occasion of Ramzan for the welfare of the society.
We know that three states in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced this week
I especially express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the governance and the people of the state for fulfilling this task.
We know well that if we have to do something good in the life of a person, in the life of a society, then we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be cured, then we have to try to remain very aware for a long time.
Then the body of the body changes the habit of mind
The subject of cleanliness is the same
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature .
Everyone will have to attract attention
Good motivation events will have to be reminded of repeatedly
And I am happy that today cleanliness is not a government programme.
This is becoming a movement of the people and the people.
And when people sitting in the government take this task forward with public participation, how much strength increases
A very excellent event came to me in the past, which I would like to say to you
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration took a big job in public participation .
100-hour non stop campaign
And what was the target
Construction of ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 gram panchayats in one hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in governance, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district that you have presented a very inspiring example while executing your hard work.
NarendraModiApps, come on MyGov.in, come from letters, come on AIR.
Recalling the Emergency, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written that on 25th June, he has presented it as a black period in the history of democracy.
This awareness about the democracy of Prakash Tripathi ji is commendable and democracy is a system, it is not that it is also a ritual.
There is a need for daily awareness about democracy and therefore it has to be reminded of the trauma of democracy and it has to move forward in the direction of the good things of democracy.
1975 - 25th June - it was such a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into a prisoner.
The anti-voice was dubbed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were locked in jails.
The justice system was not able to escape from the shadow of that terrible form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Democracy lovers fought a big fight and the country like India, such a huge country, when the opportunity was found, how democracy was prevailing in the rage of the people of India, through the election, they demonstrated that strength.
We have to empower this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling pride in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - the entire world has become Yoga Day.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this
It is not that Yoga did not happen before, but today when Yoga has been tied in the thread of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this opportunity of Yoga their own.
In China, the Great All of China practiced Yoga on it, people at Peru have done Yoga at 2400 meters above sea level on World Heritage Site Machu Pichu.
In the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in France, people have done yoga.
The events took place at 70 locations in small places like Singapore and they have launched a week-long campaign.
NCC launches 10 stamps of International Yoga Day
The Hoga Session with Yoga Masters was organized in NCC leadership.
NCSTA, the world's diplomats, everyone participated in it.
This time again Yoga also worked as a world record
Nearly 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad in Gujarat together made a new world record
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing yoga in the rain
Our soldiers also did yoga in Siachen where Minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature occurs
Be it TBP, RP, IDS, everybody has made Yoga a part of his duty as well as his duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family should share their photographs together.
Some T Channel also carried forward this thing
Sir, I have a question that in recently Kerala, we had heard you that we should give kind of good books in place of the boute as we give on the deerent-deerent places.
You started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat too, sir, but now we are not getting to see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had established a tradition in the government that we would not give bouquets, books or handlooms, handkerchie would welcome it.
And the handkerchie of Khadi, so that Khadi can also be promoted
As long as I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But when he went to Kerala, he once again became aware
And I ' ve just started giving the following information in the government
We can gradually make a temperament
And the age of the bout is very small .
Once in hand, then leave
But if you give a book, then in a way it becomes part of the house, it becomes part of the family.
And when I am talking about this, how historical is the value of such things
When I went to the UK last year, I invited me to dinner in Britain's ueen, ueen Liabeth.
There was a mother-in-law environment
He also fed me with great love, but later he showed me a small khadi and a handkerchie woven with thread in a emotional voice with a great respect and shine in his eyes, he said that when I was married, then this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi sent me to the meeting as a best wishes for marriage.
How many years have passed, but ueen Liabeth has taken over the handkerchie given by Mahatma Gandhi
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be victims of criticism.
But in spite of that, such things should continue to be done, should continue to try
Now I cannot say that I will go somewhere and if someone will take a bouquet then I will refuse it, I will not be able to do it.
But still there will be criticism, but will continue to talk, then there will be gradually improvement.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are many kinds of works.
But I have developed a habit for me that I read some letters every day from the letters that come to me and that is why I get an opportunity to join the common man.
Various letters come, different types of people write letters
I got an opportunity to read such a letter these days, I think I must tell you
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewise of Madurai, Arulmozhi Sarvanan - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought of doing some economic activity in mind of the children's education in my family, then the family would get some financial help.
So I started some work from the Mudra Yojana, taking money from the bank and bringing some luggage from the market and supplying some luggage
I have noticed that the Government of India has set up a system called Government-Marketplace.
So I have also registered myself in it. I want to tell the countrymen that if you get the opportunity, then you will get the opportunity.
There is a big new kind of system .
And then he has to order
So, all the departments of the government keep watching those who get registered under GME.
Because of not being intermediaries things are very cheap .
Now this Arunmozhi Madam has given all the registry of the goods that he can give on this website of the government.
And funny is that the letter he wrote to me is a big interesting
This is the empowerment
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship
Perhaps Arunmozhi ji had not written a letter to me, I might have not even noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, his goods can be bought to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the country .
There is also a transparency in it, there is also an impoverment in it, it also has entrepreneurship.
I would surely want those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way to add more to it.
I believe that Minimum Governance and Maimum Governance is an excellent example of this and its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we can also be proud of our achievements in Space Science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground connected with Yoga, then our dreams are to cross the horizons of the far-flung skys.
India has shown a lot in sports and science in the past.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on space.
Just two days ago, ISR launched 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 Series Satellite
And these satellites include about 14 countries in addition to India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America.
And this Nano Satellite Campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of agriculture, in the field of natural calamities.
And this is the most weighty heavy satellite in the satellite that India has launched so far.
And the newspapers of our country compared it with the weight of the elephant, so you can imagine how much work our scientists have done in the field of space.
A thousand days of Mars Mission have been completed on 19th June
You all will know that when we successfully built a place in Orbit for the Mars Mission, this entire mission was for a six-month period.
Finishing a thousand days is an important stop within our scientific journey, our space journey.
These days in sports also we are seeing that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has started to be seen that our younger generations have started showing their future in sports along with studies and because of our sportspersons, their sportspersons and their achievements, the country's name is also illuminated.
Recently, India's Badminton Player Kidambi Srikant has won the Indonesia Open and increased the country's value
I heartily congratulate them and their coach for this achievement.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track of the Athletes School of Athletics of P. T.
We also bring sports and sportsman spirit as much as we will promote the game.
Sports also plays a very important role in the development of personality
Sports is very important in the overall personality development
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family too, then they should give opportunity.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, Rainfall, the atmosphere of continuous festivals, in a way it is a new feeling of time.
I will once again convey my best wishes to all of you at the time of the next Mann Ki Baat
This year's heat will hardly be forgotten.
But the rain is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community, on this holy month.
This is a country that people who believe in God and those who reject God, those who oppose idol worship and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have absorbed the art of living together.
And in the end, religion, sect, ideology, tradition, this message gives us the same message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely be helpful in furthering this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
I once again wish everyone the best.
I am happy that many people gave me a feedback.
Individually everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me my point.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not even heard the messages of everyone, so many things have come.
However, I have seen that some people have tried to learn music, some people are trying to learn new languages using you tube, some are trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some people have written that we have started writing poems.
Knowing, living, understanding nature is trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much India had to struggle for independence, how many freedom fighters spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I am requesting you to give some messages to the generation of today.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
Cellular went to see jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a Maji Birth Book in jail.
They used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
What torture will the freedom fighters have suffered
When I read a book born to Savarkar ji's Maji and I got inspiration to see the cellular jail.
There is also a light and sound show programme that is a very inspiring person.
There was no such state in India, there would be no language speaker of India who had suffered the punishment of black water for independence in the Andaman jail, in this cellular jail, had not spent his youth.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, the people of every language, the people of every province and every generation had tortured.
I will surely tell the younger generation of the country that people had suffered the torture of the freedom that we have got, how hard they had suffered, if we go to Cellular Jail and see why black water was called
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connect with nature means nurturing the best plan.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times that one must care a world one will not see that we will not see the world, it is our duty to worry about it, we should also take care of it.
You have come very tired, open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
A new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy appears in our body, when the punchs are connected to the Mahabhutas.
We all have experienced it, but we do not register it, we do not add it to a thread and a formula.
After this you must see that whenever you are in touch with the natural condition, a new consciousness will emerge in you and that is why the global campaign to connect with the nature of June 5 should also be our own campaign.
Our ancestors have protected the environment, we are getting some benefits from it.
If we protect, then our future generations will benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in the Vedas.
And, in a way, Atharvaveda is the biggest guiding text of the environment and has been written thousands of years ago.
It has been said here: Mata Bhoomi: Sons Important Prithviya:
It has been said in the Vedas that the priity in us is due to our earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is highlighted that Mahatma Buddha was born, he was born under the three trees of knowledge and his great renownance.
These days I have news from the states.
A very big campaign of plantation is going on in almost all the states as soon as rains come.
Plants are planted in crores of rupees.
The children of the school are also connected, the social-service organizations are connected, the NGOs are connected, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we also promote this work of plantation in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a well-known day for the world.
The whole world celebrates it as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day of 21st June has failed in every corner and is connecting people.
On one hand, many powers of scattering in the world are showing their distorted faces, at such a time the world has a great contribution to India.
We have added the world to one formula through yoga.
Like yoga connects body, mind, intellect and soul, Yoga is also connecting the world today.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to increased responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress free life.
And this situation has reached even at small ages.
Yoga's role is crucial for a stress-free life in such a time when it is going to take unnamed medicines and passing the day.
Yoga is the guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through Yoga to experience that interaction of health from body, mind, body, thoughts and conduct.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some rewards have been announced.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and told me that you should appeal that this time on the third International Yoga Day, three generations of the same family will do yoga together.
Be it grandparents or grandparents, parents, sons and daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow there will be a pleasant coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched a campaign with self-defter and a very interesting experience came.
The picture of these three generations will definitely awaken the commendation for the country and the world.
You must send a picture to me on the NarendraModiApp, wherever three generations do yoga on MyGov.
Tomorrow, this will be a picture of today and tomorrow, which will be the guarantee of pleasant tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have nearly three weeks for International Yoga Day.
You should also propagate the subject of yoga for three weeks continuously, broadcast, connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive healthcare.
I invite you all to join it.
You will also come to mind from this phone call: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today, I always see Modi ji TV and in social media, wherever you go, the people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
There has been awareness about cleanliness in the elderly, children too.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, hatching.
There the government machinery works for cleaning but these days a cleaning festival is also made in the society.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleaning programmes.
The media also gives him a big priority, just a few days ago I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a big cleaning campaign there.
I did not even see it by adding it.
But when this phone call came, I also started thinking and I saw that yes, this is true.
You can imagine, I am happy to know how much the country is notifying these things in a better way.
What will be more happy for me than this that cleanliness has also been linked to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be the habit of getting ready- but cleanliness will be the main thing.
It is pleasant and inspiring for any sanitation lover in itself.
I congratulate all those who emphasize this cleanliness work.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well that's a big joke suggestion.
I don't know, I will not be able to do it.
Modi ji, whenever you decide to stay, tell them that if I want to call, then how will the level of cleanliness be
How many tons of waste and waste will you offer me on the basis of that I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big humanity will be worked.
One thing I would like to say that we do not consider this waste, it is wealth, it is a source.
Do not see it just as a carbage.
Once we start accepting this waste and waste as wealth, many new ways of waste management will come to us.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a major mission of waste management with the help of people representatives of the cities.
On June 5, on World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities of the country will get solid waste, live waste and solid waste.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one of green color and the other of blue color.
Like the waste of kitchen, the peels of vegetables, the remaining food, the egg peels, the leaves of trees and plants, all these are wet wastes and put them in green dustbin.
All these things are such that works in the field and if you remember the green color of the field then you will remember what to put in the green dustbin.
Today, with pride, I have to mention one thing - if a person decides in mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
The work of cleanliness is the same.
And the way in which he connected the people of the entire region and converted it into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, I was told that the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free (Open Defecation Free).
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been leaded by the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out torch visits to spread awareness and inspired the people of home-house, streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the month, continuous newspapers, TV channels, social media, the accounting of the present government is going on for three years.
I see all this process as very healthy signs.
How has this 3-year tenure been done on every criterion
The people of every section of the society have done their analysis.
And there is an excellent process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that governments should be accountable in democracy, public and public should account for their work.
I thank all those people who took time out and discussed our work in depth, somewhere appreciated, somewhere support came, some deficiencies were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
It is good, less good, bad, whatever it is, to learn from it and to move forward with the help of it.
Constructive creativity strengthens democracy.
This churning is very important for a conscious nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, good and bad effects are on me as well as on the minds of a common citizen.
Some people also criticise it from a political point of view, but after such a long experience I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think of it.
It seems like I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I am grateful to the President, to the Vice President, to the Speaker, that the people sitting in such a senior position took time out and gave this importance to the mindset.
In a way, gave a new dimension to the matter of mind in itself.
When some of our friends were working on the book of this mind, I had ever discussed with me.
A artist who lives in Abu Dhabi is known as Akbar Saheb. Akbar Saheb proposed that the topics that have been discussed in the matter of Mann Ki Baat, they want to prepare their sketch through their art and without giving a single rupee, Akbar Saheb gave the form of art to showcase his love.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, the next time when you meet, there will be rains in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of education and life will start with a new fresh smell, a new fragrance, a new fragrance, a new fragrance.
Let us all move forward in this environment by love for nature.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
S.
Should this aspect be a little stressed in skill development
You drive a cycle, but a cycle with three-wheeler who takes people - what have you ever tried to run
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in their children ' s worms .
Those who have finished their livelihood, there will be some relief and there will be a little pressure in those families where Weam runs.
But at such a time I would like to say that once again listen to the things I have spoken to the students in the matter of Mann Ki Baat, those things will definitely help you at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bang-Bandhu
And I wish Bangladesh to move forward, develop and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region by mixing shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, we have a shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
One very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, but he was also given the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British killed Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voice and this was the time when a 12-year-old child had a deep impact on this incident.
In adolescence, the brutal murder of Jallianwala Bagh had given a new inspiration to the child laughing and laughing in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old child Bhagat is our beloved, we all are inspired - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that incident on March 23 - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru on the face of Maa-Bharati was not afraid of death
All the dreams of life were included for the freedom of Mother India
And these three heroes are still inspired by all of us
We will not be able to decorate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words
And the entire British kingdom was afraid of these three young men .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but how to move forward with them, the British were worried about it.
And only then was to be hanged on March 24, but was given on March 23
It was stolen, which is not usually done
And later his body was brought to Punjab today and the British quietly burnt it.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt a kind of vibration in that land.
And I will say to the youth of the country - whenever you get the opportunity, whenever you go to Punjab, you must go to the place of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's Mataji and Batukeshwar Dutt's tomb.
This was the time when the glimpse of freedom, its intensity, its widespread was increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru had inspired the youth for armed revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, it was first seen in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in terms of struggle.
This was the period, the satyagraha of Champaran, Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of workers in Ahmedabad, and all these seem to have a deep impact on Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and style of functioning.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind.
Imagine that a man who came back to India in 1915, just a two-year term
Neither the country knew them, nor was their effect, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they have to suffer at that time, how hard they have to work.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organization skills, the power to know the pulse of Mahatma Gandhi's Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's behaviour to organise the poorest of the poor, illiterately illiterate people for struggle, to bring them to the ground for struggle, to see this wonderful power.
And that ' s why we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who starts public life.
We can learn from them how to initiate public life, how to work and how Gandhi did it
And that was the time when we listen to the names of the big leaders, Gandhiji was Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani ji and everyone was sent to the villages.
To fill the jail on one side, on the other hand to spend yourself in creative works
A big amazing balance was in the style of Gandhi's work
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what is non-cooperation in front of such a big Sultanate - a whole new dimension was introduced by Gandhi, not by words, through a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, who will be such a Indian who does not want to change India, who will be a Indian who does not want to become a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government programme nor a political party has a manifestation, nor is it a project
India is the call of 125 crore Indians
This is the feeling that hundred and fifty million Indians want to make a grand India together
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help the patients
Many people are, they run for blood donation as soon as they know
Many people are, someone is hungry, then they worry about his food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
Public service is the Lord-Service, it is in our ragas
Once we see it as a collective, organized, then how big it is
If it is a matter of India, then it is very natural to criticize it, to discuss it, to see it from different points of view and it is inevitable in democracy.
But it is true that if one hundred and fifty crore countrymen decide the way to prove their resolve, take one step after one step, then the dream of New India and hundred and fifty crore Indians can be proved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things happen from budget, government projects and government funds.
If every citizen resolves that I follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen resolves that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full honesty, if every citizen resolves that one day in a week I will not use petrol diesel in my life.
You see this country, which is dreaming of a New India, one hundred and fifty crore Indians, will be able to see it true in front of your eyes.
It means that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows duty
So why should not we be associated with Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you today.
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country, a large number of people joined the Digital Payments Digital Movement.
Without cash transactions, his curiosity has also increased, he is trying to learn the poorest of the poor and gradually people are moving towards it without cash business.
Since the demonetisation notebook, there has been considerable increase in different ways of digital payment
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
125 crore Indians can resolve to work for two and a half thousand crore digital transactions in this year
We have announced in the budget
we can do this in everyday life .
You don't imagine, but you can serve the country very big and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
In the past, there have been several programmes of the Digidhan Mela for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programs have been done
There was also a reward scheme in it
Nearly 12.5 lakh people have received this reward from the consumer .
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
This Digi Mela will be concluded on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
It's going to be a big event after a hundred days.
There is also a provision for a very big draw .
How to reduce cash, how to reduce the behavior of notes, we should contribute to it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time I seek suggestions from people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions.
But I have seen that every time there is a request for cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has sent a message by phone: - Honble Principal, Prime Minister, greet you my presentation
First of all, thank you very much that you have won by heavy votes in this election
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is
I pass through the river every day in which people pour a lot of garbage and contaminate the rivers
The river comes through the Rispna bridge and also comes to my house .
We went to the towns for this river and took out a rally and talked to the people , but it did not benefit .
I want to tell you that by sending one of my teams or through the newspaper this thing should be exposed, thanks.
See Brothers and sisters, how much pain is the daughter of class 11
Seeing the waste in that river, how much he is getting angry
I consider it a good sign .
I want this to be the anger of the dirt in the minds of the hundred and fifty million people.
Once there will be anger, anger will arise, anger will arise against him, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is a good thing that Gayatri himself is also expressing his anger, suggesting me, but he himself is also saying that he has made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
hatred towards dirt is also increasing
Be awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But the sanitation movement is more related to habits .
It's difficult to work, but I have to do it.
I am confident that the feelings that have awakened in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, indicate the good results in itself.
Whatever Gayatri is listening to today's Mann Ki Baat, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should become a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been meeting several suggestions on one thing from the very beginning and most of the people have expressed concern about food waste.
Half of the plates they do not even fill in the stomach and then leave there and leave there.
You have ever thought how much we waste from what we leave these lips.
Have you ever imagined that if you do not leave the jute, how many poor people can fill their stomach
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
When the mother serves younger children in our family, she says that the son can eat as much as you can.
There is some effort but still apathy on this subject is a sedition.
There is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there is a saving, then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this topic is such that the benefit of the family is also the beneficiary.
I am not urging more on this subject, but I would like to increase this awareness.
You will find such people somewhere in every state of India.
Their life can also inspire people that we should not unite.
We should take as much food as we have.
Look, this is the only way to change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say - keep the stomach even a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
And when it has come to health, on April 7, the World Health Day is the World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of universal health coverage by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word 'Expression' but if we have to make a verbal meaning, then some people also call it depression.
It is estimated that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally suffering from expression.
The problem is that even in our surroundings, we do not understand this and perhaps we hesitate to speak openly about this subject.
The person who feels an expression himself does not speak anything because he feels a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that the expression is not such that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment has to be created and it starts.
The first mantra is that instead of suppression of the expression, its experiment is required.
Besides your friends, friends, parents, brothers, teachers, openly tell you what is happening to you
Sometimes the children living in the hostel, especially in the hostel, have a lot of trouble.
Everybody in the house is going out somewhere, he says - No, I don't have to come here today - I like to stay alone.
Have you ever noticed why it does
You must believe that it is the first step in the direction of the expression.
If he does not like to stay in the group, he is going alone in one corner, then try to see that he does not allow it to happen.
Give him the opportunity to stay in the midst of those people who talk openly with him.
Please motivate him for the expression while talking openly about the joy of the joy of the joy of the joy of the joy.
This is the best solution .
And the expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Like Diabetes becomes the host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities to sustain, fight, to dare and decide.
Your friends, your family, your campus, your environment can also prevent you from going to the exhibition.
There is another way in the IDF.
Help your mind, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, your internal pain will go away like this.
If you try to understand their sorrows, you will do with service, you will have a new self-confidence.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and by serving with selflessness, you can easily lighten the burden of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Free from stress, liberation from pressure, journey towards happy mind - Yoga helps a lot.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion regarding the 3rd International Yoga Day in your mind, you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application, guide me.
The songs and poetic compositions you can prepare for Yoga should be done so that people can easily understand it.
I would like to talk to the mothers and sisters today because today the discussion of health has come out very well, the health matters have been sufficient.
So in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
The working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing and it is welcome but women also have special responsibilities.
The Government of India has made a big decision.
These working class women will now be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, during pregnancy, during delivery and maternity leave which was available for the first 12 weeks.
There are probably two or three countries in the world which are ahead of us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And his original aim is to take care of that newborn, the future citizen of India, to take care of him in the early days of birth, to get his immense love for the mother, then these children will grow up and become the trust of the country.
The health of mothers will also be good and that is why this is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April, the auspicious festival of Ramnavmi is Mahavir Jayanti on 9th April, Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary on 14th April.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us, give us the strength to resolve for New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Sanvatsar, I extend my best wishes to you all for this new year.
This is the time for farmers to start cooking after spring and get the fruits of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in different corners of our country in different forms.
In Maharashtra, Gudi-Padwa, Andhra-Karnataka as a New Year, Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh region, Shital in Mithila in Bihar and Satruvani in Magadh are celebrated on New Year.
Innumerable India is a country full of diversity.
Winter season is going to go now
The spring season has knocked us all in life
New leaves start coming in the trees after the fall .
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The rhythm of the birds begins to love the mind .
Not only flowers, fruits also shine in the sunshine on the branches of the tree
The fruits of summer turmeric start appearing in the spring of mango .
At the same time, yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind hopes to the farmers
Tesu or palash indicates the coming of flower holi .
Wealthy Khusro has enjoyed the moments of this change in weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami , Mahashivaratri and Holi puts the color of happiness in human life .
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood, humanity, we are going to leave Phalgun last month and we are ready to welcome the new month chaitra.
The spring is a coincidence of these two months
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country that before the talk of mind, when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On Narendra ModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by mail, I am grateful to everyone for this.
And that ' s why he said I ' ll give some information about the launch and interceptor mission of 104 satellites
Shobha ji, you have remembered the example of Indias pride.
Whether it is to deal with poverty, to avoid diseases, to connect with the world, to reach knowledge and knowledge - technology and science have registered their place.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias life
Our scientists have raised India's head proudly before the world
SERC has successfully launched 104 satellites in space through Mega Mission, including USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India.
India became the world's first country to make history by sending 104 satellites together in space
And it is also a matter of happiness that this is the successful launch of the 38th PSU consistently
It is a historic achievement for SER, but for the whole of India.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - Cartosat 2 - this is the satellite of India and it will help them to plan the pictures, resources, infrastructure, development, urban development.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water resources are there in the country, how can it be used, what should be taken care of, this new satellite artosat 2 will help in all these subjects.
Our satellite has sent some photos as soon as it goes
He has started his work .
It is also a matter of happiness for us that all this campaign has been led by our young scientists and our women scientists.
Such a strong participation of youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always maintained their objective of bringing space science to the common man, for the service of the nation, and they are also creating new records everyday.
The less than we congratulate these scientists and their entire team
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement, about it.
This has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji has taken care of this important thing.
This mission with interception technology successfully marked the enemy's mission at a height of about 100 km from the ground during its attempt.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security .
And you will be happy to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have the power to do so.
When we see new technologies, there is a new scientific achievement then we enjoy people.
And curiosity has played a very important role in the development journey of human life
And those distinguished intellectuals who do not allow curiosity to live in the form of curiosity, they also raise questions within them, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And that curiosity becomes the cause of new discovery
They do not sit comfortably until they get the answer
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is no longer a complete stop.
Please stop is impossible
An effort to know the universe, the rules of creation, the mind of human beings continues to go on.
New science, new technologies are produced from it.
And every technology, every new science, gives birth to a new age
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today's scientists are the cause of a permanent change in the lives of generations to come.
In the past, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a major universal competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Social useful innovation was invented
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science to solve .
It means that in society, people of this kind of role in the country are very much
And our society is also becoming technology-driven
Arrangements are becoming technology-driven
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life
Digi-Dhan is showing great emphasis in the past.
Gradually people are moving out of cash and moving forward towards digital currency
Digital transactions in India are growing at a rapid pace.
In our country, the Lucky Customer Scheme, the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme has got huge support.
About two months have passed, 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day.
And it is a matter of happiness that so far 10 lakh people have got rewards under the Digi-Dhan scheme, more than 50,000 traders have got rewards and more than 150 crore rupees have been given to those who have taken this great campaign in this reward.
Under this scheme, there are more than 100 customers who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received rewards of Rs. 50,000.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it, they are also getting benefits.
When I asked his analysis that brothers, you see only the youngsters who come to the age group, I am happy that those who receive the reward are 15 years old and those who are 15-70 years old.
Shri Santosh ji from Mysore has written on Narendra ModiApp that he received a reward of Rs. 1,000 under the Lucky Customer Scheme.
Now they drive the cars, but in a way they have become the ambassador of this scheme.
All passenger gets the knowledge of digital all the time .
I am very enthusiastic and encouraging others.
I would like to urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country to make this Lucky Customer Scheme either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme which they have received.
You should lead this movement.
You should take this forward and this work has a very important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, in my vision, there is a new anti-corruption cadre in the country.
In a way, you are a soldier of purity.
You know that Lucky Customer Plan - 100 days when it will be completed
14th April is the festival of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On April 14, a very big price of crores of rupees will be drawn.
There are about forty-fifteen days left now.
Can you do one thing while remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
The 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has just gone away.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and CBI
I would like to say that the foundation stone laid by Dr. Baba Saheb has to be strengthened.
The BIM app has to be connected to 125 crore hands by visiting the household.
The impact of the movement that has been undertaken for the last two-three months is that several townships, several villages and several cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture is a major contributor to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic momentum of the country.
I want to tell you about a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the food stores with hard work.
This year, with the hard work of farmers in our country, there has been a record food production.
All indications are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time in the fields there is such a wave, every day, like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is more than 8 more than the last record of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated different pulses on about two hundred ninety lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
My request to my farmer brothers and sisters are specially thankful for the way the farmers of my country worked hard on their heads and their record production of pulses.
My dear countrymen, this is going on in our country, by the government, by society, by institutions, by organizations, by everyone, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everyone is seeing awareness about cleanliness in some form or the other.
The Government has been making steady efforts.
In the past, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation of the Government of India, led by our Secretary, a programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments was organized in Telangana.
And Telangana is not just a seminar in the closed rooms in Warangal, but what is the significance of the work of direct hygiene.
On 17-18 February, the Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad.
Cleaning the toilet pits of six households, the officials themselves showed that the pits used by the two pit toilets can be evacuated and used again.
He also showed how comfortable these new technological toilets are and there is no hesitation in cleaning them, there is no hesitation in which psychological barrier is there.
And we can also clean the pits of a toilet just like that.
And as a result of this endeavour, the media of the country has propagated it very much, it has given importance to it and it is natural when it is an integral institution.
If you clean the toilet pit itself, then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And this is the cleaning of the toilet pit and those whom we consider to be waste and waste, but if you look at it from the point of view of fertilizer, then in a way it is black gold.
We can see what wealth is from waste.
And that ' s proved
A standard Twin Pit Toilet for a six-member family is filled in about five years.
After this, waste can be easily removed and redirected in the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste deposited in the pit becomes completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle decomposed waste and most important fertilizer from the point of view of fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well familiar with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - these are full of nutritious elements and are considered to be the best fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken these initiatives, others have also taken several such initiatives.
And now Doordarshan has a special programme of cleanliness news .
The more such things will be highlighted, the more will be beneficial.
Different departments also celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regulations in the government.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Tribal Aires Ministry, is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March and two Ministries - Ministry of Shipping Shipping, Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Reservation - these Ministries are also going to carry forward the sanitation campaign for the last two weeks of March.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy and enhances confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang players in Rio Paralimpics.
In the final of Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan for the second consecutive time and enhanced the pride of the country by becoming a world champion
I once again congratulate all the team players
The country is proud of the achievement of our Divyang colleagues
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, are brave and determined.
Every moment we can get something to learn from them
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
Acrossing the footsteps and illuminating the name of the country with its achievements .
In the last few days, Asian Rubby Sevens Trophy won the silver medal by our women players
My best wishes to all those players
8th March celebrates World Women's Day
In India, giving importance to daughters, awareness towards them in family and society, sensitivity increases
Beti Bachao Beti Teacho This movement is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it's not just a government program
This has become a social sensitivity campaign for public education.
During the last two years, this programme has added to the common man, has forced people to think on this burning issue in every corner of the country and has brought about a change in the thinking of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When it is reported that the festival was celebrated on the birth of daughter, it is so enjoyable.
In a way positive thinking towards daughters is becoming a cause of social acceptance .
I have heard that the Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu state banned child marriage under a special campaign
More than 175 child marriages have been stopped so far
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samridhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all departments have been linked to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Yojana and along with orphan girls adopted by the district administration, their education and their efforts are being made.
A campaign is being launched to educate the village-village, house-to-house daughters under every household knock program in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to rectify and motivate the girls who had been drop-out by running their child, their school campaign.
It means that Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho This movement has also taken several forms.
The whole movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been turned as per local requirements
You also keep connecting with activity
You get me to know a lot
What is going on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the village and the poor, it reaches me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav was celebrated across India
Anyone can imagine how the personality will be, that even after thousands of years, every festival comes with innovation, brings new inspiration, brings new energy and thousands of years old life that can give examples to solve the problems today, can inspire, everyone can find solutions to the problems of Shri Krishna's life.
Sometimes the work of picking up the rocks, sometimes picking up the leaf of food, that is, everything feels a newness and therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I, I, towards two Mohan, my attention goes on.
One Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, and the other Charkhadhari Mohan
The Sudarshan Chakradhari, except the Yamuna coast, went to the sea coast in Gujarat, settled in the city of Dwarka and came to the coast of the Yamuna and took the last breath of life in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan had utilised his intellect, his duties, his capabilities, his thoughts in the circumstances of that time, even thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle, and to avoid the struggle, to utilize his duties, and to utilize his thinking, and Charkhadhari Mohan also chose such a way, to enable freedom, to preserve human values, to enable the basic elements of personality - for this, he gave such a turn that is amazing for the whole world, even today it is wonderful.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of moving ahead while smiling between all the fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why Shrikrishna has also been known as Jagatguru Krishna Vande Jagadgurum
Today, when we are discussing the festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is discussed not only in India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
He served the farmers with whom there was a distinction in Champaran, who served those mill labourers who were not being given proper wages, who considered the service of the poor, the destitute, the weak and the hungry as the supreme duty of their lives.
Anyone who, whenever needed, was always present for the service of Mahatma Gandhi.
He stressed not only on service but also on self-help associated with it.
The meaning of the word ' Seva ' is to be done with joy - Seva Parmo Dharma :
But, simultaneously, excellent joy, comfortably, the feeling of this feeling is also in service,
We can understand this well by Bapu's life.
This was all for Mahatma Gandhi, individual and society, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, they have always been insistent on social promotion community mobilization in a unique way.
It is my privilege that I have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the organization with service.
Social service and Social Promotion Community Service and Community Mobilisation is the spirit that we have to bring in our practical life.
In the right sense, this is a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, a true karanjali
No countrymen
and collectiveness has one of its own strengths
In this entire, Gandhi 150 programme, there should be collectiveness and service.
Our ladies club is
The works of the modern age ladies clubs will continue to be done, but all the figures of the ladies club will work together with some or the other service work.
can do a lot
Collect books, distribute old, disseminate the poor, spread knowledge, and I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore undertakings.
There is no limit that comes to the mind - just goodwill, always, goodwill and service of complete dedication and that too free: pleasure: - for the experience of an exclusive joy
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi, is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings arising from within your minds will be more powerful than any greater literature and it may be possible that in today's time, in your sight, the form of a Gandhi written by your pen, perhaps it may be more relevant.
A lot of programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming time.
But in this context one thing is very interesting that I want to share with you
Haripura Panels were particularly interesting in it
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura, Gujarat where the incident of Subhash Chandra Bose's Presidential election is recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Kala Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and perform this art work during the session .
This is the same Nand Lal Bose whose art work enhances the beauty of our Constitution .
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his art sadhana has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution .
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showcasing the lives of rural India
This precious artist had a tremendous discussion in the Enfice
Once again, with the best wishes of Gandhiji on the 150th Birth Anniversary, I expect some resolution from every Indian.
We should do something for the country, for the society, for someone else.
This will be Bapu's good, true, authentic work
You will remember that in the last few years, we run Swachhta Hi Seva Abhiyan across the country for about 2 weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start from 11th September
During this time we will leave our homes and pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan
Whether it is home or corridors, square-square or drains, schools, colleges to run a massive campaign for cleanliness at all public places
In the same way we have to finish the use of single plastic together .
This will save money and they will be able to contribute to the protection of the environment
This time on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, on this occasion, we will not only dedicate them to an open defecation free India, but also lay the foundation stone for a new mass movement against plastic throughout the country.
Celebrate 2nd October as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal when all these plastic wastes are collected.
This can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste till Diwali .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit Subhashit is a gem of knowledge in a way.
We can get what we want in life
These days my contact has become very low but earlier my contact was very much .
Stupid people call stone as gems
Our culture has great glory of food .
Until We have changed the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation for the future of our society.
Under the Poshan Abhiyan, nutrition is being made a mass movement through modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought to me
Inside Nashik a handful of rice has become a big movement .
In this , in the days of crop harvesting , Anganwadi workers collect a handful of grains from the people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women
The donor in it becomes a vigilant citizen social servant in a way .
After that he himself is dedicated to this goal, he becomes a soldier of that movement.
All of us have heard about food rituals in every corner of India in families
This ritual is done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
No solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 that on the occasion of Anna Prashan Sanskar, children should be given complimentary food so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very magnificent initiative that can be adopted everywhere
In many states people run date meal campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, some auspicious day, some memory day, then the people of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and making tasty food, go to schools and the people of the family themselves serve and feed the children.
They share their joy and increase in joy .
A wonderful mixture of service and joy .
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, poor and prosperous, both families are affected.
The month of September to be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyan across the country
You must join it, take information, add some new ones, contribute.
If you bring a single person out of malnutrition means we bring the country out of malnutrition
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions about this matter and this would happen and in the last few weeks wherever I met the people of Man vs.
I have not only been associated with the youth of India but also with this episode. I have never thought that this will become my place in young hearts like this.
I have never thought of how many diverse the youth of our country and the world pay attention to things
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of the young people around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to visit as the Prime Minister and due to International Yoga Day, the situation has become such that if I go to anyone in the world, then I don't ask me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed with me about yoga and it has come to my experience all over the world.
But these days a new experience is coming
Whatever one gets, wherever one gets the opportunity to talk, he discusses Wildlife, discusses environment.
Tiger, lion, organism and I am surprised how much people are interested
Discovery has planned to broadcast this program in 165 countries in their language
I hope that in such a situation, this programme will help the world in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity towards nature in the Sanskrit Yatra of India, this episode of this discovery channel has become a strong belief and people now want to know the steps taken towards climate justice and clean environment in our India.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also hesitate to ask me one thing that Modi ji , tell me that you were speaking Hindi and beer Grills didn ' t know Hindi , how was there a rapid pace between you
Is this later edited
Is this so frequent shooting
ask with great curiosity .
See, there's no secret in it
Reality is that technology was used in conversations with Bear Grylls
So I used to say Hindi but it was heard by English and because of it the dialogue became very easy and this is the wonder of technology .
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit Nature and Wildlife Nature and places related to organisms.
I have said earlier, I must say that you must go to the North-East in your life.
will extend within you
The country filled with diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher, as well as from within.
Last month I had the privilege of issuing Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The population of tigers in India is 2967
A few years ago half of it was harder than we
Tiger Summit was held in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 about tigers
In this, a resolution was taken expressing concern over the declining number of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers across the world by Twenty Twenty Two 2022
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reserves has increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the lion's habitat was shrinking in the jungles of Gir.
Their number was decreasing
We took several steps after one in Gir .
In 2007, decided to deploy women guards there
Improve infrastructure to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about conservation.
But, now we have to go beyond conservation and think about compassion
Our scriptures also have a very good guidance on this subject .
Therefore, we need not only to preserve our forests, vegetation and wildlife but also to create an environment so that they can grow properly
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekanand Ji on September 11, 1893
This young monk of India, who shaken the entire world's human race, has left India's stimulating identity in the world.
The slave that the world was looking at India with a very distorted feeling that the words of great men like Swami Vivekananda forced the world to change the view of looking towards India
Let us see the form of India that Swami Vivekanandji had seen.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that 29th August is celebrated as the National Sports Day.
This will be a big interesting campaign for children, elderly, youth, women for everyone and it will be your own.
But today I ' m not going to tell her nuances
I want to make you aware about the fitness and set some goals together for the country for it India.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you on 29th August in India
Let us move with a new zeal, new resolution, new power.
My dear countrymen, today we will meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
I'll wait for your words, your suggestions
Let us all come together to fulfil Gandhi's dreams to make India of the dreams of freedom fighters, let us go freely: dry:
Walk while expressing the inner joy with service .
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On January 26, our Republic Day was celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this ritual festival is also a celebration that makes the future generations aware about democracy, towards democratic responsibilities and rituals.
However, in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens - the depth of debate that should be debated, the widespread discussion that should be discussed is not happening yet.
I hope that at every level, at every time, as much strength is given on the rights, the same strength should be given on duties.
Only on two tracks of rights and duty, the train of India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Tomorrow is January 30, the virtue of our revered Bapu is the date.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping 11 o'clock in the morning, 2 minutes silent.
As a society, as a country, 2 minutes of homage at 30th January, 11th, it should become a comfortable nature.
Why not be 2 minutes, but it also expresses collectiveness, resolution and reverence for the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army, for the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who were honored with various gallantry awards and their families.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, many categories.
When they know deeply about their courage, bravery and valour, we are also surprised and proud, we also get inspiration.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the zeal and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir, who are engaged in the defense of the country, got the bravery due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you know well that I continue to talk about the mind.
January, February, March, April - all these months take place in every family, in the criterion.
There are one-and-a-half children in the house but the entire family is buried in the burden of Ceam.
So I was convinced that this is the right time that I should talk to the students friends, talk to their prosecutors, talk to their teachers because for many years, wherever I went, where I got the exam, the reason for a big problem has come to light.
Family troubled, student disturbed, teacher disturbed, a big strange psychological environment is seen in every house.
And I have always felt that we should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in detail today.
I got a telephone message from the creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere cannot be happy
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in everyone's mind.
The examination should be a happy opportunity in itself.
It has worked hard for a year, now it has come to tell you that this festival of enthusiasm should be celebrated.
There are very few people for whom there is a pleasure in Ceam and for most people Ceam is a Pressure.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a pleasure that you will consider it as a pressur.
Those who believe in the Pleasure will be able to get those who believe in the Pressure will regret.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when the festival takes place, when the festival takes place, the best that happens within us comes out.
The feeling of the power of the society is also at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
There should also be an atmosphere of festival between the entire family, friends and neighbours in CHEAM.
You see, this will become a convergence in the Pressure, Pleasure.
Festival environment will make burden-free.
And I urge the parents to make an atmosphere of this festival for three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months of examinations take place.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months into festivals every year, taking our traditions and taking the environment of our families.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smile, you find rela and you become simply relaxed and when you are rela, you can easily remember your years old things.
A year ago, the whole scene is remembered by Teacher in classroom.
And you should know that the power to recall the memorial is the highest in the relationship.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, do not go inside, does not come out.
There is a halt in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
How did you remember outside
But whoever was inside, came out immediately and came out because you became rela.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall the memorial then it is a relationship.
And I tell myself that if there is a Pressure, then we forget our things and are rela, we can never imagine, we suddenly remember such things, they become very useful.
But when there is a tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets suppressed and your tension gets on it.
And that is why it is important that A Happy Mind is the sector for a good market-sheet, sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exams in proper perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
Whatever you are going to pay, it is a fame of what you have studied in a year.
This is not the test of your life.
How you live, how you live, how you want to live and how you want to live.
In your lives, in classrooms, apart from the examinations conducted by taking notebook, there will be opportunities to pass through several criteria.
And therefore, the exams have nothing to do with the success of life, get rid of such burdens.
They went to the Air Force to join the Air Force.
Assume, if they were disappointed and lost their lives due to that failure, would India get such a big scientific scientific and such a big President
The points have become the most important.
Because of this, the competition has increased very much, as well as the tension in the students has also increased very much.
So I would like to be aware of your ideas about this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he himself has answered, but tea wants me to keep something in it too.
Marks and Marks-sheets are a limited use of it.
Everything that doesn't happen in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have acquired.
Life goes on that you have tried to live what you have to go
Life goes on that what you have got a sense of mission and what is your sense of ambition, is there a coordination between your mission and ambition
If you believe in these things, you will never have to run behind the Marks while pressing the marks.
Knowledge will help you in life, skill will work, self-confidence will work, will work.
You should tell me that there will be a doctor of your family and all the people of your family will have to go to them and there are family doctors.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case, do you see the marks-sheet of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge, his journey of success.
And that is why the burden of these points sometimes prevents us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that it is not just to read.
It needs to be used for your test.
I was yesterday, I said today, he needs to know.
But if you focus on points, focus on marks, you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get only marks.
So it may be that despite being promising in the CHAM, sometimes they fail in life.
Cha ji, one thing has said competition.
This is a very big psychological fight.
Most of the successful sportspersons have a feature of their lives that they compete.
If we take an example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking their own records, defeating themselves every time and moving forward.
It is a wonderful life journey for them, because they adopted the path of more competition than competition.
Friends in every field of life and when you are going to give zeam then if you were able to read it for two hours first, can they do it for three hours
From inside, that energy is born on its own.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with very trust.
If you evil against it, you will be unhappy and disappointed, you will be filled with jealousy, the jealousy that you will eat, yourself, and if you are equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
Just focus on this thing.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the questions of math.
Once you will learn to access, the maximum problem will end.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Accepting the state, gives the opportunity to open new paths and therefore, access what is there.
You will also be burden free.
When one of our familiar persons was in the hospital due to heart attack, then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India, Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, he was also a MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that they did not come and ask a single question about their health.
As soon as he sat down, what is the situation there, what is the illness, what is the matter, what is the matter, what is the matter, what is the matter, what is the jokes, and in the first two-four minutes, he made such an atmosphere light.
As we go to a sick person in a way, we scare the illness.
I would like to tell the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that in the days of CHEAM, children will also be given an atmosphere of joy and happiness.
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I have got a phone call of a big wonder.
They do not want to tell the gentlemen their name.
Listening to the phone, you will know why they do not want to tell their name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can't tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I had tried to copy once in my childhood, I started preparing a lot for it that I tried to find out how I can imitate it, due to which a lot of time was wasted.
In that time, I could bring the number as much as I spent in putting my mind to copy.
And when I tried to get closer by copying, I was caught in it and because of my reason many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut paths become the reason for copying.
So the copy never benefits.
Copy makes you bad, so do not copy.
You must have heard often and again that do not copy, do not copy.
I am also telling you the same thing again.
And once there is a habit of copying, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
Whatever is your entire creativity, they are used in the ways of copying and if you give the same time on the issues of your office, then perhaps it is not necessary to copy.
The results that will be achieved by the hard work of yourself, the confidence that will increase will be amazing.
This basic belief is wrong, the root of the problem is the same.
If there is an inclusive development, then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to learn to live him too.
Somebody says that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, I will do it later, then it is impossible.
Have you ever imagined that when all this is in front of you, you will come out for two moments and look at the sky and look at the trees and plants, lighten your mind, you will see it again with a freshness and you will come in your rooms and your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a little break, get up and go out, go to the kitchen, find something of your choice, get a biscuit for your choice, then eat and make a little joke.
Whether it is five minutes, but you should break.
You will feel that your work is getting simple.
Everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have an experience.
There is no need to stay in the room to take a deep breath.
You can see that the body will be relaxed at once and the relationship of the body that you don't feel is equally relaxed to the brain organs.
When I hold meetings in the elections, sometimes my voice sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me - how many hours you sleep.
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No, no, he said - This voice that gets worse while speaking at the time of election is related to it.
You will take full sleep only then your voice card will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, you will benefit.
But this does not mean that just stay asleep, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said that now there is no need to wake up and sleep.
So do not do this, otherwise the people of your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheets will come on the day you will not see them, I will see them.
So do not do this.
And that is why I would say that the PDF for prepared and PDF for play, the person who plays, the plays, the skins, the mind, the intellect, the body is a very big medicine to keep him alert.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the exam and I'm sitting in mind.
It may be that my talk of today will also work for you as a relationship.
If possible, do not do it, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So, as I advise the parents of your family not to become a burden, they also apply to me.
To cross every criterion, make the criterion a festival.
Then there will never be a criterion, a criterion.
Take this mantra and move forward.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the 4 largest Coast Guard in the world with all its 126 ships and 62 aircrafts built in the country.
While performing this ideal sentence, the jawans of the Coast Guard are ready day and night in adverse circumstances to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country.
And very few people will know that there are not only men in the Coast Guard in our country, women are also playing their responsibilities equally with shoulder to shoulder.
Our women in the Coast Guard are pilots, work as supervisors, not only this, they also take charge of the overcraft.
It is believed to be an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color gives Basanti Chola - This is the same inspiration.
My best wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious festival of Panchmi.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani also keeps on filling new colors with its imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my mind from last month, he has started reciting the talk of mind in regional languages.
It has got comprehensive approval.
People from far and wide are writing letters.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to join you.
My best wishes.
Talk of mind, December 2016
But you must have seen in newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being conducted, good people are being caught. How is it possible

Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border on the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else
The impact of the country's 1. 25 billion countrymen, in the unique style, it dedicated to the soldiers of the Diwali army, dedicated to the security forces, was expressed on the faces of every soldier.
They looked full of emotions and not only this, the best wishes and messages that the countrymen sent, included the security forces of the country in their happiness, was a wonderful response.
And people just sent messages, not so, they were connected to the mind.
Someone wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made video, that is, every house became a post of armymen.
The work is going on, the contribution of all of you, the feelings of the soldiers of the country will be compiled in this book by your imagination and your feelings towards the security forces of the country.
A soldier of the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, for the soldiers, Holi and Diwali are celebrated on the border, every time they are immersed in the security of the country.
Yeah, yet the house remembers at the time of festivals.
But tell the truth, this time it does not seem
It's not like that the festival is and I'm not home
It felt as if we are celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that this Diwali, the feeling that has awakened among the security forces of our country, should it be limited only on some occasions
I appeal to you that we, in the form of a society, in the form of a nation, in the form of our nature, in any form we should remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million times
Just a while ago, I had come from Jammu and Kashmir to meet all the heads of the village there.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time .
He had come with some things about the development of his village and had come with some demands, but when the round was over, it was natural that the situation of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And with so much love, so openly, these chiefs of the village spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I had urged them to go and focus on the future of these children .
Today I am happy that all these Prime Ministers who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise that they had given me.
Going to the village awakened all the people away
Just a few days ago when the board's team took place, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board examination about 95, fifty percent of Kashmir students took part in the board examination.
Inclusion of students in such large numbers in the board examinations points to the fact that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development for a bright future, through education.
I congratulate the students for this zeal, but my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, their families, their teachers and all the villagers.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked for suggestions from the people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that only one-sided suggestions should be made.
Everyone used to say that talk in detail on 500- and 1000 notes
While addressing the nation's name at 8 pm on 8th November, I had discussed the introduction of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision and presented it before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to be implemented.
And I was also supposed to face many new difficulties in our normal life .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its effect and then we will be able to move towards the normal stage.
The campaign to get rid of those diseases that we have been facing for 70 years cannot be easy
I can understand your difficulties well
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation
Despite a lot of efforts are being made to confuse you, even though sometimes the events that distract the mind, you have well understood this path of truth, you have well accepted this thing of the country's interest.
Five hundred thousand notes and such a big country, a lot of currency, billions and billions of notes and these decisions - the whole world is looking at it very closely, every economist is doing analysis and evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that the 125 crore Indians of India will be able to succeed even after facing difficulties
There may be question marks in the minds of the world
India has only reverence for the 125 crore Indians, it is believed that the 125 crore Indians will continue to fulfill their resolutions.
And our country will come out by penance and shine like gold and the reason for this is the citizen of this country, the reason for this success has also been possible due to you.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks and friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of a variety of tensions, all these people are working very calmly, as a yagna of the country and service, as an attempt to make a great change.
Start in the morning, when the night will be completed, does not even know, but all are doing
And that is why India will succeed in this, it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and the post office are working with such difficulties.
And when it comes to the issue of humanity, they see two steps ahead
Somebody told me that an old man in Khandwa became an accident
Suddenly the need for money
I was glad to know that they would go to their homes and the elderly so that they could help in the treatment.
Such numerous stories appear in TV every day, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
Their power was introduced .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of the 125 crore Indians, the collective mandate of all will make this nation a new strength.
But the evils are spread so much that even today some people do not have the habit of evils .
Even now some people feel that these money for corruption, these black money, these unaccounted money, these benami money and some other way and bring it back to the system.
They're looking for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly , in this too they like to choose the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by talking about greed or temptation, by putting money in their accounts or by doing some work from them.
But, don't play with the poor's life by showering mercy
Do not do anything that the name of the poor comes on the record and afterwards when it is checked, my beloved poor get stuck in trouble due to your sin.
And the benami property has made such a harsh law, which is being implemented in it, how difficult it will be
And the government does not want our countrymen to face any difficulty
A Mr. Ashish of Madhya Pradesh has telephoned me, who has fought against corruption and black money through this five hundred and a thousand, praised me: - Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Gram Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh
It is very commendable that the currency that you have closed for thousands and five hundred notes
Likewise, I have received a phone from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: - Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to the Koppal District of Karnataka from this village of Yelappa Velankar
I want to thank you with my heart, because you had said that good days would come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all these, taught a lesson to black money and corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never come to this good day
I want to thank you for this.
If some things are found through media, people through government sources, then the enthusiasm of working is also very high.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that the common man in my country has a wonderful strength.
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is marriage too.
I came to know that on 17th November, in Surat, there was a marriage that took place with discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter in Surat gave tea to those who came here in marriage and did not feed tea and no food programme, nothing - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage
Baratis also considered him as equal respect
Bharat Maru of Surat and Daksha Parmar of Surat - They are inspiring in themselves that they have contributed to corruption through their marriage, against black money.
I also give my blessings to the newly married Bharat and Daksha and also congratulating the occasion of marriage to this great yagna and turning it into a new opportunity.
Tea-Worker lives and tea-Worker gets weekly money
Now a note of Rs 2000 was found, what did they do
Four neighbouring women gathered and the four bought and paid a note of Rs 2000, so they did not need a small currency because the four bought and decided that they would get the next week, then we will take account of it by sitting
People are looking for their own ways
See how the lives of the village are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality gets 50 of tax hardly
But this time due to this decision of the 8th, all the people ran to submit their old notes
In 47 urban units last year, there was a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees.
You will be surprised to know that it will also be enjoyed - in this week they got Rs 13 thousand crore deposited.
Three-and-a-half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front ,
Now the municipality has 4 times this money, it is natural that the poor settlements will have a gutter system, water will be arranged, Anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples that in which its direct benefits have also started to appear.
Brothers and sisters, Our village, our farmers are a strong axis of the economy of our country.
On one hand, due to this new change in the economy, in the midst of difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I want to specially congratulate the farmers of my country today
Now I was taking the figures of sowing this crop
I was happy, whether wheat or pulses, whether oilseeds or oilseeds or till 20th November, sowing has increased considerably in comparison to last year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has discovered ways
Government has also made several important decisions, in which farmers and villages have been given priority
Even after that, there are difficulties but I am confident that the farmer who is facing every difficulty, natural difficulties and is always standing stunned, he is still standing stunned at this time.
Small traders of our country, they also provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given to such small people by the currency scheme, because these small businesses are done in crores of people and accelerate the trade of billions and billions of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have difficulty due to this decision .
But I have seen that now our small traders are also serving the customers in their own way through technology, through mobile apps, through mobile bank, through credit cards and on the basis of trust.
And I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you also enter the digital world.
You also download the app of banks on your mobile phone
Please keep PSL machine for credit cards too
I invite you to make a cashless society you can contribute immensely to enhancing your business, to create a full banking system on mobile phones and today there are several ways other than notes that we can drive businesses.
There are technological paths, say, there is security and is quick
I would like you to help this campaign to succeed, not only this, you should also lead the change and I am confident that you can lead the change.
I would like to say to the labourer brothers and sisters, you have been very exploited.
There is a salary on paper and when given in hand, then the second is
Sometimes the salary gets full, somebody stands outside, somebody has to pay the cut and the labour force makes this exploit a part of life.
With this new system, we want that your bank has an account, your salary money should be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
And once the money has come to your bank account, you too can buy a small mobile phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as e-boatway. You can also buy money from the same mobile phone to the small shop in the neighborhood.
Therefore, I urge the labourer brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because finally I have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the deprived, for the victims and the benefits of this scheme.
Today I want to talk to young friends especially
We say in the world that India is a country with 65 population, below 35 years of age.
You are young and young people of my country, I know, my decision is liked by you.
I also know you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute a lot to this thing positively .
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
A wonderful opportunity to serve Mother Bharati has come to us and there has been an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My youngsters, can you help me
I'm not going to talk so much.
The more the experience of today's world you have, not the older generation.
The elder brother in your family will not even know and parents, uncles and maternal uncles may not even know.
You know what is the app, what is online banking, you know how online ticket booking happens.
Items are very common for you and you use it .
But today the great work that the country wants to do, our dream is cashless society.
It's right that 100 cashless society is not possible
And I want your physical help, your time, yourself's resolution and you will never disappoint me, I am confident because we all are people who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know how many opportunities are today for cashless society, for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online facility
Wallet's direct meaning is e-Batuva
Several types of cards are available
Cash transfer can also be done by ordinary food phone.
Whether it is washing, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, newspaper sellers, tea sellers, gram sellers, everyone can comfortably use it.
And I have also insisted on making this system more simple
All the banks are engaged on this, are doing
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work
The kind of creative message you give on WhatsApp - slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and joke - I see everything that is the creative power of our younger generation in the midst of challenges, it seems as if it is the characteristic of India that during a time when the Gita was born in the field of war, we are undergoing such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I want your help and you, you, I believe that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You will voluntarily bring this cashless society out of the rounds of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from difficulties and problems - you have to lead it.
Once you will teach people how to use RuPay Card, then the poor will bless you.
If we teach these arrangements to the common man, then he will probably get rid of all the concerns and if this work is taken by all the youngsters of India, I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do these things through your mobile phones, you can do it by going to 10 houses every day, by adding 10 houses everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again, once again with a big request, I tell you that you should take this campaign forward.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead with the campaign of cleanliness.
It seems that the subject of sanitation has spread in their veins and that is why he remembered the work of sanitation even on his father's birth anniversary.
He has written that Harivansh Rai ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil, mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce his introduction through this.
The body of soil, the mind of fun, the life of fun, my introduction to me, his son, Shri Amitabh ji, whose mission of cleanliness is running in his veins, has written to me that he has sent me using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Taan, Swachh Man, Swachh Bharat, my introduction
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai ji
I also thank Mr. Amitabh ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in this way and pursuing the work of sanitation.
My dear countrymen, now your thoughts, your emotions, through your letters, on MyGov, on Narendra ModiApp, keep me connected to you.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but it is going to start immediately after completing it in regional languages.
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that 365 days, some festivals are seen in some corner of the country.
The people who see from far away will ever feel that like Indian life, this is the second name of the festival, and it is also natural.
We have seen the tradition of festivals that have been in India since the Vedas till date, the festivals that have been conveniently transformed, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of external festivals and the change in festivals according to the demand of time and society has also been easily accepted.
But one of these things can be very well seen that this entire journey of India's festivals, its depth, its penetration, its people's penetration, its original mantra is connected to it.
Efforts should be made to expand personality, extend the scope of your limited thinking, from the society to the universe and through these festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have gathered in the festival in a scientific manner.
Today the whole world discusses environment.
Nature-destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival of India is going to embrace the tradition, nature-love, from child to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds or birds, there are festivals that have a sense of responsibilities for everyone.
Nowadays, we celebrate Sunday's holidays, but you must have seen that for centuries we had traditions of celebrating Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, the tradition of celebrating with the universe and science was also developed here.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said, every festival of ours is an educationist, comes with a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya - from darkness to light.
By burning Deepawali, the dark shadow of the society, the dark shadow of the person, the dark shadow of the person, is also a festival of liberation and the same is a festival of bringing light to light by burning Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, let us go to any corner of India, let us go to the rich-se-Amir's house, let us go to the poorest of the poor in the hut, in the festival of Diwali, in every family the campaign of cleanliness is going on.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The poor will have their soil utensils, so the soil utensils also clean such as it has just come to Diwali.
Diwali is also a campaign for cleanliness.
However, the need of the hour is not only to clean up the house, to clean up the entire complex, to clean up the entire area, to clean up the entire village, we have to expand our nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
Deepawali festival is remembered and celebrated in some form in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, the Parliament of that place, the rulers of that place are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
And they have shared that picture with the world and have done it with great pride.
And what is the picture.
16 women MPs from Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and these photographs have become viral.
And all this has been done for Diwali
Just now the Prime Minister of New ealand had come, he told me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light, is also becoming an inspirational festival to bring the world community from darkness to light.
Many firecrackers invite a very big accident in an attempt to make a big voice of tax collecting.
Never remember what things are around, there will be no fire anywhere.
In the days of Deepawali, the news of the accident, the news of fire, the news of mortality, makes great concerns.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their family in large numbers, then there is another crisis in the crisis.
It is not just one day.
He said Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Say Benefits Panchami, and take them to the light festival of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period of time goes on.
Along with this, we also celebrate the festival of Deepawali and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
In the eastern region of India, the festival of Chhath-Puja is a very big festival.
In a way, there is a great festival, it lasts for four days, but it has a specialty - it gives a great message to the society.
But the proverb is that Bhai, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, speak of Chhath-Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you, but at the same time there is more time for me, to thank the people of particularly the countrymen, to express gratitude.
Our army personnel are looting everything for our comfort and peace for the past few months, the events that are taking shape.
This sacrifice, penance, hard work and my heart remains shadowed by the soldiers of the army and the security forces on my emotions.
And one of the same thing was in mind that it was dedicated to Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen to Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But today I want to say by bowing my head, there will be no human being in India, whose hearts have the pride of the army, the pride of the security forces.
The way it has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces, so enthusiastic, your message has emerged as powerful.
Whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, players, cinemas, there will be hardly anybody who has not given it to the soldiers of the country. Have not given the message for the soldiers.
The media also reversed this festival for expressing gratitude to the army and why not do it, be it BSF, RPF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF, IDF
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Riles, Water Army, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all, innumerable.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is a new strength in that memory too.
Efficiency increases in a message and the country has shown tax.
I really express my gratitude to the people of the country.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers have come on this ashtag so many things have come, in a symbolic form.
I have sent a poem by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I am happy, I smile, all this, because you are, I tell you this day, because you are the reason for my independence, you are happy, I sleep comfortably because because I sleep comfortably because you are deployed on the border, you are bowed down to the glass, the mountain ambar and the glass of India, you are headed by mountain ambar and the glass of India.
My dear countrymen, whose mother-in-law is full of army personnel and whose in-laws are also filled with army personnel, one such sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Let us listen, what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign that has been launched on this Deepawali is getting a lot of encouragement to our army brothers.
I'm from an army family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My wather and wather-in-law, both the army offices have lived.
So we are filled with the entire family solidiers and on the border there are many such offices that are getting so good messages and are getting a lot of incentive in the army circle.
And I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also sacrifice a lot.
Thank you. My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every front of life, not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from open defecation, open defecation free.
Earlier, Sikkim province had happened, now Himachal has also happened, on 1st November Kerala is also going to be held.
TBP jawan, Shri Vikas Thakur - he is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village, perhaps somewhere in the village, they reached there and were discussing in the village meeting, making toilets and it was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
This development Thakur is full of patriotism.
And that is why Himachal Pradesh was able to free the open defecation.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youngsters.
I have noticed that in the remote forests of Kerala, where there is no road, after walking all day, it can be difficult to reach that village, such a tribal Panchayat, Idmalakudi, is also difficult to reach.
People never go.
Near him, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets were to be built in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS people, engineering students, all decided to make toilets.
The luggage, bricks, cements, all the stuff that were to be taken to make toilets, all these youngsters picked up on their shoulders and went to the forests on foot all day long.
Work is going on at a very fast pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way they have taken this task, the entire state, I am confident that very soon the kerosene will be free.
How big changes will come, theft will also stop, the environment will also benefit, our foreign exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yeah, it will be difficult, the middlemen will have, the dishonest will have.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should be called the country even today, how to go, decides the standard for it.
Based on this standard, you decide.
It is time that we have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country now.
To get rid of troubles, we will have to take one step after one.
Why not our old thinking should be anything, but society must be freed from the distinction of son-daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls and toilets for children in schools.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination-free India.
Immunization is done by the government, but even then lakhs of children leave vaccination and become victims of illness.
A campaign of Mission Indradhanush vaccination, which is also engaged in accumulating the missing children, which enables children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, the poor mothers and the smoke of 400 cigarettes in a day by cooking food on the stove of wood, what will happen to her health
The effort is to give 5 crore families a smoke-free life, we are moving towards success.
Small businessman, small businessman, vegetable seller, milk seller, barber shopkeeper, was stuck in the interest of moneylenders - it was stuck.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, this is a successful campaign for liberation of interested people.
Direct deposits to the banks through Aadhaar and the beneficiaries get money directly.
This is an opportunity to get rid of middlemen in the lives of common man.
There is a campaign in which not just reforms and changes, but the path from problem to liberation is being ensured and is happening.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October, the great men of this country, the unity of India who made the mantra of their lives, showed them that this is the festival of birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman of Punjab, his pain, touched me also: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know, Sardar Patel ji's birth anniversary on 31st.
And as we all know how events took place in the country after their murder.
Sir, I wanted to say that we can stop those events which are unfortunate.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, the Bhagirath work of uniting the country was done by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring Azad Hindustan under one flag, such a great man who has done such a great Bhagirath work, he salutes the great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, due to his priority to unity struggled for unity, many were also victims of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, one page of oppression and history pains all of us.
However, in the midst of these crisiss, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the strength of this country.
We also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency, save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us Ek Bharat, we are all responsible for making Shreshtha Bharat.
The original mantra of unity makes the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life started with the struggle of farmers.
The sons of the farmer were.
Sardar Saheb played a very important role in bringing the freedom movement to the farmers.
It was Sardar Saheb's successful effort to make the freedom movement strong in the village and his organization was the result of power and skills.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not like that, he was also a person of the structure.
Today sometimes we listen to the name of Amul.
Today people are familiar with every product of Amul.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb had a divine vision that he had imagined the unity of co-operative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima in this series of Diwali is also a festival of light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and teachings are still a guide for the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and Sarbat Da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the original mantra of peace, unity and goodwill.
Be it discrimination, superstition, mischief, the campaign to get rid of the society was only in every matter of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were at the peak of its deformity, the untouchable, caste system, high and low, then Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate.
Let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who inspires us to leave discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, if we want to go ahead with this mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, then who can be a better guide than Guru Nanak Dev.
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev and this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, in the name of the soldiers of the country, this Diwali and on this Diwali, my best wishes to you all.
Your dreams, your resolutions will be successful in every way.
I extend my best wishes to all of you that your life becomes a life of happiness and peace.
Thank you very much.
In the past, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I would like to tell the countrymen the same thing today and I would like to repeat what I had said on that day.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We are nazzy on our army.
I want to talk specially to the citizens of Kashmir today.
Citizens of Kashmir have started to understand the anti-national forces well.
And as they have started to understand the truth, they have separated themselves from such elements and walked on the path of peace.
Every parents wish that the school-college work completely as soon as possible.
Farmers also feel that the crops and fruits that have been prepared for them should reach the market across India.
Economic business also runs properly.
And for the past few days, the business has started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are also a way to solve our problems, our progress is also a way of development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will meet and find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
Security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of governance.
Government has to take some steps to make laws and orders.
Sometimes people who think differently from what we think, they also have new ideas.
I have the opportunity to know a lot in social media these days.
Every corner of India gives an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of every kind of people and it promotes the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of class 11 had a different kind of idea in front of me.
He wrote that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very disturbed.
But there was no way to do and what a small student like me could do.
So I came to mind how I should also work for the country's interest.
And I resolved that I would study 3 hours more every day.
I can work in the country, I will become such a worthy citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, it is a matter of happiness for me that at such a young age you can think healthyly in this atmosphere of resentment.
But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very best way.
And he inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan Mantra.
There is another way to express patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns for every citizen, it was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri Ji.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the freedom movement, when the movement was intensified and there was a need for a stop in the movement, he used to use that intensity of the movement to inspire the creative work in the society.
If all of us are responsible for the army, the people sitting in the government have their duties and we are the people of the country, every citizen, with the patriotism of this patriotism, we also have some creative contribution, then the country will certainly cross new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on the Narendra ModiApp that the athletes that had gone to Paralimpics have created history and their performance is the victory of human spirit.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan also wrote on the Narendra ModiApp that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in the matter of Mann Ki Baat.
You are not two, every person in the country has got an emotional attachment towards our sportspersons in Paralimpics.
Perhaps this paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the vision of humanity, to look at Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our victorious sister Deepa Malik.
When he got the medal, he said that with this medal I have defeated disability only.
This sentence has a great strength.
This time, 19 athletes, including 3 women from our country, participated in Paralimpics.
In comparison to the rest of the sports, when Divyang plays, physical capabilities, sports skills, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be happy to know that our players have won 4 medals while performing the best so far - 2 Gold, 1 Silver, 1 Bronze medal.
Brother Devendra Jhajhariya, who received the Gold Medal, brought the gold medal again and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not disabled from birth.
He had to lose one of his hands due to the imposition of electricity.
Think of the people who get the first Gold Medal at the age of 23 and get the second Gold Medal at the age of 35, how big they would have done in their lives.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won the gold medal in High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
Poverty also did not come under their determination.
Neither are they residents of big cities nor are they from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, he gave medals to the country with the power of resolution.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, he has been associated with his name for hoisting many types of Vijayapatakas.
Varun C. Bhati won the bronze medal in a high jump.
These medals have done a very big job to see the medals of Paralimpics and their medals in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our divyang brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities have been awakened, but the attitude of seeing these disabled people has also changed.
Very few people will know how these Divyangjans have done their valour in this year's paralympics.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition at the same place.
Anyone can think that the record of general lympics has been broken and broken by the people with disabilities.
This time it has happened.
Abdellati Baka of Algeria made a new record in a race of 1. 7 seconds, in a race of 1500 metres, in a race of 1500 metres, in a record made by the recipient of the Gold Medal.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth number of persons with disabilities who did not get any medal as a driver was run in less time than the person who got gold medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of making a smooth plan for the Paralimpics as well as for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had many wonderful experiences in Navsari in Gujarat.
He also told me some portions, and I presented them in front of the people, so people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book and collected success stories of the lives of some persons with disabilities.
There were big inspirational events.
The Government of India has recorded a world record on the land of Navsari, which I believe is important.
Within eight hours, six hundred persons with disabilities who could not hear were successfully used to feed machines.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for the countrymen to have a three-three World Record by Divyangs in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should become a duty, an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt should be created.
Now when two years are taking place on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1.
And I had said that one step towards Swachhata and today we all can say that everyone has tried to move one step ahead.
Meaning that the country has moved forward towards 100 million steps, cleanliness.
And that is why everybody, whether it is a common citizen, whether it is a government office or a road, be it a bus stand or rail, be it a school or college, be it a religious place, be it a hospital, be it a small effort, be it a small effort, be it a common citizen, be it a government office or a road, be it a railway or a railway, be it a religious place or a college or be it a religious place, be it a hospital or adolescents, be it the poor, the farmer women, all are contributing to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has become good, the efforts have become plenty, and we will succeed, this belief has also been created.
So far, about two and a half crore toilets have been constructed and in the coming one year, more than one and a half crore toilets have been constructed.
I had just gone to Gujarat, then the officials told me that Porbandar, which is the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the entire goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations and best wishes to those who are trying to do this work and I urge the countrymen that we have to free the country from this problem for the respect of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children and we should move forward by taking a resolution.
Especially I want to present a plan for young friends who use technology nowadays.
Everybody has the right to know what the cleanliness mission is in your city and for this, the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know, Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the condition of construction of toilets in your city by phone, but also apply for making toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor such young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat ellows.
This cleanliness campaign is not even limited to rituals.
Cleanliness becomes a habit, it is not enough.
In today's era, health connects with cleanliness, along with cleanliness, Revenue Model is also essential.
Waste to Health also needs to be a part of it and that is why we have to move forward with the Swachhta Mission as well as towards Waste to Compost.
Fertilizers have asked the companies to buy the compost which is ready from the waste.
Those farmers who want to go to organic farming should provide these things to them.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, mention the health of the earth, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, if they need such fertilizer in some quantity then they should be provided.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as a brand ambassador.
It's like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers from all over the country, Mayor of the metropolitan cities and commissioners - all these are going to contemplate only and only hygiene.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All the topics are going to be discussed.
And I am seeing that new news continues to come for cleanliness.
One day I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and launched a Jagran campaign to build toilets.
He worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh, a team swimming in the Ganga from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar and gave a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also created a year-long calendar by its departments.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for 15 days especially.
In the coming month of October 1st to 15th, drinking water and sanitation department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department - these three are going to work by making a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of the month of October, 16th October to 31st October, 3rd and Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries.
My citizens also request that if you are related to the work done by these departments then you should also join.
You must have seen that these days a survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on.
Once again, after surveying 73 cities, what is the situation of cleanliness, it was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of more than one lakh populations who are close to 500 and that is why every city creates a belief that let us stay behind, now the next time we will do something better.
There is an atmosphere of competition for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us should contribute to this campaign as much as possible.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
Swachh Bharat Mission is taking 2 years.
I keep insisting on buying something from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time also I urge every family to have some khadi things so that the water given by Diwali in the poor's house can be burnt.
On October 2, while Sunday is, can we connect somewhere in cleanliness as a citizen
You should connect yourself in the work of sanitation for 2 hours, 4 hours, and I would like to tell you that one photograph of the sanitation campaign you should share me on the Narendra ModiApp.
If there is video, share video.
See, with the efforts of the people across the country, this movement will get a new strength and a new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a joy in giving it in life and no one should recognise it or not.
It is their campaign to collect food items, clothes and taxes to the needy people.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and used to donate the old toys of the families and those toys used to come to visit the poor settlements of Anganwadi.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to the youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is the 25th September, today is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji and the centenary year of his birth is starting from today.
The principle of Sarvajan Hitay-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is their contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also talked about the welfare of the last person.
How to get the fruit of development to the poorest of the poor
He had presented the entire economic agenda to every farm, water to every field, in two words.
The country celebrated their birth centenary as a poor welfare year.
The focus of the society, the governments, the attention of everyone, the benefits of development should be given to the poor and only then can we liberate the country from poverty.
He is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I respectfully salute the inspirational man of all of us, the rich revered Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, I started talking about Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
It was my authentic endeavour that the matter of mind - it should not be a program to praise the government works.
How the common man of this country inspires me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I thank all the audience for the way you have praised Mann Ki Baat, the way you have blessed Sanvara, the way you have blessed.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that he not only broadcasted these things to me, but also tried his best to deliver it to all languages.
I am also grateful to the people of the country who wrote letters after the Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions, knocked the doors of the government, highlighted the deficiencies of the government and Akashwani gave a platform to solve the problems by inviting the people of the government by making special programmes on such letters.
So the talk of mind is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, but a new opportunity for social change has become.
What can be the cause of greater satisfaction for anyone and therefore I thank everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navaratri and Durga-Puja, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different environment takes place in the entire country.
This is a festival of power humility and unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga-Puja, how should it be the festival of worship of power, the worship of unity of society
How is the festival connecting the people
And that is the sadhana of true power and only then we can celebrate the victory of the victory by doing it.
Come on, let's seek power, let's go with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar is the birth anniversary of Hockey magician Dhyan Chand ji on August 29.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and on this occasion I would like to remind all of you of his contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in getting the gold medal of Hockey Hockey to India in the Limpic Games.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had asked Dhyan Chand ji - we scores goals like runs, Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hit meditation Chand ji's head.
At that time there was only 10 minutes left to end the match.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time comes for Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions on MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
The common citizen's attachment to the Rio Impics, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to say something about it, I am seeing it a very positive thing.
Outside cricket, there is so much love for Indian citizens and sports, so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this also became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Shriman Ajit Singh has written on Narendra ModiApp, Please speak about the education of daughters in Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports because he has made the country proud by winning a medal in Rio Limpics.
Any Mr. Sachin writes that you have a request to mention the Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of this time.
The medal we got, the daughters gave it.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anyone in any way.
It seems as if the daughters of all India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do even better in Lympic.
He has written that Honble Modi Sir, first of all congratulated for the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to this whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to make a long journey in sports.
Our parents still insist on studying and academics.
In the society, the game is still considered to be a waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And no one can do this work well with you.
Any such Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the Narendra ModiApp that there is a need to focus on entrepreneurship activities in the matter of Mann Ki Baat, especially by taking children and youth to sports.
In a way thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
It can not be ruled out that we could not perform according to our hope.
In some cases it happened that those who used to perform in India, those who used to perform in the sports here could not reach there, even there and only two medals have been received in the medal table.
But it is also true that even after not getting the medal, if you look carefully, for the first time in many topics, the players of India have shown a very good job.
Now see, in the shooting, our innovative Bindra ji stayed at fourth place and he missed the medal at a very small distance.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also wondered that he remained at fourth place and he missed the medal due to a very little difference.
But how can we forget this thing that she is the first Indian daughter to quote for lympic and for lympic final.
Something similar happened in tennis with the pair of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
We have performed well this time in athletics.
After PT Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar has qualifyed for trackfield zones.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women's hockey team reached Lympic.
Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the quarter-final in Boeing, but Brone could not be found.
Many players, such as Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performance is good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we will continue to do the same thing, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Government of India will go into the depth of this house and will study what practices are being done in the world.
We will make a roadmap for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028 - With a far-reaching thinking, we have to plan.
I also urge the state governments to make such committees and what can we do in the sports world, what can our state do, what can the state choose one sports, two sports
And I urge every citizen in India to send suggestions to me on the Narendra ModiApp.
Write to the government, discuss the association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers' Day.
I also learned a lot from these small boys.
For me, there was a Teachers' Day on 5th September and for me, Education Day was also there.
But this time I have to go for the G-20 Summit, so I was convinced that today in the matter of Mann Ki Baat, I will express my feelings and feelings.
As much as the mother's place in life, the same is the place of the teacher.
And we have seen such teachers who have more concern than themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after the Rio Impics, there is a discussion of Pullela Gopichand ji all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what happens to a good teacher.
Today I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher in addition to a player.
And on Teachers' Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The teacher's contribution to all of us is always felt.
5th September is the birth day of former President of India, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates him as Teacher Day.
He reached any place in life, but he always tried to live himself as a teacher.
I also think sometimes, I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our ero in our small village.
But today I can say with happiness that one of my teachers - now they are 90 years old - even today I have a letter to them every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised that even today, he writes with such beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad, because of this, whenever I see a good letter of someone, I am very much respected in my mind.
You have a photograph with your teacher on the Narendra ModiApp, some incident with your teacher, some motivation from your teacher, you must share.
Look, seeing the contribution of teachers in the country with the eyes of the students, it is also very valuable in itself.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh festival is going to come in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator and we all want our country, our society, our family, every person and his life to be integrated.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival - this is the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national Jagran and made it a festival of social rituals.
And through the Public Ganesh Festival, there should be a big discussion on the questions that touch the society and life and the creation of programmes should be such that the society gets a new energy and a new momentum.
Even today, not just Maharashtra but in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started taking place.
All the youngsters also make a lot of preparations to do this, there is a lot of enthusiasm.
And some people have still tried their best to follow the spirit of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
They have discussions on public subjects, essay competitions, Rangoli competitions.
In his philosophy, he also highlights the issues that touch the society in a artistic manner.
In a way, a big campaign of public education runs through the public Ganesh festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth-siddhi right.
Suraj is our priority, can we not send a message from the public Ganesh festival about this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that festival is the power of society.
The festival fills a new life in the life of a person and a society.
Life is impossible without the festival, but it has to be modified according to the demand of time.
This time I have seen that many people have specially written a lot on Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja - those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
He has urged the people not to use the idols of Ganesh ji made of Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of the village pond
POP statues are not favorable for the environment.
They have expressed a lot of pain, others have also done.
I also pray to all of you, why do not we come back to that old tradition by using the soil, the idols of Ganesh and Durga.
The protection of the environment, the protection of our rivers and ponds, the protection of these small creatures of water from pollution in it is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a disintegrator.
So we should not make such Ganesh ji, who create a dissolution.
I don't know how you will take these things in my form.
Many such institutions and individuals work very hard for the genesis of soil.
Co-friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we decide that the statues that our old families used to make will also get employment and if they are made of ponds or river soil, then they will get it again and then the environment will also be protected.
I extend my best wishes to you all for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa will be awarded the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had put her whole life for the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served the poor people of India throughout his life, gets a saint's degree.
An official delegation led by the Government of India, our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there on behalf of 1. 25 billion Indians in the event that will take place on 4th September.
From the saints, from the sages, from the saints and the great men, we get to learn something or the other.
We will continue to find something or the other, will continue to learn and will continue to do something good.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a Jan Andolan, there is a big change.
Jan Shakti is considered as God's form.
The Government of India, in collaboration with five State Governments, has made a successful effort to connect the people for clean Ganga, for cleaning Ganga.
On 20th of this month, people were invited to Allahabad who were heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women were also there.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganga coast took oath in the testimony of Mother Ganga that they will immediately stop the tradition of going to the open in their villages of the Ganges coast, run a campaign to build toilets and the village will contribute completely in Ganga cleaning that the village will not allow the Ganga to be dirty.
I would like to come to Allahabad for this resolution, some people came from Uttarakhand, some people came from Uttar Pradesh, some people came from Bihar, some people came from Jharkhand, some people came from West Bengal, I would like to congratulate them for this work.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and congratulate those Ministers who have realised this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all those 5 states that they took an important step in cleaning the Ganga by connecting the Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and I have a special respect for those who imagine it.
On July 15, more students from more than seventeen hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Somebody wrote in English, someone wrote in Hindi, someone wrote in Chhattisgarh, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children of seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And this was so impressed that when the school came on the second day after getting the letter, the parents caught a letter to the teacher and their parents had promised that they would make a toilet till the final date.
Congratulations to those students who have made these efforts and special congratulations to those parents who have decided to make toilets by taking their child's letter seriously.
This is what inspires us.
Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years of age in this district of Koppal district of Karnataka - this daughter made Satyagraha against her family.
They say that they had left the food and that too was not to ask for anything for themselves, not to bring good clothes, not to eat sweets, the insistence of daughter Mallamma was that there should be toilets in our house.
Now there was no economic condition of the family, the daughter was stuck on Jid, she was not ready to leave her Satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had done a satyagraha for the toilet, then also look at the specialty of Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village that he waited for eighteen thousand rupees and made more toilets within a week.
See the strength of this daughter Mallamma's life and see the head of a village like Mohammad Shafi.
How the paths are opened to solve the problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become a dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a resolution.
Some Indians have made it their own.
But everyone is associated with it in some form or the other, everyone is contributing to it.
He will have a competition and those who will win on the day of 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can also make a film from your mobile phone camera.
Let's go ahead, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, to facilitate our relations, to keep our relations alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President Honble Pranab Mukherjee launched a new program in Kolkata, the AIR friendly channel.
Now many people will feel that should the President inaugurate a radio channel
But this is not the channel of common radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
All India Radio Friendship and Bangladesh wireless, they will share content and Bangladeshi people will enjoy Akashwani on both sides.
All India Radio has a great contribution to the people's contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for the fact that they are associated with us for this work.
I also congratulate All India Radio friends that they are also giving their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of the Prime Minister, but finally I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy, inspire new inspirations and that is what inspires the people of India to do something.
In the past, I got a letter, touched my mind.
A 84-year-old mother, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If he had not forbidden me in his letter that never declaring my name, then it was my mind that today I would talk to you by giving him the name and he wrote that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy, I had left the gas subsidy and later I had forgotten it.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padmashree.
Friends, You will know that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives will give them a letter.
My effort is to write letters to more than one crore people.
My letter came to this mother under the same scheme and he wrote to me that you are doing a good job.
Your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher, in a few years my age will be 90 years, I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50 thousand so that you can work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine that as a normal teacher, the mother who passes on retired pension, when you give 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the smoke of stove and gas connection.
The question is not about 50 thousand rupees, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes my trust and strength for the future of the country.
And he did not write to me as the Prime Minister, he wrote a simple letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I salute that mother and salute the mothers of India who are always doing something to do good to somebody.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled due to famine last year, but this August month was constantly filled with the difficulties of floods.
There were frequent floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments, the central governments, the units of the local Swaraj organisation, the social institutions, the citizens, have made every effort to do as much as they can.
But in the midst of the news of these floods, there were reports that needed to be remembered.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can you get
This year's August month will be remembered.
In August 2016, all the parties, who have strong political opposition, who have not left a single chance against each other, and nearly 90 parties across the country, a lot of parties in Parliament, all the parties, together passed the GST law.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And if all the parties go together in one direction then this is an example of how big work is done.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, in relation to the situation of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with a tone.
He also gave a message to the world, gave a message to separatist elements and also expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
And we all believe that hundred and fifty crore people of the country, from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, the opinion is that if anyone knows in Kashmir, whether it is of a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is ours, it is ours.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking these small children forward, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children too.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is filled with diversity.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, we all have the responsibility to strengthen the unity, expose more and more and only then the country can make its bright future.
I believe in the power of hundred and fifty crore countrymen.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi this morning and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will color every young man with enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days the world's largest sports are going to be Mahakumbh.
Rio is going to echo our ears again and again.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but the work of encouraging those players and those players who have gone to play in Rio is also of 1.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a very good event run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khelo.
In the coming days, wherever we are, we should do something to encourage our players.
Why not be so much interested in eating, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this work from you too.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to become a postman to deliver your message to these players.
If there are no research and innovations, then like the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to win with the trust of old technology without research and innovation, then we will become out of time in the changing ages in the world and therefore in the new generation we have taken several steps for research and innovation towards science and technology.
And so I say - let us innovate to innovate and when I let us use to innovate, then my AI
If we want to prepare NET Generation Innovators then our children will have to be linked to it and that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Cab.
10 lakh rupees will be given to the schools wherever there will be such tinkering centres, and 10 lakh rupees will also be given for maintenance during five years.
If we have strong and prosperous Incubation Centres, we have an arrangement for innovation, start-ups, to use it, to bring it to one position.
Similarly, India is battling many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find a technological solution.
We have called for an Atal Grand Hallenges to the younger generation of the country that you see the problem, find ways of technology for solutions, research and innovation.
The Government of India wants to promote the technology discovered for solving our problems by giving special awards.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about the famine and these days the rain is also enjoying, the news of the floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are working together to help the flood victims, shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
In spite of some difficulties due to rain, every mind, every human mind gets blurred because our entire economic activity has rains and cultivation.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we remain regretted throughout our life.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little hygiene, be a little cautious and try to stay safe, pay special attention to the children and not only this kind of disease occurs in the poor settlement but also in the case of engue.
Engue comes first in a pleasant and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen the advertisation on T, but sometimes we are slightly indifferent to the aware action on it.
Governments, hospitals and doctors - they will do their jobs, but we should not enter the engue in our households, in our area, in our family and do not have any illness due to water, be cautious for this, I will pray to you.
I want to attract your attention to another trouble, dear countrymen.
Life has become so complicated and has become such a race that sometimes we don't have time to think for ourselves.
If you are sick then you feel sick, get alright quickly and that's why you put any antibiotic in the body.
Immediately it gets rid of the disease but my dear countrymen, these ways of taking antibiotics can create a serious crisis.
You may be relieved for a moment, but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course of the day the doctor has asked to take.
The bacteria that spread TB and malaria are bringing changes in itself at a rapid pace that medicines do not have any effect.
It is called antibiotic resistance in medical language and therefore it is equally important to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When the matter of health has come out, I want to add one more thing.
Sometimes the concerns of the mothers who are in pregnancy in our country are very tortured.
In our country, about 3 crore women have pregnancy every year, but some mothers die during pregnancy, sometimes mother dies, sometimes child dies, sometimes both child and mother die.
It is fine that in the last decade, there has been a reduction in the rate of untimely death of the mother, but still, even today, the life of pregnant mothers is not able to save a large amount.
During or after pregnancy, deficiency of blood, delivery related infections, high BP - When does not know which problem destroy his life
Keeping in mind these things, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be examined free of cost at the government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I have specially told Gynaecology that you cannot provide these services free of cost for poor mothers on the 9th of a month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not put twelve days in a year for the poor
I'm sure you'll join.
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Lord Krishna also discusses the tree in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, worrying about the tree in the battlefield also means how much it will be, we can guess.
Lord Krishna says in the Gita - Ashwatth: Sarvavrikshana i.e. in all the trees I am Pipal.
Shukracharya policy states - Nasti original medicines - There is no such vegetation, which has no medicinal properties.
The tree who donates the tree gives the wire in the world like the child.
Therefore, parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow their children equally.
Our scriptures - Gita, Venus policy, discipline of Mahabharata - but in today's generation there are some people who live these ideals.
A few days ago, I came to my notice of an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, who touched my mind.
It is said in the discipline festival of Mahabharata that the tree also fulfills the responsibilities of children in the world, Sonal has taken the initiative to fulfill the wishes of not only his parents but also the desires of the society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junar taluka, Pune in Maharashtra, married his granddaughter Sonal in a big motivational manner.
Such a scene that touched the mind was in that picture.
The idea of Sonal, which is a agriculture graduate itself, came to him and offered mango plants in marriage, see how excellent the love of nature appeared.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of nature love, I convey my best wishes to Sonal and Mr. Mahatra ji for this innovative effort.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there used to be a large number of pilgrims in the temple of Amba ji in the month of Bhadra. Once a social worker organization decided that those who would come to the temple will plant them in the prasad and ask them to see that this is the prasad of Mother ji, this plant will be made big by going to his village and will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we ruin our land by putting fences on the banks of our fields, why not we cultivate timber instead of that fence.
Today, to make India a house, to build a city, we have to bring a timber of billions of dollars from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the edge of our farms, which come to work at the edge of the units and houses, then after fifteen-twenty years you can also sell it by cutting it off from the permit of the government and they can also become a new source of income and avoid importing India.
In the past, many states have run a lot of campaign using this weather, the Government of India has also passed an AMPA law, due to which more than 40 thousand crore states are going to go to plantation.
I have been told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore plants.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert-Bhoomi - such a big forest festival and has resolved to plant 25 lakh plants.
In Rajasthan, twenty five lakh plants are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big they have taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percentage by Twenty Twenty-Nine (2029).
There is also a very bright tradition of the Forest Festival in Gujarat.
This year, Gujarat has taken up several projects like Amra Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest, in the form of One Festival and launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I am unable to mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign trip then there is a diplomacy, there is talk of trade, there are discussions about security, there are many Mothers - all this is to happen.
But for me the journey of South Africa was in a way a pilgrimage.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
In the world, non-violence, love, forgiveness - when these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoeni Settlement, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
I was also fortunate to have got the privilege of the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train in which Mohandas was set up to make Mahatma Gandhi.
But what I want to tell, I got the opportunity to meet such dignitaries who had spent their youth for equality, for equal opportunities and for the society.
He fought with Nelson Mandela on shoulder to shoulder. For twenty-twenty-two years he had spent his life with Nelson Mandela.
In a way he had sacrificed his full youth and I was fortunate to visit these great personalities - Shriman Ahmed Kathrada, Shriman Lalu Cheeba, Shriman George Bios, Ronnie Casrills, close associates of Nelson Mandela.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were ready to live for those who lived among them.
On their faces, even after doing such a big penance, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duties - the symptoms of the duties in the Gita, and not the symptoms of the duties, it appeared to be absolutely literate.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no bigger mantra for any society and government.
Equality and mood, these are the only ways that lead us to a bright future.
Children want a good future.
The priorities will be different but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equality, equality and mood.
Let us be proud of these Indians who have also shown the basic mantras of our life in South Africa.
Being a woman, I am very regrettable to her family.
And as technology is doing a big roll in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
You must have been confused sometimes and they write to you in such a good way, as if it seems, it is the right letter.
Any duty sends by making a letter pad, your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a new method of fraud, this is a digital fraud.
I understand that it should be avoided, be cautious and if such false things come, then we should share our friends and make them aware a little.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought a good thing to me, you must have done all the experiences, but perhaps you would not have seen so seriously, but I feel that there is a need to see.
My dear countrymen, the session of Parliament is going on these days and during the session of Parliament, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Moreover, they collected the plastic bottles or oils that were lying in the same waste and collected in the village by exploring them and filling them with soil and planting them and making vertical gardens.
And by making this vertical garden in plastic bottles towards the railway station, it has given it a new form in a way.
If you will ever go to Aligarh, then see the station.
Nowadays I have received these news from several railway stations of India and local people are presenting their area on the walls of the railway station through their art.
A newness is feeling.
This is an example of what change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those who work in this way in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with you, you also have festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples, in the shrines and you will also be associated with the festival outside the house.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is a special festival here.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan this year, can not you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country
Think, give such a gift to the sister, who really protects her in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country, who has been born in India.
75 years of uit Hind and 70 years of India's independence can inspire us, new zeals can be awakened, a pledge to do something for the country.
The whole country will be coloured with the color of the freedom fighters and once again feel the fragrance of freedom.
This environment makes us all and the festival of independence - this is not a government program, it should be of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you will also do something good related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Send his picture on the Narendra Modi App.
Make an atmosphere in the country.
Dear countrymen, on 15th August, I get a privilege to talk to the country with the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your talk as strong as the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come in your mind, which feels that as your representative, as your principal servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort, you must write to me.
Whatever is spoken from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of hundred and fifty million countrymen.
I invite you, let us remember the virtues of the freedom fighters and remember the great men who have spent their lives for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
My greetings to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, greetings.
I am also grateful to Akashwani that he has made a successful effort to present this Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8.
And I am also happy that those who listen to me later bring their feelings to me through letters, telephones, through MyGov website, through Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
How active the government should be in public interest, how primary the work of public interest should be, this interaction with you is very useful for these things.
I hope you will surely emphasize how democracy goes with public participation by becoming more active.
The heat is increasing.
Nearly the maximum part of the country is feeling the heat of heat.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way mankind destroyed nature and paved the way for its destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, there is concern.
This time United Nations has put it on the topic of the zero Tolerance for Civil Life Trade on World Environment Day.
It will be discussed, but we also have to discuss trees and plants, discuss water, how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen that in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - in the lap of the Himalayas, in the jungles the fire took place
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - there is a tradition like the government, I could have a meeting of all drought-affected states, but I did not do this.
What to say to the states, listen to them closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money was spent from the Government of India and how many money was spent - it does not matter closely.
It was also surprising for the officials of our Government of India that many states have made very good efforts, to deal with the situation of water, environment, to deal with the situation of drought, to the animals, to the affected human beings and in a way, to every corner of the country, to the government of any party, it was realized that this problem, to deal with the situation of a long term, to deal with the situation of the environment, to deal with the situation of drought, to the cause of sustainable treatment.
In a way, it was also a learning experience for me and I have told my Policy Commission that there should be some work on the best practices that they should be taken in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, have utilised technologies.
I would like to further convey the special success of the States by the NITI Aayog to us and the States.
Public participation is the basis of a great success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some prasad and a bit of prasad falls, then there is annoyance in the mind.
Take him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also a prasad of God.
If a drop is also ruined, then we should suffer.
And that is why water conservation is equally important, water conservation is equally important and that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, minimum water crops.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, somebody is using drip-irrigation, somebody is using sprinkler.
When I sat with the states, some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy and rice cultivation and due to this, their yields have also increased, water has also been saved and wages have also decreased.
When I heard from these states, there are many states that have taken big targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have worked a lot in drip-irrigation and they are trying to connect two-two-three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign goes on in all the states, then farming will also benefit a lot, water will also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology in the Neeru Pragati Mission, to bring about ground water recharge.
In the mass movement that Maharashtra has created, people are also sweating, they are also giving money.
I feel that this movement will actually work a lot to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh Balram Talab Yojana - Nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small statistics
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are more older bavadis, have been launched a big campaign to revive them as water temples.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister's Water Suspension Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas where water is difficult.
He has launched a massive campaign of check dam.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have started a campaign to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we should decide that even a drop of water will not be wasted.
And this doesn ' t mean just a matter of farmers .
This village, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor are connected to everyone. And that is why the rainy season is coming, the water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali then also enjoy how much water we saved, how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How precious is this treasure given by God
The media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope the media should guide people in the direction of saving water, run the campaign and the media should also become a participant for the everlasting liberation of water crisis.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make transparent India.
If we have to reach many systems equally from one corner to the other corner of India, then our old habits will also have to change a little.
Today, I would like to touch a subject on which if you help me, we can successfully move forward in that direction.
If you want salt, then give so much vegetable in exchange.
Business used to run from the barter system.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving forward towards cashless society.
We can also get Rs.
You can also buy things, even pay the bill.
And this will never raise the question of theft of a butterfly from the pocket.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts, automatic accounts will remain.
The beginning will look a little difficult, but once the habit will take place, then this system will become simple.
And this is the possibility that the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country that we launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana these days have been opened.
So, in coordination with Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM), JAM, we can move forward towards this cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan-Han account.
In the coming days, these cards are going to be used in terms of credit and debit.
There is no need to take money out of the pocket, count it.
There is no need to roam along with it.
Whatever initiatives the Government of India has taken, how to make payments through a PSU
It will be very easy to transact money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of happiness that NP.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your door.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and we have a habit, then we will not need this currency, notes will not be required, money will not be required, business will run on its own and due to this there will be a transparency.
See, once we start, we will move forward very easily.
Twenty years ago, who thought that so many mobile will be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now they can not stay without him.
This cashless society may take the same form but it will be better if it happens in a short time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of lympics come and whenever the games start, then we sit in the sir pot, how far we stayed behind in the Gold Medal, we did not get the silver, we did not run with bronze.
Encouraging and encouraging our sportspersons who are going for Rio lympics, everyone has in their own way.
Write a song, make a cartoon, give a message of good wishes, encourage a game, but the whole country should make a very positive environment for our players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a big strength in itself, when the player feels that the 125 crore Indians are standing with him, then he gets enthusiastic.
And these days I have seen that an atmosphere of football has started to appear across the country.
Many people are making their teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Many people may not have played but thousands of youngsters of the country have such an interest in the game, it was a pleasant experience for me in itself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India but I have seen so much attachment to the football that indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So the eligible characters of choice for Rio lympics, we have created an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm for all our players in the coming days.
Do not let everything win and lose by the test.
With sportsman spirit, India has made its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm and zeal for our sports friends.
New results have been coming from somewhere for the last eight-ten days.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard throughout the year, who have given fams, 10th, 12th, one after the other, the result has started coming.
It has become clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to tell those who have not succeeded once again that there is a lot to do in life.
If the results have not come according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
Should live with faith, be ahead of faith.
But a big new kind of question has come to me and I have never thought about this subject anyway.
But I was surprised that everybody in the house told me the same thing. Hey, four marks would be more than 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89.33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, for four marks, your 90 percent left.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
Wasn't that good what I did
Did I get something less
I don't know, I feel a burden on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that perhaps this pain will be of millions and millions of students like you, because there has been an atmosphere that to find dissatisfaction with it rather than satisfaction with what has happened. This is the second form of negativeness.
We can never take society towards satisfaction by finding dissatisfaction from everything.
It would have been good for your family, your colleagues and friends to appreciate your 89.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, almost like this.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I do not remember the poem completely, but I had read a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the vanvas of life.
I wish, on the picture of my pain, a single spectator had also shed tears.
This was the words of poetry, I do not remember it now, but if there is a poem long ago, but this was the feeling.
You have a burden to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, listen, but stay on your point and try to do something better.
But you will not be able to satisfy what you got, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of big success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success does not make the stairs of success, it becomes a guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this more than the neighbours and parents and companions that you do not impose your expectations with your children.
And Friends, Is that life sometimes failing
Those who cannot bring good marks in the Ceam, they go ahead in sports, they go ahead in music, they go ahead in artwork, they go ahead in business.
God has given everybody a wonderful mode.
Just recognise the power within yourself, emphasize it, you will go ahead.
And this happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santur.
There was a time when the Santur instrument was connected to the Lock Music in the valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who put him in hand and today made an important instrument in the world.
Shahnai - Shahnai was in a limited place in the entire area of our music.
Most of the kings and kings used to have their place on the gate of the courts.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan handled Shahnai, today became the best instrument in the world, he has become an identity.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the track of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life, so that there is no financial burden on the family, not only illness.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from illness.
If anyone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can clean up.
And the other for whom I constantly urge is yoga.
Some people also call him yoga.
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
There is also an attraction for yoga all over the world, there is also faith and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a precious gift given to us, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from stress contributes the strength of living a balanced life.
Prevention is better than cure. Staying healthy in the lives of a person associated with yoga, staying balanced, being rich in strong will-power, a life full of unprecedented self-confidence, concentration in every work- these are comfortable achievements.
June 21 - Yoga Day is not just one event, its expansion increases, its place in every person's life, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his daily routine for yoga.
And 21st June Yoga Day inspires us for this.
And sometimes the collective environment becomes a cause for a change in the lives of a person.
Look at it, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, get it done in your city, in your school, in the institute, in the offices.
Start a month from now on, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
Many times I have read that Yoga and Pranayama are collective in several offices as soon as they get regularly in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much that the culture of the entire office changes and environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do yoga.
I urge you not to stay behind anywhere.
It is very important for you to stay healthy to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I consistently join you through the talk of Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, greetings to all of you again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste
Talk of mind, April 2016
Please change this condition, Ravi ji has expressed a lot of anger but I believe that perhaps he is not angry with me, he is angry with the situation and you will remember that Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that publish positive news on the first page of the newspaper, he used to constantly say this, a few days ago I had written a letter, he had said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give any negative news, positive news.
This time also I have seen that many letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are many stories, suggestions, motivations. Everyone wants to do something or the other. And I also want to say that there is a joy.
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book of stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared many types of books
I am happy that people are discussing and discussing the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, businesses, life characters.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to accept is that I can ' t give time to read a lot of books now
But there is a necessity that if you are writing and sending it then I have the opportunity to know about many books.
But this is the last one month's experience, I think we have to take it forward.
Why don't we make an appointment book corner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write there, discuss it and you can also sugest a good name for our books corner.
Friends, It seems that when I touched this thing in the matter of water conservation - Mann Ki Baat, but perhaps today I feel that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart even before I say that it was a matter of common man's favorite subject.
And I feel that these days the hearts of India have shaken about water .
Several stakeholders and effective efforts are going on across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods
Media has started several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Be it the government, the NGOs - are doing something at war level
Seeing the capabilities of collectiveness, the mind feels very good, it is very satisfactory.
The villagers donated labour and worked to give a certain direction to the waterfall flowing from the mountains.
That ' s the pure indigenous way
This has not only stopped the erosion of soil and the waste of the crop, but also the fields are getting water
You all will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of North East Meghalaya has become the first state in the country that has prepared its water policy, water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, the cultivation of crops is being promoted in which less water is required and there is no harm to the farmer.
I would especially like to congratulate the Government of Haryana for communicating with the farmers and motivating them from traditional farming, for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from all sections of society arrive in fairs
We can give the message of water saving in these fairs in a very effective manner, exhibitions, dramatic drama, we can easily reach the message of water conservation along with festivals.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with zeal and especially the achievements of the children, their performances, give us new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are Nidhi Bypotu, Monish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aranyatesh Ganguly and Heart Ala-Manda
What I will tell about them will fill you with pride and zeal.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is scared
It looks like standing at the gate of death, but all these ten children have defeated not only cancer, cancer, but have illuminated India's name in the whole world with their work.
In the sports, we often see that the players become champions after winning the tournament or after winning the medal, but this was a rare opportunity where they were champions before participating in the sports competition and they were also the champions of the war of life.
In fact, this month, World Childrens Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors i.e. those who have come out fighting cancer in their lives take part
Competitions like shooting, hess, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won the medal in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one sports
Indeed, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and thereafter there was no more discussion of big and important news like A-Sat in the face of the Handriyaan-two elections.
While we gained the capacity to kill the satellite three to hundred kilometers away from the A-SAT missile in just three minutes
India, the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on July 22, the whole country saw with pride how Handriyaan-two moved from Sriharikota to space.
Photos of the launch of Handrayaan-two filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness
Handriyaan-two, this mission is special in many ways
Handriyaan-two, will make our understanding about the moon even more clear
This will give us more detailed information about the moon, but if you ask me which two big learnings I got from Handriyaan-two, then I will say, these are two learnings are Haith and Cearlessness i.e. trust and fearlessness
We must rely on our talents and capacities, trust our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Handriyaan-two are completely in Indian color.
This is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is completely a indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when it is going to make some new taxes in the new sector, it has been decided to do so.
The way our scientists launched Handriyaan-Two by fixing all technological issues in record time and day and night, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
All of us should be proud of this and they have not changed the time to reach despite interruption .
We have to face temporary set backs even in our lives, but always remember that we have the ability to overcome it.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition with the students friends of the country, with young friends, about competition and invite the youth of the country to a ui Competition.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this ui Competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with their share.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
These victorious students will have a historic event of their life, but for this, you have to take part in the ui Competition, get the most marks, you have to be victorious
My dear countrymen, you must have done one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baats have accelerated the cleanliness campaign from time to time and similarly the efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago is setting up new standards of cleanliness with the participation of the people today.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal position in sanitation, but the way we have succeeded in the sanitation campaign from public places, it is the strength of the resolution of one hundred and thirty crore Indians, but we are not going to stop at all.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Mr Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and left his job in the US and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but also beauty some time ago.
He started with his team with Lodhi Garden dustbins
Through Street Art, worked to decorate many areas of Delhi with beautiful paintings
From the walls of the bridge and the school to the slums and slums, they started engraving their talents, the people also got together and in a way this series started.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during Kumbh .
Though there is no sound in colors and lines, but the messages of Indradhanush that are made from these pictures prove to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the sanitation campaign.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward in the direction of making trash from waste
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting comment on MyGov
This was the brother of Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to listen to the Mann Ki Baat program
I am happy to note that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
This program was organized in June.
I think such programmes should be organized every three months
Along with this, online monitoring of the program should also be arranged.
In my view, this was the first such programme of its kind in which the public had a direct dialogue with the government.
My eagerness to know about the Back to Village Programme after reading this message was sent to me by Bhai Mohammad Aslam ji and when I went in detail about it, I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are connected to the mainstream of development, how enthusiastic they are
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never seen the village had reached directly to the villages and reached their doors to understand the obstacles in the work of development, to solve the problems.
The programme lasted a week and in all about four and a half thousand Panchayats in the state, government officials gave detailed information about government schemes and programmes to the villagers.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What can their services affect the lives of the common man  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, This programme was not a government meal that the officers returned to the village after roaming around a day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat. This gave them the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other items were also included to make this programme interesting
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, job cards of MNREGA and SST certificates were also distributed
The people of Kashmir become open partners in this festival of development
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village programme was also organized in remote villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in the villages for more than two days
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, to participate in large numbers of people and prepare plans for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and glorious results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create barriers, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems as follows:
People of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way throughout India.
Whenever we see around us in this season it seems as if the earth has covered a green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts communicating
In this holy month, many devotees go to Kanwar Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami eagerly
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan also symbolizes the love of brothers and sisters.
When you are talking about the month of Sawan, you will be very happy to know that this time most devotees have joined Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1
More than the pilgrims who were involved in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, have joined this time in just 28 days.
I would like to appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests for the success of Amarnath Yatra.
Those who return from the journey are convinced of the warmth and spirit of their own people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have been told that in Uttarakhand this year, since the Chardham Yatra has started, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the severe disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must go to those parts of the country whose beauty is spectacular during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no teacher bigger than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan communicate new energy, new hopes and new hopes in you all.
Similarly, the month of August comes to remember the uit India
I would like you to make some special preparations on August 15 to find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see T, the same aspect of the rain looks like floods, filled water, traffic jam on all sides
To see the second picture of the monsoon in which our farmer, shining birds, flowing waterfalls, green sheet covered earth, you will have to go out with your own family
Rain, freshness and happiness i.e. both reshness and appinness bring with you, I wish this monsoon keeps you filled with frequent happiness.
My dear countrymen, very greetings to all of you
Today the people of Christian community are celebrating the Easter.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of Easter.
And for some people it will also be a covenant that on the one hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, T-20 cricket world up. Even today, you will probably wait for the match between India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A good momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I extend my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 percent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports, it does not matter.
Time is a new revolution in sports.
24 teams of the world are coming to play in India.
In 1951, 1962, India won the Gold Medal in the Asian Games and in 1956, India was at fourth place in the Limpic Games.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower pire, we went back, we fell and fell.
Hootball is an opportunity. Can you give me your suggestions
I believe a great opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider the opportunity to identify the youth of India, what was found between Match and what was lost in that sense.
With the preparation of this host, we can decorate our power, express our power and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, NarendraModiApp
My dear students, you must have thought of tourism during the holidays.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time also I had requested you to upload the photo from where you go.
People, languages, food habits do not know what to see.
India is full of diversity.
Once you get out to see, you will stay watching all your life
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to visit a lot.
When the Chief Minister was not, he was not the Prime Minister and was like you, I visited a lot.
I consider it a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope you can contribute to cleanliness when you go on migration in these holidays
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way but it's happening.
You can also emphasize cleanliness on tourist destination as a tourist
I believe my youngsters will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism as compared to the world.
But we should decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism to us and provide employment opportunities to crores of young people of our country.
Be it the government, the institutions, the society, the citizens, all of us are working together to do this.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, I do not like this that the holidays should come in such a way.
You also think in this direction.
Would your holidays, important years of life and also important time go like this
I have a idea to think of you.
Can you have a skill in the holidays, a resolution to add a new thing to your personality
If you don't have to swim, then you can decide on holidays, I can learn to swim, I don't come to cycle, then you can decide on holidays.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, will I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why not let us differ in our powers
Now think and somebody needs very big classes in it. There is no need for a trainer, a lot of wheels, a big budget.
You should also assume that I will make the best of the waste.
See something and start making it from it.
Namaste Prime Minister, you said in the last summer holidays that birds also feel heat, so we should keep in a utensil in water and put it in our balcony or on the roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I was happy, on this pretext my friendship with a lot of birds.
I urge you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something on this subject, but that Abhiyan reminded me that last year I had a soil utensil outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi a child.
He called me and remembered a good job.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and fill it in the hood, we will fill the sweet-sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhi and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of a very important thing.
Shilpa Cooked from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
He said that our households have milk sellers, newspaper sellers and postmen come.
Sometimes those who sell a utensil pass through there, those who sell clothes pass through.
Have we ever asked them for water during summer
Have we ever watered him
I am extremely grateful to you, Shilpa, you have kept a very sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
It is true that the matter is small but if the postman comes to the house in the middle of the heat and we have drank water then it will be good for him.
Well, this is the nature in India.
But I am grateful to Shilpa that you supervised these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the round of good crops these days, which medicines are suitable and many subjects are on it.
Not only this, there is a button that directly connects you with the agricultural scientists and connects you with the expertise.
If you keep your question in front of him, then he answers, explains to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters to download this Kisan Facilitation App on your mobile phone.
Try, do you have something to do with it
And yet, if you feel a shortage, then you should also complain to me.
But we also have to think about what will happen without water
Is this time when we are in our ponds, our ponds, our ponds, our ponds, our ponds, our ponds, our ponds, the ponds and ponds, where waste or some or the other encouraging happens then the water is ceasing and due to this, the water conservation is slowly decreasing.
Can we once again excavate those old places and prepare for more water conservation by cleaning them
If we save the water in the first rain, the ponds were filled, our river drains were filled then sometimes the rains were left behind and our losses were reduced.
This time you must have seen that 5 lakh ponds, farms and ponds have been taken up.
MNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be many such villages in the country, there will be many such progressive farmers, there will be many such aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizers has made our land mother sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth, we are children, how can we see our motherland sick
It is similar to the fertilizer, however the best fertilizer, but if they use more fertilizers to the extent then it will become a cause of waste.
The more water will be saved, the more will the farmer benefit, the more will his life be saved.
My dear countrymen, World Health Day is on 7th April and this time the world has focused on World Health Day on Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of illnesses followed by the Kurupi guests enter their homes and their bodies.
It is said that in 2014, there were about six and a half million patients in India.
The reason for 3 percent death is that diabetes were found.
And there are two types of diabetes. One type-1, type-2. type-1 has hereditary, hence it happens to the child.
And due to Type-2 habits, due to age, due to obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so the theme has been laid on the 7th of World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest reason for him.
Body labor is decreasing.
The name of sweat is not O-Nishan, it is not going to walk.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we do not hesitate to get medical check-ups.
And then after a very bad situation, it comes to mind that Oh, yeah, I had very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was young, I was scared to hear the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that which can be examined soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
You should check once.
And this disease can go.
Just get the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat it whether it is TB or Diabetes.
India has to get rid of these diseases.
But this government, doctor, medicine does not happen until you do it.
And therefore, today I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, there are several important occasions in the month of April, especially on April 14, the birthday of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate that I am fortunate to visit Mau, the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
To become an excellent citizen, Baba Sahib has given us a lot.
We can pay a great tribute to them by walking on that path as an excellent citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Savat will start.
Different states are celebrated in different states.
My best wishes to all for my New Year.
You can hear at your time.
You can listen to your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youth of India takes time to see the information about it, on the TV.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to go.
Like before, he does not go on the same route, he wants to do something new, he wants to see something new.
And there is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
And the identity of your personality and your confidence will increase so much.
This will probably be a matter of your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
If you download this Kisan Facilitation App in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and Weather in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there has been an opportunity for summer holidays for the rest of the people but it becomes an opportunity for the farmer to sweat even more.
He waits for the rain and before waiting, the farmer gathers with his life to prepare his farm so that he does not even want to waste a drop of rain.
It is very important for the farmers to start the season of agriculture.
That's the same food, isn't it bad
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were scared but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, greetings
You will have to listen to my mind on radio, but the mind will have to think that children's teams are starting, some people's 10th-12th edition is probably starting on 1st March.
So the same will happen in your mind too.
I also want to join you in this journey.
I am equally worried about the worries of your children.
But if we change our ways to look at the exams, then perhaps we can be anxious.
I had said in the last word of my mind that you must send your experience on Narendra ModiApp and your suggestions to me.
I am glad that teachers, those who have been doing a very successful job, parents and some thinkers of the society have sent me a lot of things by writing.
The second thing came so many thousands of things that I believe that perhaps this is a very important subject.
But most of us have limited the theme of CHAM to the school premises or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions that came on my app show that these topics of students should continue to be discussed in the entire country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, especially with the examinees and their teachers in this matter of mind.
I will also tell some of what I have heard, what I have read, what I have been told.
I will also add what I think.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to pay widows.
I would like to tell you the message that he has sent to the youngsters of India, such as Bharat Ratna, Mr. Sachin Tendulkar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that Ceams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
My only message is that your parents will make appointments to you, your teachers, your remaining family members will make friends.
Wherever you will go, everyone will ask how your preparation is going on, how many percent will you score.
I would like to say that you will set some target for yourself, do not come in the presurrection of anybody else.
You must work hard, but set a realistic achievement target for yourself and try to achieve that target.
So it was very important for me to insert a solution.
And those targets I always tried to achieve.
My focus was on the ball and the targets themselves became slowly-slowly achievements.
I would like to tell you that you, your thinking is very important.
The positive thinking will follow positive results.
So you will be positive and the above will definitely give you good results, this is my best hope and I would like to give you the best wishes for the teams.
Friends, See what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't suppress them under the burden of expectation.
You have to make your future.
You decide your goal by yourself, decide your target by yourself - free mind, free thinking, free power.
Why not competition
Why should we waste our time to compete with others
Why do not we competition ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from moving forward and when you break your previous records, you will not be expecting anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
Satisfaction will appear from one inside.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of digits.
Where to reach, how much
Do not stay stuck in that account.
Life should be linked to a great purpose.
One should walk with a dream, be determined.
These exams, they are going to be right or not, they calculate.
And that's why, if the vast, Virat dreams, then the examination will become a festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great purpose.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great objective.
Let's take a very big purpose and sometimes there will be less than expected, then there will be no disappointment.
And force, force, and dare to try.
Thousands of people who have written me small things from mobile phones on my app.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that a healthy mind remains in a healthy body.
Students should also take care of your health along with your studies so that you can write healthyly in the Ceam.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you start penalizing and going to run for three kilometers and five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how your routine is especially in the days of Ceam.
Anyway, 365 days of our routine should be favourable to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with one of the words of Shri Prabhakar Reddy Ji, he has specially requested that he should sleep on time and revision should be done early in the morning.
Entrance papers and other things should be reached before time.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said that I probably do not dare to say because I am a little sad about sleeping and my very friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is a shortage of me, I will also try to fix it.
The time of prescribed sleep, deep sleep - it is as important as your day-long activities and it is possible.
Otherwise some people have a habit, they keep talking on a long telephone before sleeping.
And when I talk about sleeping, do not think that I am asking you to sleep for Weam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam at the time of Ceam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise it should not be that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the son came less, then say that Modi ji had asked to sleep, so I was asleep.
Do not do this .
I don't believe you.
You must have seen that if one or half part of our body does not feel comfortable even in our body.
Not only this, our routine also rotates.
And that's why we don't consider anything small.
You can see that you do not get stuck in the habit of compromising yourself in what is determined.
Determine, see it.
You must have seen these two types of people.
The negative effect of the paper that will come in the tension of the paper is also there.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experience.
You must have seen that their eyes do not even go here and there.
We never heard, how did they look at Arjun's life in the bird's eyes
Exactly the same way when we see Vishwanathan playing, his eyes are absolutely larger on the target and it is an expression of peace within.
It is true that someone should say, that is why the peace within will come again, it is difficult to say, but you should try.
If you are not talking to friends or walking alone, you are shook a lot of books, then it cannot be calm.
You imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and you see very good things below.
But suddenly some stone starts shaking in the water and the water starts shaking, then what looks good beneath it looks like
If the water is calm, then how deep things are, it appears.
But if the water is disturbed, then nothing looks down.
You will not be able to find that treasure if you are unhappy, you will be able to find that treasure.
If you have a calm mind then that treasure will emerge in front of you and your team will become very simple.
And sometimes I try to understand by concentrating more, then I feel stress within one another.
Then I think, no, no, I'll relax a little, then I'll be good.
So I have developed my own technologies.
I'm very deep breathing.
I breathe deep.
I breathe deep three to five times, time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind is completely calm and ready to understand things.
It may be my experience, you can also work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents are also read in the house and even if parents are teachers in it, then they write the whole paper again, tell me what happened to you, what happened to you
Hey, I made a mistake.
Hey, I knew it, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in that.
Please blame with the family on other subjects and refresh the memories of old laughter.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with your parents, remember the scenes there.
Just spend half an hour after leaving them.
The matter of Rajat ji is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while interpreting him in the present context, he is trying to reach this ritual Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to revered Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that this time the people who have told me their experiences have discussed Yoga.
And it is a matter of pleasure for me that these days someone whom I meet in the world, why not get a little time, somebody does something about yoga.
Well, Friends, I would like to say today, Start Yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least a diameter, so do not do this today.
Do if you do it.
But it is true that Yoga is a big key in the development journey of Interman, whether it is a student in life or life.
There is simple key to simple.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you are aware of some yoga near you, you will ask them if you have not done yoga in the days of Ceam then you will tell them about two or four things that you can do in two to five minutes.
See, if you can
Yeah, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you have a hurry to go to the exam hall and you want to sit on your bench at a hurry
Why do these things in a hurry
Why do not make such a management of your entire day that if there is a stop in traffic, even then we will reach on time.
Otherwise such things create a new tension.
And one thing is that the time we have received, the question papers that are instruments and sometimes we feel that it will eat our time.
It's not like that, friends.
You can read those instruments closely, it will go for two minutes or three minutes or five minutes, there will be no harm.
But with the self-confidence of the same paper, now I have this paper, I have no new questions, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he has written that I understood this paper so easily, for the first time I felt that it does not come to me, but if I read the same thing again, I came to know that the question has been kept in another way, but this is the same thing that I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult by not understanding the questions.
I insist on the fact that you read questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match with what you know, you see that question will be simple before writing.
It is a matter of joy for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have stressed upon patience.
In very little words, but a very good message he has given to all the students.
I take half an hour to say that, they say that in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
Whatever they have said is determination, dedication, determination, dignity, stand up, friends, stand up.
If you stay stuck, then fear will also be scared.
And to do good, the golden future is waiting for you.
Now a message on my app, Ruchika Dabus has shared her team expertise.
He said that in his family there is a constant effort to create a positive atmosphere at the time of CHEAM and this was also discussed in his fellow families.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true, as Sachin ji also said, positive approach, positive frame of mind positive energy is highlighted.
Why not be you at any stage of life, best examples, truth events also inspire a lot of inspiration, give a lot of strength and create a new path during crisis.
We all read about the inventor of the Electricity Bulb Thomas Elva Edison, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb illuminates the lives of our people.
This is said, there are possibilities of success in failure too.
J. K. Raling is a great example that success can be achieved anytime.
Harry Potter Series are popular all over the world today.
But from the beginning it was not so.
How many problems they had to face.
Ralling himself had said that in difficulties all the energy used to be used in that work, which really meant for them.
DAM nowadays becomes not just of the student but of the entire family and of the entire school and of the teacher.
However, without the support system of Parents and Teachers alone, the situation is not good.
If we become a team, we move ahead in a planned manner with the same thinking as a unit, then the examination becomes simple.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the app, he has complained that Parents should never put pressure on their children to demand more marks.
Just encouraging preparation.
They should be crying, worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden his expectations on children.
This is right.
I don't want to tell the Parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to any of his friends, then do not stop.
Create a light environment, create a positive environment, see how much convenience your son or daughter will come.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead with the speed of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Knowledge, science and technology should become a comfortable part of our development journey and this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, Sometimes successes get very late and when success comes, the view of seeing the world also changes.
You might have been very busy in Czeam, perhaps it may have been possible that a lot of news has not been registered in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this to the countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a very big and important treasure in the world of science.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, did something or the other and after nearly 100 years a success took place.
The gravitational aves were exposed and detected by the mandate of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only proves the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century, but is considered to be a great discovery for physics.
This is a matter of work for the entire humanity, but as an Indian, we all are happy that the sons of our country and the proud scientists of our country were also associated with it in the process of searching.
I would like to congratulate and congratulate all those scientists today.
Our scientific efforts will continue to pursue this treasure in the future.
There is such a system in two places in the world, India is the third.
The connectivity of India will give a new strength to this process and will give a new momentum.
India will definitely be an active partner in the process of this great scientific treasure of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists, I convey my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, you can hear my mind from this number by calling a missed call tomorrow and also in your mother tongue.
I also have to pay the Ceam tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my mission.
Yes, you must have seen that I must have heard how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Just, let's be my diameter tomorrow, let's start with you.
And if we all succeed, the country will also succeed.
Friends, I extend my best wishes and best wishes to you all.
Free from the stress of success and success, move ahead of the free mind, stay steady.
Talk of mind, December 2015
I take a lot of care of this portal from Pune, Shri Ganesh V.
No, we have to make changes according to the requirements of India, we have to make it a change, we have to make the poor labourers somewhere, we have physical labour, but some youngster should make such a thing through innovation that there is a slight facilitation in the labour of the poor, I consider it as a start-up.
Then I thought that with the eyes we feel that they are disabled, but with experience it feels that they have some energy and extra power. And then I thought that why not we should use the word Divyang at the place of disabledness in our country. These people who have such an organ or more than one such organ in which there is a communication of divine power, there is no communication of divine power, which we do not have with ordinary body. I like this word very good. Can we preach the word Divyang instead of the habit of disabled people
Send this portal on my portal, I would like to see what the younger generation of my country thinks about duty. When we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, can we observe the best hygiene, best hygiene, best hygiene, best hygiene and best hygiene in our city by the citizens, by the children of school and colleges
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
You must have celebrated holidays very well during the holy festival of Deepawali.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal, business jobs will also start.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to fill wounds, sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes at this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
Continuous news of natural calamity comes from every corner of the world.
Never heard or ever thought about such natural calamities.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our own country, the way extreme rains and unseasonal rains and long-term rains, especially in Tamil Nadu, have also affected the states.
Many people were killed.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State Governments get full force in relief and rescue operations.
The central government also always works together with the shoulders.
Now a team of the Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I believe that in spite of this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, he will start moving ahead at a very fast pace and he will continue to play his role in pursuing the country.
But when they look at the problems all around, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be part of an agricultural department, because then the famine was limited to more natural calamities.
Today its form has changed.
After the Nepal earthquake, I had spoken to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
A good start has happened.
Today I got a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab to Lakhwinder Singh.
I am speaking to Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab district Jalandhar.
We cultivate organic farming here and also guide many people about cultivation.
I have a question that the people who set fire to these fields, how to guide them to the barley or wheat shrubs, how to spoil the microbes that are to the mother of the earth and how to get relief from the pollution that is happening in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji, I was very happy to hear your message.
One of the joys is that you are a farmer who cultivate organic farming.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers well.
And your concern is true but it does not happen only in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of our people in the whole of India and traditionally we move on the path of burning the remains of our crop.
Secondly, what are the measures, it has not been trained.
And when the impact of this crisis started coming to the cities, a bit of noise began to be heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have a biological fertilizer.
Secondly, due to burning, the upper layer of the earth is burnt.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a moment, think that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, the kidney is good, everything is good but what will happen if the skin above the body burns
In the same way, the relics of these crops are not just burnt by burning the throats, this earth's mother's skin is burnt.
The upper layer of our land is burnt, which pushes our fertilizer land towards death.
And that's why he should make positive efforts.
Once again this throat was dumped into the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if you put a pile in a pit and put a little water in it, then it becomes the best kind of organic fertilizer.
I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who once cultivated banana.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate bananas and when the banana crop was finished, they had to spend Rs. 5 thousand, 10 thousand and 15 thousand per hectare for cleaning the bananas.
And till the people who picked him up, they used to stand in such a way as they did not bring tractors.
But some farmers proved that they pieces of 66, 8-8 inches of that thumb and buried it on the ground.
So the experience came that there is so much water in the throat of this banana that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get it out for three months.
Those who had to spend the cleanliness of the throat before, the demand for the throat has increased today.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist, how much small experiment can benefit.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will remember the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Last time I had discussed the organization in Mann Ki Baat.
I had also discussed the helpline of NEET for the organisation and I was told that after that thing of mind the phone calls increased almost 7 times.
Film actress Raveena Tandon, including very well-known people, joined it.
Organ nation can save precious lives.
Angadan comes in a way with immortality.
When the body goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this
I am confident that there will also be widespread awareness on this area and in true sense, the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be found from anywhere else unless anyone donates.
As I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disability Day.
Physically and mentally disabled are also rich in an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes pain occurs when sometimes they get ridiculed.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision, change the view of seeing them, then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass through.
If we get a little trouble, we sit to cry.
Then remember that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And that's why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
His determination power, his way of fighting with life and his ability to convert the crisis into capability is worthy.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 is old.
In 1996 Kashmir, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists.
He lost a part of the intestine and intestine.
Serious nature has become a spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet always went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism could not even touch them.
His own tongue, but the biggest thing is that without any reason a innocent person has to face such a big problem, youth has become in danger, but no resentment, no anger, this crisis has also been converted to Javed Ahmed's sensitivity.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been drowned in children's studies.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for handicappedness in public places, government offices
They are working on that.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, I am talking about Javed, but the lamps of such inspiration are burning in every corner of India.
They are giving new lights of living, showing the way.
December 3 is an opportunity to remember all such people and get inspiration from them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we have dependence on the governments.
Be it a middle class person, a lower middle class person, a poor person, a dalit, afflicted, exploited, deprived, there is a constant relationship with the government systems.
And as a citizen, sometimes a bad experience comes from somebody or the other government Babu.
And that bad experience changes our view of looking at the government system throughout the life.
There is also a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government work with service, dedication and dedication.
Sometimes we do not even know because it is so comfortable that we do not know that any government system, any government administration is doing this work.
ASA workers in our country which are networks across the country.
We have sometimes heard of the discussions between the people of India regarding ASA workers and you must have heard of them.
But when I am the world famous family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both such Billgates and Milinda Gates last time.
They do a lot of social work in India.
He is spending his retirement time and his lifelong earnings in working for the poor.
Whenever they come and meet and those who have got the opportunity to work with the ASA workers, they appreciate them so much, and they have so much to say that what is the dedication to the ASA workers.
How enthusiastic it is to learn new things, they tell all these things.
In the past, the Orissa Government has given special respect to an ASA worker on Independence Day.
Tendagaon, a small village in Balasore district of Orissa, is a hope worker and the entire population is schedule-tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And a hope-worker of this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this village.
If the news of a small fever comes to the house-to-house then reach.
Based on the primary arrangements taught to him, it is necessary for treatment.
Emphasis on every house to use pesticide mosquitoes.
As your own child sleeps properly and as much care should be done, ASA worker Jamuna Manisingh continues to work with full dedication to avoid the whole village mosquitoes.
And he fought with malaria, prepared to fight the whole village.
How many such Jamuna Mani will be.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We will look at them with a slight respect.
Such people become the great strength of our country.
How are the big companions of the happiness and misery of the society
I sing their pride to all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see it.
Not only this, others also show it and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
-Books should be discussed and if a enthusiastic young man goes to schools in the neighbourhood and tell the children of class VI, Ninth, Tenth, that this happened here.
So you can become a society teacher in true sense.
I invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
There is also a discussion on climate change, global warming, dugger-dager and it is being approved as a standard before doing every work.
The temperature of the earth should no longer increase.
It is also the responsibility of everyone. It is also anxious.
I had once said that on the night of full moon one should bathe in the light of the whole moon by shutting down the street lights and darkening it.
You should experience the light of that moon.
Any friend had sent me a link to see and I got the opportunity to see him, then I was convinced that I should tell you this thing too.
Noorjahan in Kanpur does not seem to be a woman on T.
But one such thing is doing which may not have been thought by anyone.
He is working to give light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting with darkness and is illuminating his name.
He has created a committee of women and has installed a plant of solar energy lanterns and gives lanterns for a rent of Rs. 100 per month.
It costs about Rs. 3-4 per day, but the entire household has light and it continues to recharge the lantern with solar energy in that plant throughout the day.
Now see what big people of the world will have to do for climate change but a Noorjahan may inspire everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means illuminating the world.
Light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I congratulate HeeT because he has presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur to the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Abhishek ji thanks
What you sent me from Gorakhpur
Under the Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
By the way, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana.
Whether it is washing, bearing, selling newspapers, selling milk.
I am glad that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And mostly those who help SC, ST, B are the people of this class who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told about his enthusiasm.
I also have a lot of news.
I have just told someone that there are some Shailesh Bhosale in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakhs from the bank under MRA scheme.
And they started sewage dress, cleaning businesses.
I had said about the time of my Swachhta Abhiyan that Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will prepare new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosle did it.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time, they returned to the bank.
Eventually this is the intention under our MRA scheme.
Somebody told me about Mamta Sharma of Bhopal that she received 40 thousand rupees from the bank from this Prime Minister MRA scheme.
He is working to make a butterfly.
And it makes a butterfly, but earlier it used to bring money from more interest and it used to do business with great difficulty.
Now due to his good amount of money coming together, he made his work more good.
And due to the extra interest, and due to the reasons, the money that was spent on him had come into his hands in these days, he started saving more than one thousand rupees every month.
And his family gradually started to grow a good business.
But I would like the plan to be more propagated.
All our banks are more sensitive and help more and more small people.
Indeed, these people drive the economy of the country.
Those who do small work are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to force him.
It's good, but it's better to do.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed an India-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should remain consistently aware of social life.
Rashtriyama Awakening Veteran International Vigilance is the Price of Liberty country's unity, this Sanskrit Sarita should continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat, I want to make it a plan.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on him.
How is the programme's structure
What's the logo
How to increase public participation
I said for all the suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
No big prices have also been declared.
You should also put your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity be linked to Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat
What is the plan, how is the program
Whether it is alive, it is spectacular, it is lifeless and it is easier to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What will society do
There can be many things.
It enjoys wearing clothes, but I will be urging you to exercise.
I will urge you to use this good weather for some time to keep the body healthy.
And in the family, there should be a festival of the family, it should be done by one hour.
So there is a good weather, then there will be a good habit.
Once again, I got the privilege of connecting with all of you with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This is the series named Gandhi Mandela Series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all my players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of the Kannur Centre of AIR.
Congratulations have to be given because when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I have to talk about Kerala once again.
The students of Saint Mary Oper-Primary School in Chittor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One of these girls has made a picture of Mother India with their thumb marks, on a very big cloth.
I have sent that picture of the map of India and Mother India.
First I was surprised why they made India's map with their thumb mark.
But when I read his letter, I understood how good symbolic message he had given.
These are the girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their area and their mission is Angadan.
They are running a mass awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also performed drama stages in many places so that the understanding of Angadan spread among the people.
Angadan became a trend and tendency.
These girls have written to me in the letter that you should appeal to people about organ donation in your mind.
They say Angadan should make a festival.
These days I have a lot of messages on phone calls.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
The organ of the body can be donated when death occurs in a road accident.
There are many legal confusions too.
Efforts have been made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to reduce the paper action and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is in the advance line in the field of organ donation organ donation.
Many social institutions, many NGOs are doing very good work in this direction.
The National Organisation and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOT) has been established to promote organ transplant.
A 247 Elpline 180011470 is also available.
And it has been said here that the joy of renouncing Ten Tyakteen Bhunjitha is a very good description of this mantra.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor contractor, Hawker and his wife were transferred to GB Pant Hospital in Delhi.
And these five were tried and brought from Lucknow to Delhi.
And that operation was successful.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
Ten Tykten Bhunjitha, we should perform this feeling and we must emphasize this.
Dear countrymen, just now we celebrated the festival of Navaratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, Deepawali will also be celebrated.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time on the soil of India, such a large scale is being organized.
Chavan African countries and leaders of unions have been invited.
Outside Africa, the biggest conference of African countries is happening.
The relations between India and Africa are deep.
The population of India is as much as the population of African countries.
And if we mix both, we are one-third of the world's population.
And it is said that millions of years ago, it was the same territory.
Later these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of equality.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very big role in training the younger generation of African countries.
More than 25 thousand African students have studied human resources development, capacity building in India.
And today there are many African leaders who have studied in India.
So how deep we have.
And in that sense, this summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, the heads of different countries are found.
In the same way, a meeting of heads is going to be held in a summit.
Look, it is our endeavour to meet the people too.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the KRM, has done a very good programme.
There was a synthetic competition between the children of all the eligible schools of the BSF, a programme was organized to write poems and to increase their participation.
Nearly 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
Thousands of schoolchildren wrote things that emphasize the Indo-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma is reaching Delhi on 29th October, traveling from Porbandar to Northern States.
Millions of school children saw this exhibition, the village-village people saw it.
There were very good types of compositions in this competition.
My attention goes towards a composition, I like, so I want to tell you.
But we can clearly see how it becomes an opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate the dignity, all the children participating in it, more than 1600 schools and the RM Ministry.
I had proposed a proposal regarding MP Adarsh Gram Yojana for the last time on August 15.
After that many MP friends realized this work.
Staying with big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these ideal villages are happening, the heads of the village, the collector of that place, some MPs from there, the Indo-Government, the state government, all together discussed the ideal Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these Left extremists, many areas of the area have been wasted.
But our MPs there are very big and sometimes deputy speakers in Parliament, Mr. Karia Munda ji, they have spent their lives for the tribals.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate the Honble MP Mr. Karia Munda ji.
That's what I got from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji consumed himself in the scheme of Adarsh Gram and he chose the Adarsh Gram Panchayat by Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh for Adarsh Gram.
The rest of the arrangements are being done but they have done a special innovative work.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane Festival on 11th March in the village.
People from all the areas united in it.
How can the village be made a centre of economic activity, how can it be marketed for the village production.
His efforts to build an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village are indeed an officer of the greetings of Shri Ruwala ji.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be so
I have sent a message from Mumbai by Savita Rai through a telephone to clean our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
We should make this Diwali clean along with our homes as well as our outside environment and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I would like to remind you of my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media, especially the media, launched a big campaign and after Diwali, all those things where firecrackers were lying and he said that this is not good.
So your point is true that we should do whatever we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And I would like to congratulate the media world of India especially today.
India Awards and I was also seeing how many types of activities are going on.
How many people are working like a One Like One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean.
All these things were highlighted and I congratulated the commendable work of India TV Group at that time.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that Tenadu from Andhra and Telangana, especially Shri Ramuji Rao, is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than a young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from around 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, in many places, there is a big campaign for cleanliness.
Now these news shows themselves the strength to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News has started this program in my name as India and worked to train the countrymen by highlighting the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
Our country has hundreds of channels, thousands of newspapers and everybody, I am not able to take the names of everyone due to lack of time, but this campaign has been launched.
And that is why Savita Roy ji has suggested that the whole country is accepting this work and is moving ahead.
Mr. Shanmuganathan, our Governor of Meghalaya, has written a letter to me and wrote a letter to me and recalled me about the village of Mavalyanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken up a pedestrian of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this cleanliness.
And it is said that a few years ago, he got the award in the form of Asia's Cleanest District.
This is what makes us all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say 125 crore Indians with pride, we have freed our Mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that there are some things where corruption has gone home.
When a poor person goes for a small job, he does not know what he has to suffer and how a group of brokers grabbs Rs.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who tests a person in a minute, two minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we have these small piry jobs, we should end the tradition of interview there.
My dear young friends, I would like to say today with pride that the government has completed all the procedures and there will be no interview for recruitment in Group D, Group C and Non-Getted posts of the Central Government.
It will be implemented on 1st January 2016.
We will not make any obstacles in the process where the process is going on, but, it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
My best wishes to all young friends.
Well, in the last budget, we had declared an important plan.
Gold in our country has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold has been considered as a means of economic security.
Crisis time key is considered to be gold.
Gold can become the economic property of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am happy that we have promised in the budget, in this festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people buy gold especially on that day, we are going to launch important schemes before that.
We have brought the Gold Monetization Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier, we used to keep in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now you will keep in the Gold Bank and the money bank will give you as interest.
Say, Can the countrymen now become gold property or not
Can't gold be converted into a vibrant force from Head-Money
Just. That's what we have to do with you.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
One more thing is that in sovereign gold bonds you do not have a gold lump in your hands.
So you will get two and a half thousand rupees in exchange for that paper.
So we are starting it.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and no one will come to steal the paper.
So I will surely put this scheme guaranteeing security in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to say that we are also bringing gold ueen.
It has been about 70 years since independence, but till now we have been using Foreign Gold Oin or Gold Bulleon Bars.
At the same time, the Golden Jubilee of twenty grams will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, is the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
Recalling Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the whole map of India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to India's unity.
He has introduced his capabilities as a iron man.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but his dream of uniting India was.
He showed geographically tax, but the mantra of unity should be the medium of our thinking, behavior and expression.
Many cult, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many surroundings, so many diversities are our country and this diversity is our beauty.
If this was not diversity then perhaps we could not do the beauty we are proud of.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the roots of development.
Run for Unity programs are being organized in many corners of the country on October 31 for the last several years.
I have heard that this time also its plans are being made around, people are preparing for the race of unity with enthusiasm.
The race of unity is the race of development in true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of the race of development is also a race of unity.
Let us pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Progress the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, Now all of you will be engaged in the preparations for Diwali, cleanliness will be done in the house.
New things will be purchased.
Deepawali festival is celebrated differently in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the auspicious festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come in mind.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Deepawali, I have to visit Britain.
I am very thrilling for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such classes of society, be it dalit, tribal or backward, such promising children who go abroad.
I believe that when our children of India go to study in the UK then this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them, an inspiration land will become a land and learn something in life but later to live for the country, the same message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am telling you that during my visit to Britain, I am specially thrilled, the subject had been entangled for several years and now that building becomes the property of 125 crore Indians, the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is connected then you can imagine how much joy will be for people like me.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Vishwaswar for democracy, for the Employment of Women is a really studying aspect of the world.
The unveiling of the statue of Lord Vishwaswar on the land of London is an excellent example of how long the great men of India thought in themselves centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are associated, we all get thrilled in the minds of the people of India.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with the talk of mind.
By telephone, myGov.in keep on meeting your suggestions.
Akashwani is also discussed in your letters.
There is a discussion by calling government officials.
Some people write their problems, they also try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but still there are so many languages that where did I learn
But yet, I am grateful to AIR that they broadcast this mind at 8 o'clock in the regional language of every state.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the matter is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
My dear countrymen, once again, my best wishes.
Jai Hind
Talk of mind, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
On the other hand, on the one hand, Parliament and on the one hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, the child of this country should talk about cleanliness, what can be the good fortune of this bigger country.
The institutions of local Swaraj - whether it is Panchayat or Nagar Panchayat or municipality or the municipality or the state or the centre - everybody will have to work on this. And we have to carry forward this movement, we have to move forward despite the shortcomings and in 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi. And you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
And I was surprised that the girl, the entire Gita, who was in the midst of her throats. But the biggest thing I felt that when I asked her, she used to explain her verse, define her in English, I used to define her in Hindi, I asked her father, she was speaking from the age of five years.
Speak, we do not even know, so I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and dos anything
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about the mind.
People in the far south are blossomed at the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes related to social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a very short span of time, all of them have accepted these schemes.
I had made a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan we should give these security schemes to our sisters.
I have come to know that since the launch of the scheme, eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme.
And I was also told that almost half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the richness of the poor.
The poor had to open an account with zero balance but by saving, saving and depositing the amount of twenty thousand crores.
The mainstream of the economy is also the banking sector and this system has reached the poor house, so the bank-friendly scheme has also been emphasized.
Today more than one and a half lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
Now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and urge all those who open the bank accounts to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters that you should not break the ties with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it now.
I'm brought to you, it's your job to hold him now.
All of us should be active.
But in a very short time, the enlightened people of Gujarat, all my citizen brothers and sisters took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again he went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brotherhood is the right path and on the path of development, we have to walk shoulder to shoulder.
Development is a solution to our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of Sufi tradition.
I got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell the truth that the way I got the opportunity to listen to their words, some kind of music is playing in a way.
The choice of his words, his way of conversation, that is, the generosity in the Sufi tradition, which is a beauty, in which there is a rhythm of music, all of them were experienced between these scholars.
I like it very much.
Perhaps the world has become the most important to reach the right form of Islam in the right way.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition, which is associated with love and generosity, will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity and also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but, sometimes, we should understand the Sufi tradition.
I am going to get another opportunity in the coming days, and I consider this invitation as my privilege.
In India, scholars of Buddhist traditions of many countries of the world are going to come to Bodh Gaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also received an invitation in it and I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodh Gaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to have an opportunity to go to Bodh Gaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a very happy moment for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you about Mann Ki Baat, especially today.
I have already mentioned this subject in the matter of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard that I must have heard in Parliament, have heard in public meetings, have heard in the matter of mind.
I have come to say one thing every time that the government's mind is open in the matter of the And Acquisition Act which is being disputed.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers, I have been saying this again and again.
This means that my government was formed and the situation that was before that has now been reinstated.
But one thing was incomplete in it and it was that there were 13 such points that had to be completed in a year and that is why we brought him in the ordinance, but due to these disputes, the matter was also entangled.
We are implementing these 13 points under the rules so that there is no loss to the farmers, there is no financial loss to the farmers. And therefore, we are fulfilling the 13 points that were left in the previous law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us. This is our mantra - the welfare of the village, the poor farmer and that is why we have said on 15th August that not just the farming department but the decision of the agriculture and farmers welfare department will be made at a rapid pace.
I have to say one more thing that two days ago, fifty years of the 1965 war and whenever the war of 1965 comes, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan Mantra.
And it is very natural to remember the tricolor flag of India, those who maintained its glory and those martyrs.
I salute all the concerned of the victory of the 65th war.
I salute the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
The way I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, I had a great pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the dignitaries of the country for hours.
They got the opportunity to hear and I am happy that in the field of science, India is working in many directions and in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing best.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these amendments to the common man.
How to transform the principles into equipment
How to add Lab to And
He has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that he was also a very inspiring and academic for me.
And I saw how many young scientists were talking with zeal, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I think there are many opportunities, there are many possibilities.
I have many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
The emphasis has been laid on reforms in the education sector.
I have to especially tell my young friends that I had told the Red Fort on 15th August why this interview for the lower level job
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also a reason for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on 15th August that I want the freedom of interview below one level.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has just been 15 days but the government is moving forward very fast.
Notices are being sent and now the decision will also be implemented that small jobs will be left out of the interview round.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment, no defect.
These days guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For the health, especially for the maternal mortality and infant mortality rates, all the 24 countries of the world have contemplated together in the land of India.
This was the first time outside the United States, this program took place in another country.
And it is true that even today, in our country, about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die every year at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
This is worrying and scary.
By the way, the improvement is enough.
India has also started appreciating internationally, yet this figure is not less.
Just as we got rid of polio, we also got rid of tetanus in the death of mothers and infants.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers and save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays news of dengue continues to come.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am not talking about Swachh Bharat is connected directly to it.
We look at the advertisation on T, but we do not pay attention.
Advertisement is published in the newspaper, but we do not pay attention.
There are ways to maintain cleanliness with pure water in small things in the house.
There is a widespread public education in these things, but we do not pay attention and sometimes it seems that we live in very good households, are very good arrangements and we do not know that ourselves are full of water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge you all that death should not be allowed to become so cheap.
Life is very precious.
It is not okay for the indifference of water, indifference to hygiene, it becomes the cause of death.
Free checking facilities are available for dengue at around 514 centres across the country.
It is useful to get a check done from time to time and it is very important for all of you to collaborate in it.
And hygiene should be of great importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not connect every festival with cleanliness now
You see rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to give you a good news, I always say that now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country but we have got the good fortune to live for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced India's pride.
In the United States, there is a cycle race, it is very difficult and there is about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year, these two brothers won this race.
See how everybody is making his own efforts to move the country forward.
And this is the case, when you hear such incidents, the chest gets strained.
Sometimes due to perception, we commit extreme injustice to our youth.
And the old generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything. And I understand that this series has been going on for centuries.
The experience of my youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth, we also get a lot to learn.
I have met many youngsters who say that brothers, I have taken a fast in my life, Sunday on cycle.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day in a week.
It is also good for my health.
And I also have a great joy of being my young man.
Nowadays, bicycle runs in many cities in our country and people who promote bicycle are also very much.
But they are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today when two youngsters of my country hoisted the flag in the United States, I like to mention the direction in which the youngsters of India think.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra, especially today.
I'm happy.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - the land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - had been hanged for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now there will be a magnificent divine motivation monument of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who will continue to inspire us to work for Dalits, oppressed, exploited and deprived.
But at the same time, where Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been bought.
When the Indians traveling around the world go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to be built there will become an inspirational place for the Maharashtra government.
I would like to give sadhusat to the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, You must tell me your ideas before the next Mann Ki Baat, because I believe that democracy goes on with public participation.
The country can move forward by mixing shoulders with shoulders.
My best wishes to you all.
This year the rain has started a good start.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely get help in sowing kharif.
And a happy thing has come to me and I am very happy.
In our country there is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds of oilseeds.
The poor should have pulses, there should be some oil in vegetables etc. to eat.
I extend my best wishes to my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, on July 26, Kargil Vijay Diwas is marked in the history of our country.
The relationship of the farmer of the country is as much as the land as the young man of the country.
In the Kargil war, one of our young men and hundreds of enemies was overwhelming.
I salute those brave soldiers who did not care about their lives, who foiled their enemies' efforts.
The war of Kargil was not fought only on the borders, every city of India, every village was contributed to this war.
This war was fought for those mothers and sisters whose young son or brother was fighting with enemies in Kargil.
The daughters fought, whose hands did not get the henna of yellow.
And therefore, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I salute all our soldiers.
On 26th July, from another point of view, I consider it a bit important because after the formation of our government in 2014, we started MyGov on 26th July in a few months.
Our resolution to enhance public participation in democracy, to connect the people in the work of development and I am happy to say that after a year, about two crore people have seen MyGov.
And the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested the PM applications, they took time out, thought it was important.
Now the matter is small, but no one has ever noticed this in the government, neither has it been thought about it.
But on the suggestion of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government considered it seriously, and today this system has been implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, there are very positive suggestions on MyGov, the people who are formed, the tag-lines are formed, the programme is created, the policy is formed.
There is a new Resh Hair experience in the governance system.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days, I have also started suggestions on MyGov, what should I say on August 15
Suchitra Raghwachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Beti Bachao, speak on daughter-learning, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But I had an idea, what should I say on August 15 this time, can you send me suggestions
You can send to MyGov, write a letter on AIR, write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe that perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on 15th August should be suggested from Janardhan.
I believe you will definitely send good suggestions.
I want to express my concern towards one thing.
I do not want to give any preaching nor am I looking for a way to avoid the responsibilities of the units of state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I looked at the scene of an accident in Delhi, and after the accident, the scooter driver was starving for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people continue to write to me on the fact that you should speak on road safety.
Be aware of the people, Hoshakote of Bangalore should be Akshay, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidari in Karnataka.
And when we look at the statistics, the heart moves.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to road accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of those who die are young people of 15 to 25 years of age and one death shakes the entire family.
The government should do whatever work I want to do, but I wish my parents and my children, whether they run two wheelers or run four wheelers, the atmosphere of paying attention to the security of the family should also be increased.
There is another project for us, it is going to be expanded further, it is going to be expanded for Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, from there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mandia highways, we have a lots treatment. And this means that we are giving priority to the people who are injured in the road accident once after leaving all these concerns.
Toll-free 1033 numbers, ambulance arrangements for providing information about accidents across the country, all these things have been done after the accident.
For not being an accident, we all really need to see one life is very dear, one life is very dear.
Sometimes I say, Employees become Karmayogi.
Some incidents came to my notice in the past, I felt good that I would talk to you, sometimes a person who works and works gets tired and sometimes a person gets tired.
I was very good to see this example of how life can be brought in my work.
Vijay Biswal has told how his interest, his art, his capability can be linked to his work.
It may be that now Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And also in my mind, the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh started a work that touched my mind and I like this thing.
He started Operation Male War - Now it will be somebody, listening to it will be something else.
See how Raksha Bandhan has changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Now a news had come to my ears, sometimes these small things enjoy my heart so I am sharing you.
There is a small village in Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now no person has to go to the open defecation in that village.
He did this, but when the entire work was completed, the whole village celebrated such a big festival as it is celebrated.
These excellent examples of how the values are changing in the society, how the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Decca, Guwahati, regarding the questions of the North-East.
However, the people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, it's a good thing.
But today I would like to please tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
We will go to the districts, we will go to the villages, we will meet the local government officials, we will talk to the people, we will talk to the citizens.
We will listen to the problems, we will also do what the Government of India has to do in the direction of solving the problems.
This effort will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come to know how beautiful the state is, how good people are, now they have to live by developing this area and solving their problems.
If you return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is to go from Delhi to far East, which I am saying Act East Policy, this is the act.
My dear countrymen, we are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
But sometimes it comes to the idea that if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be, then one or two of the 100 students will be able to get a scientist who will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
It is a great need to take interest in innovation, encourage them, know their capabilities.
I also tell the IAS officers of the government that if you have moved forward by reading so much then you should also go to a school and college near you for two to four hours a week and talk to the children.
The experience that you have, the strength that you have, will definitely benefit from this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have started it and in the coming years, we will get 24 hours of electricity to the villages.
Even the children of the village have to read in the days of the examination, then there is no problem of electricity.
Even if small industries are to be installed in the village then electricity is obtained.
Today, even if you have to charge the mobile, you have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
I know that such a big country, lakhs of villages and villages have to reach far and wide.
But, it is only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, it was decided to talk differently.
In a way, our country has the opportunity to celebrate the month of August, September.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to all of you.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your ideas will be of great use to me.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you people that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture there then there is an incredible IDFI.
When I said, I did not think that such a strong result would be found.
Millions of people posted photos, on Twitter, Facebook Pay, Instagram.
I can say that more than one can see a scene, India is filled with diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that people can do such a big job in terms of tourism.
And I also felt so much that I re-tweeted him too.
The world will see, our countrymen will see, our new generation will see.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but sometimes the person within me loses in itself by removing all the posts and prestiges.
On June 21, International Yoga Day, I can say that my mind was agitated in the same way when I had put this subject in the ND.
We can say with the claim that the sun never erupts in the world of yoga practices.
The way the world has honoured Yoga by laying its eyes and feet, the way the whole world has raised it on its shoulders, who will be the Indian who will not be proud of it.
The mind got blurred.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and the File Tower are very proud, they liked that place to do yoga, gave equal place.
People in New York participated in Times Square.
If we talk about Australia, Sydney, then the picture of the pera house comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done yoga at the same place by placing yoga equal to the pera house.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's home athlete, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPAC-Keeeping Force also performed very well in Yoga.
Even in India, our soldiers were performing yoga on the white ice sheet in Siachen, on the four sides of the Navy, wherever our naval ships were there, Yoga was organized.
Delhi has registered its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogpath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that this was not the last programme of any programme.
It seemed that a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal, a new connectivity from every corner of the world.
A few days ago, when a family from Vietnam had tweeted a photo while serving a small child, it was so loved that photograph was so popular all over the world.
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, the elderly, the village-city, the developed countries or the developing countries, everybody has joined.
Yoga became a reason for connecting the world in true sense.
But I feel one thing and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity has increased towards India.
The values here, the traditions here, the heritage here, the world wants to know.
We all have the responsibility that we should share the world and make the world familiar with this legacy of ours without interference.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, what is new in it, like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I must say it will be amazing.
There are many such things that our ancestors have given us and the best that the world has the right to do.
The success of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give the world the best yoga teacher.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of Yoga from one platform to the world.
Be it introduction of institutions related to yoga, knowledge of Yoga Gurus, information about yoga.
If you want to learn yoga, where you can learn, where you want yoga teachers, where you will get a database and I believe you can do it.
Let's start somewhere, it will also become a new power.
I have seen the events of the past few days and from the point of view that the working government, the running government, once the goal is fixed, how can the results be achieved, we have seen it in the past.
And when there was disappointment all around, we should not forget that one year ago, one voice was heard from all sides, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, no one ever pays attention to it.
Once a small news comes to the newspaper once in 2-5 years, in a corner, a small department, but he led Yoga Day.
And the smaller departments in the world have organized such a big task.
If the goal is in front, then it is a sample of how small units work.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the injured people from Yemen.
Within hours, how the people of India ran to help Nepal, when the government working in the bank had to open Jan Dhan accounts, the people of all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time, crores and crores of countrymen were connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had appealed to the Red Fort for toilets in schools and I had said that by the next 15th August we have to complete this work.
The work that could not be done in 60 years was very courageous to invite them to make about four and a half lakh toilets in a year, but today I can say with satisfaction that there is a delay in coming to August 15, but it has not been completed, but people have completed the work of making toilets in schools.
That is, the government, the people, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month we had launched three public security schemes, I had from Calcutta.
There has been very positive results in such a short time.
There has been very little work in terms of public security in India but due to these three schemes we are applying a very big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined the schemes of these people's security, but we have to move it further.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can have a very big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolution together with me.
When I talk about mind, many people also send me suggestions.
This time many people have sent suggestions that I should say something for the monsoon.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for the monsoon, you must tell some things about the matter of mind.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also have to enjoy hot pakods, nuts, corn and tea in the rain.
But as well as the way the sun rays give life, the same rain gives strength to our life.
The water of the village remains in the village, the water of the city remains in the city, it should be our resolve, we should try to stop the water.
And the rain water stops and if it returns to the ground and there is a recharge in the land, then the problems of the year are resolved.
I always tell the people that if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and visit Mahatma Gandhi's house, then there is a tank in the underground within his two hundred years old house where rain water was directly there.
Porbandar is on the coast of the sea, but sweet water was collected and kept in the house, at that time so much care was done.
We can also do it.
All of us should be in large quantities by the social organisations and the youth in this rainy season.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a very successful experience.
This is my absolutely rural technology.
When you plant, put an old soil pot in the bag of the plant and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month, then it will also run.
I also tell the farmers to plant trees instead of fenced on the banks of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that in the rainy days, diseases spread very much with water.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria begin to grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
The urge to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that the number of care we will do will be far away from us.
Water should also be required, rain should also be avoided but also avoid illness.
Friends, We have just launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small cities in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities livelihoodable.
In the same way, such a country should also be equal to the world.
There should be such a smart city in the country and on the other hand, the poorest of the poor people of the country should have their homes to live and the houses that have electricity, water, toilets and schools should be arranged to read nearby.
When India celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big scheme has been started.
I am confident that all these schemes will help in bringing about a change in urban life.
I myself remain connected with all of you through social media, many new ideas keep meeting you people and also get good information about the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a remote village also touches our heart.
You know that a Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho Programme is being run by the government.
But when the government's programme makes a person, society and village its own, how much increases its strength.
In the past, a Sarpanch of Bibipur village in Haryana, Shri Sunil Jaglan ji took a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low compared to children.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
Most in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village of Haryana will turn this way, then the mind is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
So I express my happiness.
But I am also inspired by this incident and that is why I also urge you to post your selfwithdaughter with your daughter, selfwithdaughter with your daughter.
Beti Bachao-Beti Teacho will write a tagline that gives strength to this idea, will write a best line, it can be in any language, whether it is English or Hindi or your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspiring tagline that I will be from that selfie of your daughter and I will retweet you.
We all can transform this thing into a mass movement in a way, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao.
The work that was started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village of Haryana and we should move ahead and I urge you to select withdaughter.
So my best wishes to all of you in this rain, enjoy the rain.
Make our country green.
International Yoga Day is not for one day, but you continue the practice of yoga.
You see, you'll see the benefits of this.
Make it a part of your life.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere and send photographs.
The country and the world will know how diverse our country has.
And I felt that there has been a very small deal of handicrafts in it.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the features of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we will definitely reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet the next time for the next thing.
He used to hear and repeat a lot of things, and sometimes he used to become a motivation for his own words, in a light atmosphere, in the form of a selfish family of 130 crore Indians.
You can imagine how it might have gone into the middle of the middle.
Perhaps, it wasn't a lifeless program.
There was vitality in this programme, there was an attachment to the mind, there was an attachment to the hearts, and because of this, the time in the middle was very difficult for me.
I was doing something miss every moment and when I talk about my mind, I am, the word is perhaps mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the male is yours, the valour is yours.
was feeling an emptyness
But this Sunday waited a lot
Well, it's got the chance.
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said that they are missing the matter of mind
Sometimes I think it's my own journey to Samashti.
This is my vital journey to Wayam
My silence dialogue with you for me was in a way part of my spiritual journey .
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath
Most people have taken out political meaning from it
For me, that was an opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell you anything else today, but I will definitely do so much that the vacancy that was due to this short break of mind's talk, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given a chance to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I ' ll ever discuss it .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I feel consistently in your efforts to emphasize a positive thing.
The letters that come for the matter of mind, the inputs that are received are absolutely different from the routine government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes a cause of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes a cause of energy .
Sometimes you make some words to edge my thought process
If people keep the challenges faced by the country and the society, then they also explain solutions along with it.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is expressing his resentment towards dirt but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone discusses the environment then he feels the pain, but he also explains the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
Need to incorporate those strengths and talents, to provide opportunities, to implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells that all 130 crore Indians want to join the country's progress with strength and activism. And I would definitely say that I have so many letters in the matter of mind, so many telephone calls come, so many messages are received, but the element of the complaint is very low and somebody has asked for something for himself, such a thing has not come to my notice in the last five years.
When I analysis these things you can imagine how much joy will come to my heart, how much energy will I get
Actually I have not come - you have brought me, you have made me sit and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, let's go ahead with the talk of mind
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to the political scope, it was not limited to politicians, the movement was not limited to bars of jail.
In the Emergency, every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the big election campaign, the rich to the poor, all the people were happy to decide the future of our country.
When something is very close to us, we underestimate its significance, its imageing facts are also ignored.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, city one place
This number may seem very common to us but if I say according to the world, if we leave a China, more than the population of any country in the world had voted in India
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of entire Europe
It introduces the vastness and widespreadness of our democracy
2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in history so far
You can imagine how big resources and manpower are required to complete such elections
Elections were possible by hard work of millions of teachers, officers and employees
In order to successfully conclude this great sacrifice of democracy, where about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces performed their obligations, 20 lakh policemen from different states also laid down their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more than the last time was voted.
Around 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVMs (M) machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines, you can imagine how big it is
All this was done so that it could be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was created for just a woman voter.
Polling station located at the highest altitude in the world is also in India
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Sfiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is another fact that fills the pride in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men
The percentage of voting of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are record 78 women MPs in Parliament
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth several times, not booking, I had requested whether we can give books instead of flowers in welcome.
Since then , people are sufficiently giving books .
However, I could not find a lot of time, but during my stay, I got a chance to read some of his stories again.
His stories encompass the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his drunken name, my mind went on the economic inequalities prevailing in the society itself.
This story of Bir, son of amindar's son Ishwari and poor family, learns that if you are not careful then when the effect of bad confluence goes up, it does not seem to be known.
The second story, who touched my heart, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When Hamid of 4-5 years reaches his grandmother with a spit from the fair, in fact, human sensitivity reaches its peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because there is a great truth of life in it, the child Hamid played a part of old Hamid. Old Amina, the girl had become Amina.
Such a great humorous story is the night of Pus
In this story a live depiction of the irony of a poor farmer life was found .
Turmeric farmer is happy even after his crop is destroyed because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold cold.
Though these stories have been about a century ago, their relevance still feels the same
After reading them, I felt a different kind of feeling
When it's going to be reading, in a media, I was reading about Kerala's letter library
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki
P. K. Murlidharan, teacher of primary school here and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, have worked hard for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling them in the throne and loading them on the back
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children.
Gujarat campaign in Gujarat was a successful experiment
Millions of people from every age group participated in this campaign to read books
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time and place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot and surely write about whatever book you read on the Narendra Modi App so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat will also know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy that the people of our country are thinking about the issues that are a big challenge not only for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your colleagues on Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water is of great importance in our culture
You give your blessings like Mother i . e . Maternity , shower your grace upon us .
Lack of water affects many parts of the country every year
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water that is obtained from rains throughout the year is saved in our country .
I am confident that we will also resolve this crisis with the power, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty crore Indians, just like other problems, with public participation and manpower.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been created in the country keeping the importance of water at the top
This will facilitate faster decisions on all issues related to water
A few days ago I tried to separate something
I wrote a letter to Sarpanchs across the country to Gram Pradhan
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save rain drops of water, they should convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on 22nd of this month, crores of people in thousands of Panchayats donated Shramdan
People in the village resolved to collect one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat program, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch
Listen to what the Sarpanch of Lupung Panchayat of Katkamsandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us all the messages my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
The people there, once again are ready to play their active role for water conservation
My best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, to all the Sarpanchs and to their activism.
There are many Sarpanchs across the country who have taken the initiative of water conservation
In a way it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village have now gathered in their village, like the construction of water temples.
As I said, collective efforts can bring great positive results.
There can be no single formula to deal with water crisis all over the country .
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that's saving water, water conservation
Drainage lines are being corrected in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of water logging
The construction of a tank in Thimmaipalli (Thimaipalli) in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In Kabirdham, Rajasthan, small ponds built in the fields have brought about a major change.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Naga river
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that several such efforts are being made and when we unite and strive firmly, we can make the impossible possible.
When people connect, water will be saved
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am requesting 3 requests from the countrymen.
My first request is as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, just like initiating a mass movement for water conservation.
Together, let us resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is a prasad of God, water is a form of Paras.
First used to say that the touch of Paras becomes iron gold
I say, the water is Paras and the Paras, the touch of water, the new life is created.
Initiate a awareness campaign to save one drop of water
In this, tell about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I especially urge the celebrities of different regions to lead innovative camps for water conservation.
Whether it is a film world or a sports world or be it our friends of the media or be it people associated with social organisations or be it people associated with cultural organisations or be it tales and narrators, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awaken the society, connect the society, join the society
You see, we will see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods have been used for water conservation in our country for centuries.
I urge you all to share those traditional methods of water conservation
If one of you had got the opportunity to go to the birth place of Porbandar, revered Bapu, then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a water storage tank of 200 years old and even today there is water in it and there is a system of preventing rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes to that water tank.
Let us inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more ways connected to water conservation.

My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude to the people of the world for one more thing and also to express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again in Yoga Day, with enthusiasm, three-four generations of one family, together celebrated Yoga Day.
Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has emerged for the Holistic Health Care
Everyone, in every corner of the world, if a Yoga lover welcomes it as soon as the sun rises, then the whole journey of the sun sets.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from A Gyms to Heating Desert, from villages to cities wherever possible, it was not only Yoga but also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known celebrities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive individuals are required to build a healthy society and this ensures Yoga .
Therefore, the propaganda of yoga is a great task of social service.
Should not such a service be respected by recognition
The announcement of Prime Ministers Awards to contribute excellently to the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019 was a matter of great satisfaction for me in itself.
This award has been given to organizations around the world about which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the propaganda of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutes and training courses there or take the name of Italy Ms. Antonietta Roy, who started Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe
These are inspiring examples in itself .
If this is a subject related to yoga, can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honored, has been dedicated to Yoga for the last several decades.
Connecting with your ideas is a very important journey for me . It is a matter of mind .
Let's meet, keep talking
Listen to your emotions, be conscious, understand
Sometimes I try to live those feelings
Keep your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the matter of mind and keep the responsibilities of life
Then once again meet for the matter of mind next month .
Thank you very much to all of you
This weather is also of heat on one side, so somewhere happy is also of gum.
Talk of mind, April 2015
Talk of mind, December 2014
And I have seen that there was no programme for the evils of the government and I believe that in a way there was a jealousy to get out of the problem and because of this, the atmosphere of a good discussion has started, the responsibility of the government has also been sensitized and they feel that they cannot be depressed now. I would like to ask those youngsters who are drunk and drunk.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
These drugs money would go to the terrorists
With these money , terrorists will buy weapons .
And with the same weapons a terrorist will shoot bullets in my country's young man's chest
My country's young man will be martyred
Have you ever imagined that there is a bullet in the chest of a soldier who killed a mother's red, who loves the lives of Mother India, who lives and dies for the country
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their folk progress with our children
Modi ji is not tired
One month is very long .
There are many incidents in the country and the world .
You all celebrated the festival of Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are the festivals that keep enthusiastic in life from time to time, the poor, the rich, the village, the city, the festival has its own greatness in everybody's life.
Sometimes they think that people are useless, people have nothing to do. Our country is the same.
I am talking about my last mind and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking that our country is not like this, the people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I think the country is far ahead, the governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps it is very important for the governments to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I am seeing that these young people are committed to doing something or the other in India, they are exploring opportunities.
and it ' s also doing in its own way .
I said last time, buy at least one khadi clothes.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become Khadidhari . But I got information from the Khadi stores that about one hundred and a half hundred centres of handicrafts and twenty five percent of the sales increased in a week .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from October 2 over the previous year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness. Someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of such a mass movement.
There are many expectations, and should also be.
And I see a good result, cleaning is now being seen in two parts.
One who is old dirt, who is in the grip of dirt, what will the people sitting in the government system do for him
There is a big challenge , but you cannot run away from the responsibility .
All the governments will have to take steps for this responsibility because the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect that is very enjoyable, is enjoyable and is satisfactory to the mind. The common man feels that let's leave the first thing, will not filthy now.
We will not increase the new dirt .
He sent me a mail to Satna, Madhya Pradesh and some of the Shri Bharat Gupta.
He was going to visit his railway, he said his experience. He said that I used to go to the railway even before, this time I went to the railway, but I am seeing that people in every passenger. Railways keep eating and drinking papers, throwing papers. Bole did not throw, not only did he find that there is dustbin in the coach, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , he himself collected his waste in the corner .
He said it was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharatji that he gave me this information .
But I am seeing this that the maximum effect has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families talk about the fact that if our child eats chocolate then he takes the paper immediately .
I had just seen someone in the social media that... someone had written. My hero of today and in my hero today he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone feels that our country, we will not dirty.
We won ' t change the dirt .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, they get somebody to get rid of them immediately.
I consider this auspicious sign .
One good thing is also happening that those people who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life meet me.
Someone talks about cleanliness, someone talks about education, someone discusses social reforms.
Someone is discussing our family life .
I think , otherwise , if a businessman comes first , he will talk to the government about his own interest .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about their selfishness, take some or the other responsibilities related to society.
When I see these things by adding it, I notice that we are moving forward in the direction of a very good change.
If my poor family is not sick , there will never be economic crisis in his life .
If he remains healthy then he will work hard, earn, the family will run.
And therefore my hygiene is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
We can either serve the poor or not we cannot filthy, even if we do not filthy it is good for the poor.
However , I have seen that those who are working in this field are sending me success stories .
But I came to know of two things from my government .
After my advice those officers of the H . . . ministry who felt that we should do something too .
And the officers together planned a plan .
See how the change in the government begins is an example .
Once he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give him special scholarship by fond of such a thousand good specially abilted children .
I congratulate all these officers of the department for their ideas .
I got the opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I spent among the soldiers who died for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because because of them we are celebrating Diwali, so I went among them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they spend their lives.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
Our country ' s soldiers work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity , they are ready to do any courage to protect us .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity to have a tea and drink programme from the youngsters, young students, young women and the winners of our country who had come here in sports.
I got a new energy .
His enthusiasm, zeal, I was seeing that our arrangements and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but rather than complaining, they were talking about doing more than zeal and enthusiasm.
The programme for tea and drinks was very inspiring for me in itself, for these players.
Towards one thing I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say to my mind and my mind.
And I am confident that the countrymen believe in my words, I believe in my intentions.
But today , once again , I want to repeat it from my side .
As far as black money is concerned, black money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your principal servant, this is the Article of Feth for me.
This is my commitment to bring back the money that the poor of India has gone out.
There can be differences in opinion about what the way is, what the method is.
And it is natural in democracy , but I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of what my countrymen understand and what I have .
Today no one knows, neither do I know, nor do you know the government, nor did the previous government know how much money is out.
Everyone keeps telling their own ways, different figures.
I do not want to entangle those figures, my commitment is that it is two rupees, it is five rupees, it is crores, it is billions, it is trillions, it is the money of the poor of the country, it should come back.
And I assure you , there will be no shortage of my efforts .
There will be no scarcity .
Just make me your blessings.
Whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do, I will definitely do it.
This I assure you .
I have received a letter .
Mr . Abhishek has come from Parikh .
Even when I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this kind of feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter with your mind .
I agree with his pain .
When I talk about the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely discuss these drugs, these drug mafia and the big crisis of India's young money for the next time.
If you have some experience in this regard, you have some information, you have some information about this, if you have saved the children with this addiction, if you have some kind of ways to save yourself, if you have played a good role, if you give me such information, then I will convey to the people of the country these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should go on this path due to frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handing over topics in which the government first comes to the dockyard .
But how long will we keep hiding things
I am also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were telling us that suggest us on face books, show on tweeters, send e-mails.
But there are very large sections of the country, who do not have this or what to do.
Your point is right .
This facility is not with everyone .
So I tell you that if you want to say something about my mind, then you listen to me on the village-village radio, you will also send a letter to Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani, Parliament Marg, New Delhi, if you give some suggestions then you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because active citizens are the biggest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you are very active.
To talk about my mind, your mind should also be added.
You may definitely write a letter .
I will try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 a.m.
So I ' m increasing the facility to reach you .
Gradually the beginning of cold is happening .
There is a good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Please use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi.
My best wishes to all of you on Vijayadashmi.
I will try, if possible, I will talk to you twice a month or once in a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, it will happen on Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also be comfortable and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in delivering my mind to you.
The festival of Vijayadashmi, which celebrates today, is the festival of victory over evils.
But a gentleman of Shri Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, he sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayadashmi we resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to him for this suggestion.
Everyone must have won the victory by defeating the evils within themselves, but as a nation, I feel that on the auspicious festival of Vijayadashmi, we all resolve to get rid of dirt and we can make these resolutions on the festival of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will clean themselves and upload their video in social media and invite more than nine people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the talk of khadi comes very naturally in mind.
You know our own scientists successfully used Mars to reach at least costs, successfully.
There is no shortage of strength, only we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
I remember one thing that Swami Vivekanandji used to say, Swami Vivekananda used to always tell one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He said hey, what are you doing
You're a lion.
They have made me big.
Look at my voice, look at my conversation.
So the lion said that let me show who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and said to him with his own face - Look, the face of both of us is one.
I am also a lion, you are a lion and as soon as he got self-respected from within him, he also started roaming like that lion, the lion that grows among the sheep.
The elements inside him awakened.
Swami Vivekanandji used to say this.
My countrymen, 125 crore Indians have immense strength and immense potential.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognise the strength within us and then as Swami Vivekanandji had said, we will be victorious and our nation will also be victorious.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional and inspiring event of my life.
God has probably liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the entire nation.
Later, I had become emotional touch that I used to do different Olympics for specially abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come, their parents used to come and I used to go myself.
An atmosphere of faith was created and that is why I like to share with you the suggestions of Gautam Pal that he has given.
A story comes to me even more attention.
If you knew why did not you tell
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we do not stand ourselves, even those who show the path will not be found.
We will not get to catch the finger and run.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that 125 crore are certainly capable of walking, will continue.
Many suggestions that have come to me for a few days, people send big interesting suggestions.
Some people have said that when they start small industries, the process of registration should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for him.
Some people have written to me and sent me children should teach skill development from class VIII.
Someone has written to me that there should be dust beans within every hundred meters, if you have to arrange cleanliness.
Some people have written to me and sent me that the polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I would like to tell you that if you send me a truth incident anywhere, whoever is a positive person, who inspires me, whoever inspires the countrymen, if you send me such true incidents with evidence then I will definitely talk about my mind, I will definitely send those things that have touched my mind to the countrymen.
This is the only intention of talking to me. Come on, let us serve our Mother India together.
We take the country to new heights.
As you come to mind, I will definitely keep talking to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came in my mind today.
Whenever I meet you on Sunday, I will meet at 11 o'clock in the morning but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will remain.
If you also want to tell me something after listening to me, definitely send me, I would like it.
I felt very good today you all talked about and radio is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest of the poor, because my country's strength is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers, sisters and youngsters, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I express confidence.
You have faith in your power, so I believe in the future of India.
Starting the talk of mind today is full of mind
10 days ago, India-Mata lost their brave sons
These brave heroes, we supplied ourselves to protect hundred and fifty million Indians
The countrymen could sleep comfortably, so these brave sons had kept them together by night and day.
In the terrorist attack of Pulwama, after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, people across the country and in the minds of people, there is trauma and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families, all around
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives in the defense of Mother India.
This challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget casteism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger than ever before, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour .
In order to establish peace where they have shown magnificent capabilities , the same attackers have also worked to respond in their own language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack
Army has taken a resolution to destroy the terrorists and their helpers
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational things that have emerged from their families through the media have further emphasized the zeal of the whole country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, also inspires us all in this hour of grief.
They said , " They will send their other sons to fight against enemies , and if necessary , they will go to fight . "
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagat Singh Pur of Odisha
He has also pledged to join his only son RPO
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoreen, wrapped in the tricolor, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, the innocent son said that I will also go to the army.
The tone of this innocent expresses the spirit of children and children of India today.
Such feelings are being seen in the houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
One of our brave martyrs is not an exception, their family is not an exception
Whether it is the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the parents of Kangra's martyr Tilakraj or the six-year-old son of Kota's martyr Hemraj, the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would request the younger generation to know and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
What happens to patriotism, what happens to sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old events of history.
In front of our eyes, these are a living example and this is the reason for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, for such a long time of independence, all of us who were waiting for the war memorial is going to end now.
The curiosity and curiosity of the countrymen about this is very natural
Omkar Shetty ji of Udupi, Karnataka on Narendra ModiApp expresses his happiness at the National War Memorial being ready
I was also surprised and pained that there was no National War Memorial in India
A memorial where the bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there must be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Yesterday, on February 25, we will deliver crores of countrymen to this national military memorial, to our army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
A new monument has been built just near Delhi's heart, the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present.
I am sure it will be like visiting the National Military Memorial for the countrymen to a pilgrimage .
The National Military Memorial symbolizes the gratitude of the nation towards the supreme sacrifices made by the soldiers after independence
The design of the monument reflects the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers
The concept of the National Military Memorial is focused on our centric ircles i.e. four cycles, where the journey from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom is depicted.
The flame of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyred soldier
The second is Circle Veerta Chakra which shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers .
This is a gallery where the bravery of the soldiers on the walls has been engraved
After this, the renunciation cycle demonstrates the sacrifice of Circle soldiers
In this, the names of the soldiers who sacrificed the supreme sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters
After this the protector cycle displays security
This circle has a row of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and are conveying the message to the citizens of the country that the soldiers are deployed on the border and the countrymen are safe
Overall, the identification of the National Military Memorial will be made as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude, to research them.
Here is the story of those sacrifices who have sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed .
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in words in the development of the country.
In October last year, I was fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the country.
That was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to those men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go there share your pictures on social media so that others also get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this sacred place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat, I get to read through different means.
This time when I was reading your comment I noticed a very interesting comment of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that on March 3, Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also there.
And they write further , these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In a way to pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is like bowing down to the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have not increased the name of the whole country of Jharkhand .
The whole country is grateful for their contribution .
Today, if our youngsters need an inspirational personality for guidance, then that is Lord Birsa Munda
And the British hid them , cleverly , when they were asleep .
Do you know why they resorted to such a cowardly action
Because the British who raised such a big empire were also afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had only shaken the English rule equipped with guns and guns with his traditional arrows.
Indeed, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people is huge on the power of weapons.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for the political freedom of the British but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals
They did all this in their smaller life
In the life full of darkness of the deprived and exploited, shine like sun
Lord Birsa Munda made his sacrifice at a young age of 25 years
The son of Mother India like Birsa Munda has happened in every part of the country
Perhaps any corner of India will be such that no one has contributed to this war of freedom that lasted for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, bravery and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If, a personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a big institution
Jamshedji Tata was a visionary in true sense, who not only saw the future of India but also laid the strong foundation of it.
He knew that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is necessary for the future.
Not only this, he also established several world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February
as you all know that this day comes once in 4 years
Morarji Bhai, rich in comfortable, peaceful personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country
The record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai .
Morarji Desai took the skilled leadership of India at a difficult time when the country's democratic fabric was in danger.
Morarji Bhai Desai shook himself in a movement against the Emergency to protect democracy
For this he had to pay a huge price even in old age .
The government of that time arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure, 44th Constitution Amendment was brought
This is important because the 42nd amendment that was brought during the Emergency, in which the powers of the Supreme Court were reduced and other provisions that violated our democratic values were returned
For example, through the 44th Amendment, provision for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies was made in newspapers
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in the same amendment also provides that fundamental rights received under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution can not be violated even during the Emergency.
For the first time it was arranged that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet, the President would announce the Emergency, and it was also decided that the period of Emergency could not be extended to more than six months at a time.
In this way Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in 1975 by implementing the Emergency, it could not be repeated in the future.
His invaluable contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy will always be remembered for generations to come
Once again I pay my tribute to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, this time also there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Award.
Today we are moving towards a New India. In this, we want to respect those people who are doing their jobs at the grassroot level with a passionate sense.
We are making positive changes in the lives of others in different ways on the strength of our hard work.
In fact, they are true karmayogis who are selfless in public service, social service and above all
You must have seen that when the Padma award is announced , people ask who it is
In a way I consider it a very big success because these are people who are not on the front pace of T. . , magazine or newspapers
They are away from the world of miracles, but they are people who do not care about their name, just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : He won the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita in a way .
I want to tell you about some such people
You must have heard about the Daitari Nayak of Odisha, he is not called Janal Man of the Disha, Daitari Nayak cut the mountain with his hands in his village and made a canal for three kilometers. With his hard work, the problem of irrigation and water ended forever.
Take Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive Kutch's traditional rogan painting
They are doing a great job to bring this rare painting to a new generation
I had gifted the Tree of Life Art made by Abdul Gafur to former US President Barack Obama
Among the Padma awardees, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of cow-mata
The way he spent his entire life in the service of Gaumata , this is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and exploited through the Kalanjium Movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated a community based small financial system
At the age of 100, he is training yoga to people around the world and has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers so far.
Famous Jamuna Tudu, known as Dadi Taran in Jharkhand, did the courageous task of taking iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forests from destruction but united ten thousand women to protect trees and wildlife
This is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today the village people plant 10 trees on the marriage of 18 trees and girl at the birth of every child
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dalli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being disabled, it is difficult to find such an example that he did for the upliftment of Divyang women, by establishing an institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the auspicious work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of the farmer aunt of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, i.e. the story of Rajkumari Devi is very inspiring
He has presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making farming profitable
Kisan Aunt added 300 women in his area to Self Help Group and inspired to make financially self-reliant
He trained the women of the village as well as other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with farming and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time that the Padma awards given this year have given 12 farmers the Padma awards.
Usually very few people associated with the agricultural world and very few people who do direct farming have come to the list of Padma Shri
This is a living picture of the changing India in itself.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you all about a heart-touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays wherever I am going in the country, my effort is to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme PM-JAY i. e.
He was treated by this scheme and he became a healthy head of the house, a person who took care of his family by working hard work, was unable to work. This scheme benefited him and he became healthy and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, About 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big change is happening in the lives of the poor
If you all know any poor person who is not able to treat in the absence of money , tell him about this scheme .
Different Education Boards across the country to start the process for testing of tenth and twelfth class boards in the next few weeks
I extend my warm greetings to all the students who are examining their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event of discussion on examination in Delhi took place in Town Hall's Format
One of the features of the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that can definitely be beneficial for students .
If all the students, their teachers and parents can see the recording of this entire program on YouTube, then best wishes to all my team winners for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it is not possible to talk about India and not to talk about festivals.
Hardly there is no day in our country which does not have any importance, which does not have any festival
because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture
A few days later, the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, its special significance is covered in our minds and temples .
He was discussing many subjects and his confidence was really impressing - inspiring
During the interaction, when I was talking to a wise young man from him, he said, "I am a stage artist, I do mimicry in entertainment programs, so I asked the same way, whom do you miscry
So he told me that I miscrypt the Prime Minister
So I said to them , " Show me a little , and I was very pleasant surprising , " the way they talked about the matter of the mind , the whole microscrire of it , and the word of the mind .
I am very good to hear that people not only listen to mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I really was very impressed by the power of that Divyang young man
My dear countrymen, connecting all of you through Mann Ki Baat programme has been a unique experience for me.
through radio , I ' m going to have millions of families every month in a way
Many times I feel like you have accepted me as part of your family, reading your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone.
It's a very pleasant feeling for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy
Next two months, we will all be busy in the election
I myself will also be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May, all the feelings that we have for three months, I will start with the strength of your blessings with a new belief after the election and I will talk to you for years through Mann Ki Baat.
Once again, I thank you very much with my heart.
Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji, Doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math in Tumkur district in Karnataka was not among us
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas i.e. doing hard work is like fulfilling his obligations, the residence of Lord Shiva, being in Kailash Dham
His fame was as a scholar who had a wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He put his whole life in the fact that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
This was a priority for the welfare of the farmers in every way.
Siddhaganga Math regularly organized animals and agricultural fairs .
I have been fortunate to get the blessings of the ultimately revered Swamiji several times.
In 2007, our former President, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, visited Tumkur on the occasion of Centenary Celebrations of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for revered Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of all your actions.Doctor Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji and the mission of Siddhaganga Math in a beautiful way.
Once again, I offer my respect to such a great man.
On 25th January, the Election Commission was the foundation day, which is celebrated as National Voters Day, National Oters Day
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale at which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission by seeing the excellent manner in which the Election Commission is organising it.
There is no stone unturned to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, has a registered voter, gets an opportunity to vote.
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they hear these things .
Keeping in mind that one voter, that voter gets the opportunity to use his franchise, for this, the entire team of EC staff goes to far-flung areas and arranges for voting - and that is the best of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for striving to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that young people born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
There is an opportunity for them to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to become part of the decision-making process in the country
The time has come to connect the dreams of the country with the dreams of the country
I urge the younger generation to register themselves if they are eligible to vote.
It is my duty to vote together - this feeling should grow within us.
For any reason in life, if you can not vote, then there should be great pain.
Sometimes there should be some misunderstanding in the country.
I urge the celebrities of the country to make people aware about the fact that we all have to collectively voter registration or vote on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is polytheistic
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to India's freedom struggle.
You know that so far many such rooms and buildings were closed from independence inside the Red Fort.
The locked Red Fort rooms have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and III.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history is settled
Talking about the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle, inspires us to go inside the history of the museum.
At this place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa, Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbakhsh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were prosecuted by the British rule.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, in the Kranti Temple, then the family members of Netaji presented me a very special cap and hat.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the hat in the museum, so that the people coming there should also see that hat and inspire patriotism from it.
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of his heroes needs to be consistently conveyed to the new generation again and again .
Just a month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised, because there is only a tradition on August 15.
This was the opportunity to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizer
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom
Come to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with shouting slogans
It has been demanding for several years that files related to Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we can do this thing.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we spoke a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose
I am happy that efforts have been made to develop many places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and that too, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered the radio as an important means of connecting with the people, similarly Netaji had a very deep relationship with the radio and he also chose the radio to communicate with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations, weekly news bulletins were also broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The programmes to be broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to the warriors of our freedom struggle
A visual art museum has also been built in this Kranti Mandir .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical hehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and artworks of three centuries old .
The museum has exhibited excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Verma, Avninder Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to visit there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji
Now you may be wondering that the talk is happening here and I am talking to you to see the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore .
So far you have to go to Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to most of his works .
He believed that the one who saw his painting himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in the painting from his perspective
Their paintings have also been displayed in European countries, in Russia and in the United States.
I hope you will definitely visit his paintings at the Kranti Mandir
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints
Our saints have given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
There was such a saint - Saint Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
Sant Ravidas ji ' s two are very famous .
Saint Ravidas ji used to give greatest messages through a few lines
He had said that there is a caste in caste, which is the leaf of Ketan, the raidas man can not join unless the caste is split upon the banana stem, then the leaf under the leaf then leaves below the leaf and in the end nothing comes out, but the whole tree ends, in the same way man has also been divided into castes and humans have not been there.
They used to say that if God is really in every human being, it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his messages
It would not be wrong to say that they have explained to the world the real meaning of labour reputation .
They used to say that if you want to mind then the Ganga in Kathauti i . e . if your mind and heart are sacred then God lives in your heart .
Sant Ravidas ji's messages have influenced the people of every section, every section, whether it is the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or Mirabai, everyone was his followers.
I once again salute Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and think ahead of the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate the message given to you, especially to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to numerous young scientists of the country.
We are proud that today the satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space.
Kalam set made by our students on 24th January has been launched
Sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made many records
As many space missions have been launched since independence in 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft
We will soon register India's presence on the moon through Handriyaan-2 campaign
Our country is also using space technology to protect our lives.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all these are getting a lot of help from space technology.
NAI devises have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their safety as well as economic growth.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services
Around 40 lakh households from 23 States have been geo-tagged under Housing for All.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It contributes to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative, which has also gifted development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches not only the satellites of developing countries but also of developed countries.
Skies and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space program gives children an opportunity to think big and move ahead of the boundaries that were considered impossible till now.
This is the vision of inspiring our children to look at stars as well as discover new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that the sportspersons who are playing and this time in Khelo India, many young and young players have come forward to play.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports is strong, that is, when our base is strong, our youth will be able to perform the best of their capabilities in the country and the world.
This time, players from every state have performed well at their respective levels in Khelo India.
The life of many players who win medals is inspiring.
They live in a parking shade with their family
At the same time, Maharashtra's Under-21 woman Kaddi team captain Sonali is a resident of Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at very young age and his brother and his mother promoted Sonali's skill
Often it is observed that daughters do not get much encouragement in sports like kabaddi .
Despite this, Sonali chose Kaddi and performed excellent performance
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shaw is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
A farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani Kamati wins Gold in Weightlitting
He credited his victory to his father, his father is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we are talking about the creation of India, it is the resolution of youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India tell us that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India, but also the youth and children coming from small towns, villages, towns and youth sporting talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty festivals
But have you heard about the toilet brightening contest
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest that has been running for nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilet
People are making their toilets clean and making them beautiful by making some paintings, you will also get to see the clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kutch to Kamrup on all photographs social media.

With the help of the people of India, India is moving towards open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary
The audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed immensely to this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat and that is why you all are happy to share that more than 5 lakh 50 thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and Swachhta Coverage has crossed 98 in rural India and about 9 crore families have been provided toilets.

Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
Here he demonstrated his determination towards justice .
I would like to say today that when we listen to the words of Mann Ki Bak, one thing that touches my mind, the maximum people said that when we listen to the minds of all the people of our family then it feels that the head of our family is sharing our own things with us by sitting in the middle of us, when I heard this thing in a broad way that I am amongst you, I am among you, I am among you, I am among you, you all have made me big and in a way I will also be associated with you through the medium of Mann Ki Bak, I will also be associated with you with your happiness and sorrow, your aspirations, my ambitions, my ambitions and my ambitions.

Not only this, our Sikkim has won this award by defeating 51 nominated policies of 25 countries, for this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this award. My dear countrymen, on the end of October, a lot of change is being felt in the weather and along with the change of weather, the auspicious weather of festivals has come.
