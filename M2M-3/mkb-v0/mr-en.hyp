Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Enemy Budhivinashai Deepajyotirnamostute
I salute such Divya Jyoti.
What could be the best idea to remember Deepawali, let us pray for lighting everywhere, spreading positiveness and ending the spirit of enmity.
Today, Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is participating in this but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organisations there celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way, India realizes there.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world has its own attraction.
Our India, which is a country of festivals, has immense potential for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, we should try to participate in the joy of festivals in other states and other countries by spreading such festivals.
We have such different festivals in every state, in every region - people from other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in enhancing the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, we have decided to do something different in this Diwali.
I was saying: Let us all celebrate this Diwali, the women's strength and the excellent success that we have achieved, that is the honor of Lakshmi of India.
Immediately after this, there were innumerable inspirational stories in the social media.
Kodipka Ramesh in Warangal wrote on Namo App: My mother is my power.
When my elders died in 1990, my mother took responsibility for five children.
Today, we are in five good businesses.
Ramesh ji, my salute to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for him, Major Khushboo is India's Lakshmi, who is the daughter of a bus driver and he was leading all the women's groups of Assam Rifles.
Kavita Tiwari ji is the daughter of Lakshmi of India who is also his power.
He is proud that his daughter makes a good painting.
He has also achieved a very good category in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain has written that a 92-year-old woman is providing free water to the passengers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghalaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Lakshmi in India.
Many such stories have been told by the people.
You must read and inspire and do some similar work in your surroundings.
I salute all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honma, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the word that we are speaking about every Lakshmi of India, it seems that the foundation stone was laid in the 17th century.
How beautiful words, how beautiful feelings and how excellent ideas are in this poem in Kannada.
Our daughters are our pride and because of the importance of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and that is the bright future.
My dear countrymen, 12th November, 2019 is the day on which the 550th Light Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated around the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but in the entire world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world, who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can never forget my visit to the gurudwaras of Venkuwar and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, whom I can tell you, but for that it will take several parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service in the highest place.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believes that no one can value the service of the selfless emotions.
He stood firmly against socially evil practices like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji gave his message to the world, far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers of our times.
And wherever they went, they won their hearts due to their humility, humility and simpleness.
Guru Nanak Devji made several important religious visits which are called sadness.
With the message of goodwill and equality, they met people, saints and sages everywhere, whether it is north or south or east or west.
It is believed that the famous Saint Shankardev of Assam had also inspired him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water problem there.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar, who always remembers us, is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji traveled north, Kashmir and its surroundings.
This led to a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet, where the people considered him a Guru.
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan, where they had gone.
During one of his sadness, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Those millions of people who followed their teachings and are still doing their beliefs.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassadors of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and this was the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers visited the Golden Temple and also got the opportunity to know about the Sikh traditions and culture.
Thereafter, many ambassadors put photographs on social media and wrote pridefully about good experiences.
I wish that the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will inspire us to bring their ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that this date of 31st October will be in memory of all of you.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India, who was a great hero who encamped the country in the threshold of unity.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a unique potential to bring people together, while on the other hand, he had a good deal with those with whom he had ideological differences.
Sardar Patel used to go deep and look at small things.
In fact, it was the Man of Details, who had the request of Tapsil.
At the same time, he was a specialist in organization skills.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Patel was responsible for all the arrangements for the session.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system to the city.
It has been decided that no one will have water shortage.
Moreover, he was also cautious of going to the shoes or shoes of a representative at the venue of the session and you would be surprised to know that Sardar Patel had said.
He urged the farmers to make khadi crops in contact with them.
Farmers made crops and sold representatives.
Wearing our shoes in these cattle and keeping that cattle with you, the tension of the delegates going to steal the shoes.
On the other hand, the sale of khadi has increased significantly.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the Constituent Assembly.
They have taken important tasks to ensure basic rights, so that there is no scope to discriminate on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a great Bhagirath and historical work to integrate institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai was the specialty that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in the integration of the country was discussed.
He told Mudaliar Bhai, Arkot Ramaswamy Mudaliar and Arkot Laxmanaswamy Mudaliar that he should take the people of Trivankor to travel immediately and throw the tricolor there and first tricolor in Lakshadweep.
Immediately after his order, the tricolor was hoisted and the neighbouring country's minds were destroyed to gain control over Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that he should ensure that Lakshadweep will get all necessary support for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing significantly to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope you will travel to these beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the statue of unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the country and to the world on 31st October, 2018.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
The statue of the freedom god in the United States is twice the height of it.
The tallest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian's honour was rough.
You will be happy that in a year, more than 26 lakh tourists went to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday about eight and a half thousand people will see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his belief and faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and now there are several attraction centres like select gardens, butterfly gardens, forest safaris, nutrition food parks for children, Ekta Nursery etc. which are continuously developing and encouraging the local economy and providing new employment opportunities to the people.
Considering the conveniences of the visitors, the people of several villages are providing home-step facilities to their homes.
Professional training is also being provided to those who provide hostel facilities at home.
I am confident that the people of the state have started dragon fruit farming and soon it will become the main source of livelihood for the people.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, the effigy of unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses of the development of a place in a year, a world famous tourist destination.
There people come from the country and abroad.
Several systems such as transportation, camps, guides, environmental supplementary systems are developing on their own.
There is a huge economic activity and people are creating facilities according to the needs of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, In the last month, the Time Month has led to the effigy of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you all will take some time out of your precious time to see the statue of unity.
But I urge every Indian who takes time to visit at least 15 tourist destinations in India to travel with families, to stay at night wherever he goes.
Friends, As you know, from 2014 every year 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day.
This day gives us a message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any price.
On 31st October, the Run for Unity - Ekta Runch is being organised every year.
In this, people from every section of the society, from every level will be involved.
Run for Unity is a reflection of the fact that this country is one, is moving in one direction and is looking forward to achieving a goal.
And nowadays, people are seeing a version of marathon.
Run for Unity is also the same.
We are connected to Fit India and with the objectives of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
And because of this, not only the body but the mind and the culture of India have to run to take India to a new height.
For this, you can get information about the Run for Unity around you in the cities where you live.
In this portal, the Run for Unity will be organised across the country.
All of you will run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for your own health
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel built the country in the throne of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a culture in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every juncture, at every juncture, at every juncture, at every juncture, in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been extremely active and alert to empower the unity and harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its results on the birthplace of Ram.
Just remember that day, how was the atmosphere
How many people of different types came to the ground.
How interest groups used to play games to take advantage of that situation.
What kind of language was used to feed the atmosphere .
Attempts were also being made to fill bitterness in different voices.
On the one hand, there was a lot of shock to feed the atmosphere for two weeks, but when the results came to Ram Janmabhoomi, the government, the political parties, the social organisations, the representatives of the civil society, the sadhusantani gave a very restraint reaction.
Try to reduce tension in the environment .
But I still remember that day.
It should always be kept in mind that it gives us a lot of strength.
This is the example of the sound of unity and the strength of the country.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed on 31st October.
I pay homage to the country today.
My dear countrymen, today there will be a story of one story in every village from far off places, from north to south, from east to west, from every corner of India, from every corner of the country, from every corner of the country, from every corner of the country, that is cleanliness.
Every individual, every family, every village feels comfortable about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
Their consequences are also 125 crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I heard that I would like to tell you that.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature slides from 50 to 60 degrees.
In the air the name of pranavish is called .
Staying in such a difficult situation is not even less than valour.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are stretching their chests and protecting the borders of the country but are running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the people of the country for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that some disorders are also difficult.
In such a situation, it is an important task to remove and manage waste.
In such a scenario, 130 tons of waste can be removed from the glaciers and its surroundings and that too, in such a soft environment.
We all know that Siachen is a part that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the meaning of running a cleanliness campaign here is to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower parts and also to use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shuk.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a new consciousness awakening in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, something or the other is being bought from the market.
The more we try to buy local things, the more Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity.
And I urge that we should buy something made by the handicrafts of our weavers and the handicrafts of our Khadiwala.
Even in this Diwali, we would have bought a lot before Diwali.
But there will be a lot of people who think that if they go after Diwali then they will get a little cheaper.
There will be many such people whose shopping is still there.
While wishing Deepawali, I would like to urge you to buy local items and buy local items.
See how important the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi can play.
But sometimes there is a fire when they are careless.
Somewhere there is wound .
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, whether it is any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians of India celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We recalled the target of hostility attacks in 2016, when our soldiers gave a smooth answer to those who were hiding from the guise of terrorism.
Our armed forces and exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country so that the maximum citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can know their capabilities.
You can know how capable we are and how we protect our countrymen by putting our soldiers on their lives.
On the occasion of Parakram Parv, I remind the youngsters of the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces and also inspire us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of Shuruvira.
It is certain that our soldiers will give a fair answer to those who try to eliminate the atmosphere of peace and progress in our country.
We believe in peace and we are committed to promote it, but not with respect and with respect the value of sovereignty of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a valour of our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, India is one of the countries that send maximum number of soldiers to different peacekeeping forces.
Our soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
My dear countrymen, the matter of the sky is different.
One of the people's excitements in the Republic Day programme is Fly Past in which their air force directs leopard air and shows their capabilities.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistani attacker launched an indirect attack, the Air Force also confirmed that Indian soldiers and materials would reach the battlefield on time to protect Srinagar.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom fighter of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in relieving Kargil from bribery in 1999.
On Tiger Hill, the Air Force smoked them with dust rains at the hostels of the enemy.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable performance of these brave soldiers of our Air Force.
Their work is unique to tackle natural disasters from floods to forest fires and to help the countrymen.
The Air Force has also set an ideal in ensuring the equality of men and women in the country and has opened the doors of every department for the girls.
Now the Air Force is giving the option of Short Service Commission as well as the Permanent Commission which I had announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that along with male power in our Armed Forces, the same contribution is being made by women power.
Now women are getting armed as well.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one of our naval officers, Abhilash Tommy, was bowing to life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save them.
You all know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave officer.
He is the first Indian officer who travels in the world with a small name from any modern technology.
For the last 80 days, he was awakening his pace in the sea to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the devastating maritime cyclone created a crisis in front of him but this brave Indian Navy continued to shout in the sea for several days.
I pray for Abhilas Tommy's good health and that is why this courage, his valour, his determination and the incomparable strength to win will inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, Children also know what is the significance of this day on October 2 for our country.
On 2nd October this year, there is another special significance.
Two years from now on, we will celebrate several events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or a great personality like Nelson Mandela, everyone has gained strength in Gandhi's thoughts and has been able to give a long fight to our people for equality and respect.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important work of our revered Bapu, which more and more people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, in 1945, when he emphasized the freedom struggle, he prepared a revised answer to these ideas.
Revered Bapus, farmers, villages, the rights of the workers, the cleanliness and the spread of education have been kept before the countrymen.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a collection of people.
It was Bapu's characteristic that connecting people and mixing them with them.
Everyone had ever experienced their unique features.
He gave everyone the experience that the person is the most important and essential for the country.
This is the biggest contribution of the freedom struggle that they have made this struggle a mass movement.
Replying to Mahatma Gandhi's call for the freedom struggle, every region of the society, every section of the society humbled themselves.
Bapu gave you all an inspirational mantra.
So, can he get control over his life and part
Can crores of people get self-esteem, those who are hungry and their souls are hungry
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and ego has started ending.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, their increasing economic strength, increasing purchasing power, if we buy something, can we remember Bapu for a moment
Whoever is fortunate, whoever will be benefitted directly or indirectly.
I will be more happy if the poorest of the poor benefits.
Keeping in mind the mantra of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that in the days to come, when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that we should build some country in our shopping and those who have sweated our sweat, their money and their talent should benefit in some form or the other.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji and this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that this small step can make a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest.
But this was achieved, India got freedom.
Similarly, today we can feel that with this small task, I can contribute to the economic progress of my country, to the economic empowerment of my country, to the fight against poverty.
This is the true patriotism in today's era, it is the work of revered Bapu.
He said that all these khadi clothes have been prepared with a lot of hard work, every thread of it should be done.
The spirit of intimacy towards the country and affection towards the people of the country was enshrined in this childhood of the great man.
Two days later, along with the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri ji.
With the name of Shastriji, the feeling of unbreakable faith in the minds of our Indians is blossoming.
His compassionate personality is always a matter of pride for every countrymen.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri is that he looks very humble from outside but he is determined as a mountain.
His announcement Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is a recognition of his vast personality.
This was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that in the short term of nearly one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today we remember revered Bapu, it is natural that we will not remain without talking about cleanliness.
Swachhta Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this event and I got the privilege of Shramdan with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to a school where the foundation stone was laid by the revered Babasaheb.
People from all over the country participated in the Shramdaan on 15th.
Heriri also participated in this.
School students, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Private Industries, etc.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the entire world.
India is organizing the largest Global Sanitation Convention in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers from all over the world and experts from all over the world are collectively demonstrating their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The conclusion of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
My dear countrymen, in Sanskrit, there is a saying that justice is just at the root of the self-esteem, when justice is discussed, the spirit of human rights is inserted in it.
It is especially essential to ensure the freedom, peace and justice for the deprived and deprived people.
The Constitution provided by Babasaheb Ambedkar provides for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993.
NHRC will complete 25 years in a few days.
NHRC has worked to enhance human dignity along with protecting human rights.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clarified that human rights are not a concept for us.
The symbol of our National Human Rights Commission has engraved all the Bhawantu Sukhin of Vedic periods.
NHRC has created a comprehensive awareness about human rights and has also played a commendable role in preventing misuse of human rights.
During this 25-year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I believe that this is a hopeful thing for a healthy society and for a better democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been set up along with the national level human rights work.
It is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas that we need to know the importance and conduct of human rights as a society.
Even this year, with your endeavour, organise Run for Unity in your villages, cities and cities.
Run for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I urge you all on 31st October to strengthen our efforts to enhance every section of the society and every part of the country in the form of unity through the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasions of Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, Rakhi Purnima is being celebrated throughout the country.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and belief among the brothers and sisters.
Now Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
On the other hand, the horse, horse, palanquin, jay Kanhaiyalal ki Govinda-Govinda will be filled with the atmosphere.
The enjoyment of being colored in the color of Lord Krishna is very charming .
Sir, Add Sanskrit-Dinamasti
Sanskrit languages, Sarla, It is Sarve Vedanti.
Brothers and sisters, along with Raksha Bandhan, Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
We are also proud that from Vedas to present Sanskrit languages have played a very important role in spreading knowledge.
In Sanskrit language and literature of this language, knowledge is a storehouse of every field of life.
Not only this, the mantras that give a comprehensive answer are also mentioned in Sanskrit.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattoor in Shivmoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit language to speak.
It will be surprising to know that one of the specialities of Sanskrit language can create new words in this language.
It has been said in a clear renowned renunciation that how important the guru name is in life, that although the alphabet , the guru : the disciples , the guru , the guru , the guru .
My dear countrymen, seasonal rain brings new hopes to our farmers who have worked hard and hard work.
Due to extreme heat, the rains become a boon for sand, dried trees and plants and frozen reservoirs.
But sometimes it brings hyper-storm disastrous and catastrophic metropolis.
There has been heavy rains in comparison to other places in the country.
I pray that the people who have been injured in this natural calamity improve their nature as soon as possible.
But in the times of such a crisis, we are seeing humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody helps the oppressors, whether in Kerala or in any other district or region of India.
He made tireless efforts to save the lives of the people stuck in the flood.
Whether it is the air force, the naval, the armed forces, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RAF, the armed forces have played a very important role in rescue and relief operations.
Let us pray that in this sacred time of Onam, the country, especially Kerala, will get the strength to come out of this crisis as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala gets a great speed.
On behalf of all the countrymen, once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the people of the country who have suffered such a surge, that the entire country is with you in such a situation.
He had gone far away from active politics for the last ten years.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that even after these ten years, the common man of India had immense affection for Atal ji.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has led to two significant changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States has been limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the Anti-Pakistan Act was one-third to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been made to disqualify the members of the Parties.
Atalji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for presenting the countrys budget was changed in the House.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time for presenting the budget in Parliament to 11 in the morning.
Some of the rules of the Code have made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
More and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their flag.
Atal ji has done the great task of bringing our favourite tricolor to the common man.
On the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, people are expressing their opinions.
I pay homage to all of you by reaffirming the resolve of fulfilling the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh heard just five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
In Rajasthan too, the courts have taken immediate decisions on the cases of atrocities against women in the same manner.
This law will play an effective role in preventing the cases of atrocities against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
In this Monsoon Session of Parliament, all the members have added an ideal objective.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country at the public level.
My dear countrymen, the attention of millions of Indians is now on the Asian Games that are going on.
Asian sports are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
The number of medal winners has increased for the country, particularly our companions are involved in it, which gives a very positive indication.
Let us focus on our health because a healthy, healthy country can build a prosperous and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your feelings.
Everybody is surprised to see the Rani Ki Baw built in the eleventh century in Patna in Gujarat.
The land of India is like a laboratory of engineering.
Several engineers of India have come to know that it is possible only in imagination.
We have got one such ritual in our tradition that shares the legacy of great engineers.
This is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishwaswaraiah.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefiting lakhs of farmers and the common man.
It is called Bhunga in Kutch.
My households have seen 3-3 earthquakes.
I have experienced three earthquakes in this house myself.
But go inside and see that you do not see any harms.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature and geographical structure and the environment here.
After seeing the house, I thought that even before several ages, the engineers of that period had thought of the local situation and had studied how the houses were built in accordance with it, so that the common man could be safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also think of the future.
Workshops should be taken everywhere.
What new things should we learn in the changing times
What things should be taught to people
How to connect
Nowadays disaster management has become a big task.
The whole world has to face natural crisis.
In such a situation, how can a new form of structural engineering be
How will it have different courses
What should the student class learn in this
Many such things should be considered at the time when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
At the same time, the preparations for Diwali will also start.
You will be meeting in Mann Ki Baat and will continue to speak in Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we will continue to work towards taking our country forward from the whole heart.
With this feeling, my best wishes to all of you.
The citizens of some parts are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is vast and there is a diversity in it, but in this country sometimes the king of Varun also shows the form of his favourites.
In such a situation, we have the most important responsibility that we all should become the protector of nature, the protector of nature and the enrichment of nature.
If we become nature friendly then the balance of natural things will be achieved by ourselves.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually it takes usually a few hours to return to that cave .
After remembering that they didn't come out now, they took shelter at a slight height in the cave.
But they didn't have a day or two but they had to stay within 18 days.
We can now imagine how their moments and moments have gone in the mental condition when there is a direct death in front.
On the one hand, these children used to humble their hands with a crisis and on the other hand, humanity in the whole world was united and demonstrating the human quality of God.
Especially after seeing everybody's very restraint behaviour, I feel that this is a learning and understanding quality.
Those whose children were stuck inside, their parents did not feel sorry or their mother did not have tears with sadness.
But the peaceful behavior of the entire society with patience and patience is extremely important and we all can learn.
A soldier of Thailand's naval had to lose his lives in the entire mission of this relief operation.
The entire world saw that the brave courage and courage of the soldiers who were stuck in the cave in a very difficult situation full of water and darkness.
This incident showed that when humanity is united, such wonderful things happen.
But for that only we need to focus on the calm and stable minds for which we are working.
A few days ago, our country's beloved poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was one of the specialities.
Besides hope, faith and determination, he had a lot of faith in himself.
Every thing of Neeraj ji can prove to be very inspiring and powerful to all the Indians.
As such, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers brothers and all the youngsters.
Because in this period there is a problem of entry of colleges .
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school life and enter colleges.
Youngsters are stepping on a new path of life, while our focus comes away from the question and comes to the cut-off.
The attention of the students takes place from home to the hostel now .
Students come out of the umbrella of their parents and come under the umbrella of professors.
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, you should leave your house and leave your village and go to the other side, we will have to become our sarthi by getting out of a safe environment.
Many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a different direction to their lives.
I would like to tell you all that you should remain calm and enjoy this life.
It is important to study but while learning, the natural curiosity of discovering new things should be maintained in you.
Old friends are a special value.
I was telling you that in a very poor family of Madhya Pradesh, a student named Asharam Chaudhary has achieved academic success while dealing with many difficulties in life.
The MBBS entrance examination for ASHARAM Jodhpur has been completed in the first attempt.
Anushka Panda, a Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, is also suffering from a hereditary disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
All of them have done such a thing that the whole world will be watching the problems faced by their determination and irregularity.
If you look at all, you will see many such examples.
Any good event that has happened in any part of the country, in every corner of the country, gives energy to my mind.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes fell on a news and wrote in it: Two youngsters fulfilled the dreams of Modi.
After reading the news, it was reported that how our youngsters use smart and creative technologies and how they try to transform the lives of common man.
The incident was that San Jose City in the United States was considered the centre of technology and once I was interacting with the Indian youth.
At that time, I urge them to consider how you can use the intelligence and skills you have for India and take some time and make something new.
I used to urge them to answer the problem of brain drain.
Professionals from two IT sectors of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my request and brought a new approach.
Using our professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have prepared a Smartgaon App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the whole world, but through this app, any information and information can be obtained on your mobile.
Residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, Gram Pradhan-Sarpanch, District Magistrates and Chief District Officers have created awareness among the people to use this app.
In fact, you say that this is a unique journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year, on 23rd July, the festival of Vari is celebrated with great devotion on Pandharpur.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of great saints such as Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, they roamed the name of Vithal and moved on foot towards Pandharpur.
Vithal, which is also called Vithoba or Pandurang, travellers reach Pandharpur for their visit.
Vithal is a god who protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion towards Panduranga.
Go to the Vithoba temple of Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
The message of goodwill, love and brotherhood has been given through the literature of these saints.
They gave the mantra of strengthening the society against darkness.
And he also wanted to eradicate the old evils from the society, and reflected the edition of compassion, equality and righteousness on the minds of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak is a sea of adventure and self-confidence.
In 20 years, the British tried to prove their treason thrice in a year.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the countrymen a funny incident about Lokmanya Tilak and his effigy of Ahmedabad.
During that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad for their reception, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
The personality of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by the ideas.
On 1st August, 1920, Lokmanya Tilak died, after which Patel decided to make Tilak a memorial in Ahmedabad.
At last, the statue of Tilak was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial on 28th February, 1929, not from anybody else but by Mahatma Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, this statue is also very rare, and Lokmanya Tilak is sitting on a chair, along with Tilak has written the 'Swaraj Hamara Janma Siddha Hai' on the bottom side.
Besides traditional devotion and devotion, the public Ganesh festival became an effective medium to create a sense of harmony and equality among the people of the society.
In that specific period there was a need to fight against the British unitedly.
And due to the festivals started by Tilak, we worked to break the walls of the castes and sects and unite everyone.
The popularity of organising all these festivals has increased in the times of time, it is also reflected that today's young generation has a lot of attraction for the heroes of our ancient traditions and history.
Today, in many cities and almost every streets, the pavilions of Ganesh festivals are seen to be built.
All the families of the streets together organise Ganapati festival .
Here too, our youngsters get a good opportunity, their leadership, festival coordinators, programme organizers and coordinators.
From the idol of Ganesh ji to the decorative items, there should be some environment friendly.
Today, every Indian needs good results of good governance and development.
I speak about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad gave up his life, but he never bowed to foreign rule.
I am fortunate that the village of Chandrashekhar Azad is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I have got the opportunity to visit this village.
I got the opportunity to pay homage to the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad, as if the brave people had pledged to die by the bullets of foreigners, Chandrashekhar Azad had not had the desire to die.
This is one of their specialities.
Once again I salute these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, India's brave daughter and a daughter of a landlord, Hima Das, has made a new history by winning a gold medal in the 400-meter race for the junior under-20 World Athletics winner in Finland.
Another girl Ekta Bhayan of the country has sent me e-mails from Indonesia as an answer to my letter and is now preparing for unity from there to Asian Games.
It has been written in our e-mail that the most important moment in the life of an athlete is the moment when the sportsperson holds the tricolor in his hand.
You are proud of unity, unity.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 won the Unity Gold and Bronze medals.
We should move forward, play and develop.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place in this month but during the rainy season sometimes illness enters the house.
Once again, I must meet Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to interact with you through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Just a few days ago, cricket had a historical face in Bengaluru.
I would like to talk about the cricket bond between India and Afghanistan.
The two teams showcased very good sports.
Rashid Khan, a golden man from Afghanistan, had done a great job in IPL this year.
I thank your Indian friends for providing a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Whatever is excellent and best in Afghanistan, it represents the same.
We have experienced the experience of the sportsperson's attitude, how the sportsperson is.
Sports is a very good medium to unite society and showcase the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope you will continue to play and develop with each other in a similar manner.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June this is the fourth Yoga Day.
Be it the European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters in New York or the Japanese Navy's warships, people were watching yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic Yoga programme was organised and I got the information that women had done guidance to do several asanas.
In Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly practiced Yoga on the snowy mountain range at higher heights.
It is working to break the bonds of the borders and connect everyone.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day by following different kinds of distinctions like caste, religion, region, color or gender.
If people from all over the world used to participate in the programmes of Yoga Day, then why would not their films be enthusiastic in India
Our country's security forces, foothills, naval and air force have been conducted in all three places.
Some of the brave soldiers performed yoga on the submarine.
Some soldiers practiced yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
The warriors of our Air Force were astonished by making yogasanas in the sky at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
The special thing to say is that he did not do yoga in the plane but he did yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has been done everywhere.
Yoga has done the task of crossing the caste, creed and geographical boundaries and to unite people all over the world and we have been living in the minds of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam since ancient times.
Our sages, saints and saints have always stressed on this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it properly and has been shown by meditation.
Today, I believe that the idea of Wellness is working as a revolution.
We see mother in the form of a god, mother gives birth to us, so we consider her as a god, this is our culture.
Sometimes the doctor gives us regeneration .
The role of doctors is not limited to medicinal treatment only .
The Not only Only Cure But Olso Heale, doctors have a good experience about how they should have their lifestyle, how the impact of the style increases and how it has a good impact on our health.
Indian doctors have shown their unlimited capabilities and capabilities and have created their own independent identity all over the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors and colleagues on the sidelines of the countrymen on the 1st July of Doctors Day.
India has a rich history.
The Kabirwad of Gujarat will be a good idea, when I used to work in Gujarat, there was a big national session of the people of Saint Kabir's tradition.
Everyone knows that in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Saint Kabir Das, a village named Maghar, had taken the grave.
But we are sure that Kabir Das ji had chosen this place for the samadhi.
At that time it was believed that the person who died here is not able to get a place in heaven.
On the contrary, whoever sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Maghar was considered to be an absurd place but Saint Kabir Das did not believe in such things.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through Sakhia and both.
This was their ideal.
This is the ideal that we see from their compositions.
The meaning of this is that the one who understands the pain of another is true fakir , saint .
And those who do not know the sorrows of others are ruthless.
Kabir Das ji had given special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and respect them.
Though this time has been lost, Kabir's words are equally effective.
Today, when Kabir ji read and listened, it seems that today's knowledge is telling us about the age of age.
We feel that their ideas are relevant to today.
When we are talking about Saint Kabir Das Ji, I remember one of his two words in which he says: "Guru Govind Dou Khare, Kake can apply
Such a great guru is Jagatguru - Guru Nanakdev.
He showed the way to crores of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanakdev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
In such a kitchen, the people of any caste, religion and sect can come and eat food and Guru Nanak Dev started the process of 'Langar'.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
The terrible incident that took place in Jallianwala Bagh will complete 100 years in 2019, which will finish the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always conquered.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji is his birth anniversary and in this programme today, I would like to visit Dr.
During the period 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was contributing immensely.
West Bengal was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Let us all come to Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
It will be said that he has got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of the people through the files.
Through the Common Service Centre (CSC) in remote and remote villages, the youngsters are providing services from wages to passports of elderly people in villages.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister gathers a ice cream and makes it a ice cream.
In Jharkhand, like Anjan Prakash, lakhs of young people of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates by going to nearby villages.
I am extremely happy for the success of the common man than the success of the government in this entire programme. This is the real strength of the common man.
In such a disappointing environment, the government will not be credited with the hopes, new zeal and events that are happening in our lives.
The incident of a young girl from a small village in the remote areas also inspires the 125 crore Indians.
With the help of technology, interacting with the beneficiaries through video bridge, a moment spent with them has also become extremely pleasant and inspiring.
A new joy, new zeal, new motivation, in a way to put life for the poorest of the poor.
I am extremely grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in the video bridge and they worked to give me a new strength.
I would like to once again express my gratitude to all of you for this.
On the one hand there are professionals and technologists and on the other hand our farmers working in the field are brothers and sisters.
Now you will also be thinking that agriculture and technology are both different businesses.
The schemes were started and their successful efforts were made to increase the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, from the production of crops to its marketing, the role of the farmer brother is important, and on the other hand, efforts are made to ensure the participation of the farmers in the benefits.
Friends
This work that we have done in youth will inspire the youngsters.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
I would like to give the highest credit to the States for the reform of One Nation, One Tax.
GST Cooperative Federalism is a very good example of which all the States have decided for the country's interest and after that it was possible to make such a wider tax reform in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people from different political ideologies come together in this meeting.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of tax systems in the country, but now in the new system, the same tax system has been implemented in the entire country.
GST is a victory of honesty and it is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, many times there were complaints about inspector Raj in tax cases.
GST will probably be the biggest tax reform in the world.
Generally, a period of 5 to 7 years would be required to improve such a massive population and to stabilize the entire scheme.
Namaskar recently organized the 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
And when there is such an atmosphere, then who can stay away from it, when there is a resolution to show enthusiasm, enthusiasm, hope, aspirations, something.
This was the time when people from all over the country used to think that who will play today.
How many medals we can win and all of them were very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won a medal after one.
Whether it is Namebazi or cottage or weightlifting or table tennis or badminton India has done the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze India has won a total of 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
It is a matter of pride and happiness for every sportsperson to win medals.
This is an extremely proud moment for all the countrymen and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to express that feeling.
But I want to hear what I have heard from these sportspersons.
This is the reason why there were many such things that have happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won the medal in all the events that took part.
She is the first Indian female sportsperson who won Indias first gold medal in the individual table tennis.
India won the most medals.
The 15-year-old Indian Nambaz Anish Bhawar became the youngest player who won the Gold in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary, who wins the medal in the Commonwealth Games, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
This year's sports event was also special because most of the medal winners were women sportspersons.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, naming, women sportspersons performed excellent performance.
All of them were eager about this fight, both medals and medals would be given to India.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition came from small towns in different parts of the country.
His friends have also contributed, who have enhanced their patience in every situation.
In the last month's Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the countrymen, especially our youth to fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters and have shown their support, have sent letters, have shared their mantra of health on social media - Fit India Gath.
A household Shashikant Bhosle has written sharing his picture in the water pond - my weapon is my body, my delement is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And he further says - for me - fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Devnathji is healthy in happiness.
Dhawal Prajapati, while sharing his picture of trekking, wrote: Travel and trekking for me is a fit India.
I am very happy to see that many famous people are encouraging our youngsters in a very attractive manner for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many of the youngsters have shared their experiences while participating in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are extremely beneficial for all of you and for the entire country.
I will certainly say one more thing - Yoga is the name of Fit India Movement without spending any money.
The significance of International Yoga Day on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
You will also be ready from now on.
Not alone: Your city, your villages, your department, your schools, your colleges, every person of any age should try to participate in yoga.
Today I would like to interact with you to invite you for a new job and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to participate in a special internship.
Whether it is three Ministries of Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government of India have come together and launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 initiative.
The students and students of the college, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendra, whoever wants to do something, whoever wants to participate in the society, whoever wants to change
And it will also strengthen the cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to do something and I will also say that those who are the best trainees, those who have done good work in the colleges, those who have done good work in the universities will be given national awards.
Not only this, the UGC will also give two credit points to the trainees who will complete this.
I invite students, students and youth to take advantage of this internship once again.
You can register MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youngsters will definitely succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these vacations as an opportunity to take a new experience.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign for the education of children living in the streets and huts.
Initially, the condition of the children who had been begging on the streets or working small and big works left them so much that they bowed themselves completely in this work.
This mission, which started from 15 children in the nearby huttle of Gita Colony, Delhi, has now reached 2,000 children from 12 places in the capital.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this mission have participated in this Bhagirath effort to bring about social change by taking two hours from their busy day.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a source of inspiration for the farmers of the country.
With collective efforts, they have changed their fate not only to themselves but also to our region.
Mainly Mandwa , Chaulai maize or barley crops are taken in Bageshwar of Uttarakhand .
What did they say - they started making biscuits from this crop in the field and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have opened a factory to prepare biscuits there.
Keeping in mind the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani .
With the hard work of the farmers, the annual hike of the institution has not only reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs but it has also reduced the migration from the districts due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that in the future there will be war for water in the world.
Everyone speaks this, but is it not our responsibility
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every individual should be responsible.
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu may have seen that in some temples of Tamil Nadu there are large inscriptions written in temples regarding irrigation systems, water conservation systems, drought management etc.
Whether it is Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will find big inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, various wells are popular as tourist destinations, but we do not forget that these are also living evidence of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors.
In Gujarat, the queen of Adlaj and the queen of Patna is the world heritage and its grandeur is worth seeing.
The ponds are in a way only the water temples .
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to see the moon well in Jodhpur .
This is the biggest and well-known well in India and the most important thing is that it is in the area where water is deficient.
The period of April, May, June and July is the best time to collect rain water and if we prepare it beforehand then we will get the more benefit.
MNREGA funds are also used for water conservation.
In the last three years, everybody has made his own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
In addition to MNREGA funds every year, an average cost of Rs. 32 thousand crore has been spent on water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 64 thousand crore, 55 of the total expenditure has been spent for water storage of around Rs. 35 thousand crore.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land has been benefitted due to water storage and water management measures.
Under MNREGA, the district administration has taken responsibility for large amounts of land and water conservation.
With the help of people from about 40 to 45 villages, Sasur Khadri has revived the dry rivers.
Whether it is animals or birds or farmers or farming or village, this is a big success.
I would like to say that once again April, May, June, July are before us, we should also take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also make some plans, we should also do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I have messages, letters and phones all around.
Ian Kumar Banerjee, from Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many do not know the theory of living with peace, beauty and honesty of the Nobel winner Rabindranath Tagore.
Please discuss this subject in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I express my gratitude to ING that he attracted the attention of all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and wisdom, whose writings enshrined on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he used to have a teacher every time.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music by getting up early in the morning. And when Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmani used to get an opportunity to listen to this poem then I got a new consciousness.
Rabindra Music and his poems must have pronounced you too.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
In a few days, the holy month of Ramzan will start.
The entire world celebrates the month of Ramzan with full fervour and respect.
The collective purpose of the daily routine is that when a person is hungry on his own, he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty, he feels thirsty of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and message of Prophet Mohammad.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once a person asked the Prophets: What is the best thing in Islam
Prophet Saheb said, Give food to the poor and the needy and compassionately think about everyone, whether you know them or not.
Mohammad, who was sent, believed in his knowledge and compassion.
They had no ego of anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Mohammad was confident that no person is rich due to his holy soul, not because of his wealth.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha showing the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima remembers Lord Buddha and reminds him of the responsibility of following the path shown by him.
Lord Buddha is the inspirational power of equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values which are the most important in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Babasaheb empowered crores of people, be it dalits, sufferers, exploited and deprived through the incident.
This cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
In order to understand the grief of the people, compassion was one of the great qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that Buddhist monks traveled to different countries with them with the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and this happens forever.
The entire Asia has the legacy of teachings of Lord Buddha.
Several Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings and for this reason, we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist places in Southeast Asia to important Buddhist places in India.
I am happy that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, which includes the beautiful Anand Mandir of Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, there is a sense of struggle and human sorrow everywhere in the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to end the evil with compassion.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion all over the world on Buddha Purnima.
Lord Buddha seeks blessings for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility for creating a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard of the idols of Lafing Buddha, it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings good fortune, but some people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event in Indias defence history.
Now you would be wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
It was the day of Buddha Purnima.
Nuclear test was conducted on 11th May, 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
20 years are being completed and with the blessings of Lord Buddha, Buddha Purnima was tested.
Indias test has succeeded and thus India has shown its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has marked its military strength in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we become stronger as a country, we move on a peaceful path with each other.
As the Nuclear Tests were conducted in the month of May 1998, this month is not only important for the country, but it is important for the manner in which these tests were conducted.
The incident showed to the whole world that India's land is the land of great scientists and India can attain new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
When we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of 11th May, 1998, we should pledge to contribute to the creation of a modern India, a strong India, a strong India, a strong India, a strong India, achieving the mantra that Atal ji had given to us for the power of India.
Participate your strength in the power of India.
We can also get a new joy and new satisfaction to carry forward the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, let us meet in the next Mann Ki Baat programme.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
A few days ago, on 26th January, when all the heads of the ASEAN countries came here, the artists of that country along with them came here.
And it is a matter of pride that most of the countries of them presented the Ramayana to us.
That is, the Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries as effective and inspiring today.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ram Navami.
Just like my dear countrymen, I have received a large number of letters, emails, phone calls and responses from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written on the launch of an online class of Sanskrit on MyGov.
I read a response written by Shri Yut Dhanshyam Kumar ji of Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi app.
The concern that you have expressed on the declining water reservoir of the land is of course very important.
Shreeyut Shakal Shastri ji of Karnataka used a lot of shoe in words and wrote that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman Bhoomi is there.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji says that I should talk about the health of the youth this time.
According to him, if we compare with other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that this time I will discuss with everyone about health in detail - will discuss a strong India.
The Pacific Government of India shared all the photos and videos on the same day on social media and Narendra Modi app.
Now you like that photo and tweet and reach your friends.
Anga, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written to me the gratitude cards they have given behind the book 'Exam Warrior'.
I would like to tell you all, Anga, Jaish and all the other children, that due to these letters my fatigue is overwhelming.
All these letters, such phone calls, responses, and all that I could read, and all that I could get to hear, I met my heart.
Today, even though I have decided to share the same thing, I will have to tell it continuously for months and months.
More and more letters have been sent by children at this time, they have written about the examination.
I have told my plans on the holiday.
Animals and birds do not get water in the summer have been worried about it.
Farmers brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers' fairs and the things that happen in the country.
Some aware citizens have suggested measures regarding water conservation.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio with each other, I have experienced a way in which maximum number of letters come on the subjects related to summer.
Prior to the examination, there are letters for the care of the students.
That is, things in the mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things in our minds change the weather in someone else's life and why not change
When I get to read in your letters, how the rickshaw driver of Karimganj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for poor children with the strength of his will, I see the rare will power of our country.
When I got to hear the words of Dr. Amit Mohan Chaudhary of Kanpur, he goes on the pavement to give food to the poor and also provides free medicines, then I get the opportunity to experience the brotherhood of the country.
Several travellers traveling through their cabs helped a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
After 12 years of money, he succeeded in the Bhagirath efforts of Akher Sadul Laskar.
Today, due to his determination and his hard work, he has built a sickness house with around 30 beds in Punari village near Kolkata.
Today, the vision of seeing the whole world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, the mention of these sons and daughters of Mother India is hidden in it.
A positive atmosphere of hope and self-confidence has been created.
This self-confidence, this will realize our pledge of positive and New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Whether it is from Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all the farming and farmers consider it to be an integral part of the economy of the country and the common life.
Besides, Lal Bahadur Shastri also stressed on the protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural structures.
In his speech in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh had urged the farmers to use new technologies and innovate them and stressed the need for them.
This state, which has a very small area, has done a big job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved record production in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have proved by their experience that when the goals are fixed, there are strong resolutions, there is a desire to realize that they can be fulfilled.
Brothers and sisters, An important decision has been taken in this year's budget to provide a fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the notified crops will be given a minimum of one and a half times the cost of their production.
If the cost of production is to be explained in detail then the workers who work on the farms, their labour, their hard work and expenditure, the equipments or animals, the price of seeds, the price of all kinds of fertilizers, the price of all kinds of fertilizers, the fertilizers given to the state government, the interests given to the capital, the farm fare is not only on the fare but also the fare of the farmer who works on his own or his family, the value of his labour will also be added to the production cost.
Besides, the work of improving the agricultural market in the country is also going on at a comprehensive level to provide fair market prices to the farmers.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets, village markets and then global markets.
In order to ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods, they are being upgraded by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country and will be connected to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi begins.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our pledge, how can we come together to pay homage to Gandhiji
How should Gandhi be the people of the concept of 150
Let us all come together to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and we have to take our country to a new height by remembering Bapu and inspiring him from him.
Today, the country has moved ahead of a traditional approach in the field of health.
It was believed that the health ministry had the responsibility to do all the health related work in the country.
However, now all the Ministries and Departments, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, Ministry of AYUSH, Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Whether it is the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all the departments are working together for a healthy India.
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easy solution.
The more we are aware to take care of the health, the more we will get the benefits of the person, the family and the society.
Besides, work is going on at a comprehensive level to set up a healthcare centre across the country.
In the field of preventive healthcare, Yoga has created a new identity in the world today.
The body remains healthy and strong due to yoga
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached the household due to the commitment of Yoga for all of us.
On this year's International Yoga Day - that is, on 21st June, there are still 100 days left.
In the last three years, people from all over the country and the world participated with great enthusiasm in the event of every International Yoga Day.
This year also, let us decide that we will do Yoga ourselves and motivate our entire family, friends and others to Yoga.
With new, attractive methods, we want to make Yoga more popular to children, youth and senior citizens and women and men of every age group.
However, the country's Television and Electronic Media are conducting various Yoga programmes throughout the year.
But can some programmes to create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga Teacher, but Yoga is certain.
However, some people have made me Yoga teachers using their innovations and have made some 3D animated videos of my yoga.
I can take this video to you all, that is, we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Today, more than 3,000 Janaushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable rates.
The work of setting up more new centres is also going on.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to get the information of these Janaushadhi Kendras to the needy so that their cost of medicines will be very low and they will be served a lot.
The price of stents required for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The cost of knee implant surgery has been reduced by 50 to 70 percent by controlling the cost of equipment.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore households will be provided with the Government of India and insurance companies in a year for the treatment of about 50 crore citizens.
The total number of seats in the existing 479 Medical Colleges in the country has been increased to 68 thousand.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to ensure better treatment and better health facilities for people across the country.
A new Medical College will be set up for every three districts.
Our goal is to make the entire country tuberculosis free by 2025.
This is a very big task.
We need to make every person aware and help them.
To get rid of tuberculosis, all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He was of the opinion that the poorest of the poor will also be employed by the industry.
Today, the Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a situation, the dream that Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt of becoming an industrial power is inspiring us.
Today, India has become a brightest star in the world's economy, the highest FDI in the world is being made in India today.
The world looks at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
In this context, the Smart City Mission and City Campaign have been launched to provide better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had a strong faith in his self-reliance.
He was not sure that someone should lead his life in poverty.
At the same time, he was also of the opinion that the poor will not get rid of their poverty by providing some comfortable facilities.
Today, initiatives such as Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India are creating young researchers and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
It was Babasaheb's vision to set up a separate commission related to the river reservoirs authority and water related commissions in the country's development.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are being developed at different coasts of India and infrastructure in the old ports is being strengthened.
Discussions were the main issues in the 40s, others were the wars, the Cold Wars and Flags.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of the federal system and stressed on the need to work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federal system in every department of governance and the cooperative federal system.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is the inspiration of crores of backward classes like me.
He assured us that we do not need to be born in a rich or prestigious family to move forward in life, but even those who are born in a poor family in India can see big dreams and try to fulfil them and succeed in it.
Many people often attacked Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is India which belongs to Ambedkar, to the poor and to the backward classes.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar, the Gram-Swarajya Abhiyan will be held from 14th April to 5th May.
It will have various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this event, the Prime Minister said.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi are coming.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir, who gave the message of non-violence, are inspiring for all of us.
Greetings to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
He recalled the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus and gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to humanity.
In April the festival of Baisakhi is celebrated in Punjab and West India .
Many thanks
We have seen that the color of the sea is blue but in everyday life we feel that water is colorless, it does not have color.
Whether it is a river or a sea or a colour of water, we have never thought of it
This was the question of a young man in the 1920s.
This is the question that a great scientist of modern India has emerged.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on light skating.
His discovery is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
It is believed that on 28th February, Raman had discovered light skating and we celebrate 28th February every year as the National Science Day, he received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
This country has given several great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand there were traditions of great mathematicians Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand Sushrut and Charak have their pride in healthcare.
Scientists from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose the famous Boson particle has also been named .
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme of Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the science sector.
Artificial Intelligence helps in creating robots and excellent working machines.
Nowadays, the machines are making their own intelligence smarter through self-determination.
This technology can be used to ease the lives of the poor, the deprived and the needy.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I would urge the scientific community to use Artificial Intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier
Can we imagine natural disasters through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I got the opportunity to visit the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man had developed a digital tool that cannot speak, a silent person wrote his words that he was transformed into a voice and we can interact with this person as we talk to a person.
I think we can use Artificial Intelligence in many such places.
The machine works like our wishes.
But what we want to do with the machine depends on us.
The objective of humanitarian purposes here is important, use of science for human welfare, use of science to achieve the highest height of human life.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the lightning lamp, has often failed in many of his experiments.
Asked him about this, he said that I have discovered ten thousand methods of making electricity lights, that is, Edison made his ineffective power.
Today, I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharshi Arvind.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule and fought against them and asked for a responsibilities towards their rule.
As a great sage, he raised questions about every aspect of life.
He found the answer and guided humanity.
In order to know the truth, the spirit of repeated questioning is important.
Behind scientific discovery this is also a true inspiration.
We should not be able to stay healthy until we get the answers to these questions.
On National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to all those associated with our scientific and science sector.
May our young generation inspire us to discover truth and knowledge, inspire us to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of seizure, security and disasters, and people write something or the other.
Pune Rabindra Singh has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on Vocational Safety in his reaction.
He writes that the quality of safety in factories and construction in our country is not as good.
On the occasion of Indias National Security Day on 4th March, the Prime Minister said that in his Mann Ki Baat, we should take the topic of Safety, which will enhance peoples awareness about safety.
When we talk about public security, two things are important, readiness and preparation.
Safety is of two types one which is necessary at the time of disaster and the other is necessary in daily life that is safe .
In everyday life we are not aware of safety but it is difficult to get security at the time of disaster .
If we remain cautious and follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and also save our society from a big accident.
We see that many things have been written about safety at work place but they do not seem to be followed.
The municipalities and municipalities who have firefighters should go to different schools in a week or a month to make a mock drill before the students.
It will have two benefits, the firefighters will also have the habit of being cautious and the new generation will also get education in this regard and there is no need to spend separately, in a way it becomes a part of education.
India is geographically diverse, if we talk about disasters and disasters.
This country has faced some natural, man-made, disasters and chemical and industrial accidents.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management of the country.
NDMA runs faster in disasters such as earthquake, floods, storms and landslides.
Training and awareness play an important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people had to lose their lives every year due to heat, then NDMA took up campaigns and workshops to create awareness in this regard.
This shows that if we give priority to security then we can get security.
The brave soldiers of the Fire Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Armed Forces and Armed Forces do not serve their lives in crisis and help the people.
NCCs and Scouts also help in this work and provide training.
This was the first and comprehensive endeavour of joint disaster management of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal.
These values should become an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on creating wealth from waste and waste energy for the village under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The initiative has been initiated and called Gobar Dhan, Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resource.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from harvest and biological residue but it was not used in India with full potential.
We are moving forward in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
The aim is to use livestock weavers, waste in the fields, cooking waste in the household for biogass-based energy generation.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to look at harvest and waste as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help the villages to live clean.
It will help farmers and animal rearers to increase their income.
Employment opportunities will increase due to waste collection, transportation and sale of biogas.
An online platform will be created for proper implementation of the Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to the consumer and will get a fair price for harvest and agricultural cultivation.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters and sisters living in rural India to take the initiative and take advantage of this opportunity by creating a Self Help Group and creating a Cooperative Committee.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement for clean energy and green employment, and take steps to transform the waste into wealth and wealth of our villages.
Different art works have been prepared by using waste.
Workshops were organized to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone shared innovative ideas about cleanliness, discussed and presented poems.
There was a festive atmosphere for cleanliness.
Particularly schoolchildren participated in the event.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which this festival was organized for waste management and sanitation.
Every year, 8th March is celebrated as International Women's Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and around the world.
Women working in different fields are honoured on this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead of women development and is moving towards development under the leadership of women.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's ideas, he said, Adarsh women's concept is a complete freedom.
125 years ago, the idea of Swamiji expresses concern over the power of women in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal partnership for women in every field of social and economic life and it is our responsibility for all of us.
We are a part of the tradition where men are identified by women, the son of Yashoda, the son of Kaushalya, the son of Gandhari.
Women are empowered, empowered, are equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested a good thing to me, he said that on March 8, several programmes will be held on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistri.
You can imagine how a big event is.
Women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has such a power that will transform Swachhta Abhiyan into a culture of cleanliness in normal life as a habit of people.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, I had the news that after 70 years of independence in three villages of Eliphanta Islands, there was a lot of joy in the people.
You know that this island is 10 kilometres away from Mumbai.
For 70 years in Elephanta, the life of Rajbandar, Morabandar and Set Port had spread darkness in the lives of the people.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
I am happy that Eliphanta village and caves have now emerged shining.
This is not just a power but a new beginning.
What can be a matter of joy that the lives of the countrymen should be shining and enjoyed in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Mahashivaratri.
This month's speciality is the splendid splendor of yielding yields of yielding crops in the month of March.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
Holi will be celebrated across the country on 2nd March.
Holi has the importance of colour and holika is also important to burn evil trends.
May this festival be pleasant in the lives of our countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
This is the first time I interact with you through Mann Ki Baat in 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
This was the first time in history that the event was attended by Honble Guests from 10 countries.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing rapidly in every field in India, are progressing ahead and the country's values are elevating.
The honour given to women of our country from ancient times, their place in the society and their contribution is a big thing in the entire world.
There is a great tradition of great scholars in India.
Several scholars from India have contributed significantly to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi do not know how many names can be taken.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society and our family in the threshold of unity.
Whether it is a great scholar like Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreyi of the Vedic period or a great scholar like Akka Mahadevi and Meerabai, or a ruler like Ahilyabai Holkar or a brave Ranragini like Rani Lakshmibai, women power always inspires us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that his brave defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, seemed to be inspiring to travel through the sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft.
The three brave women fighters of Bhavkanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become aeronautical and are now training in 'Sukhoi-30'.
A few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
The President met a group of women who have done such extraordinary performances for the first time in their respective fields.
Our women power has done extraordinary work to break the chain of conservation of society and established a new record.
He showed that hard work, tireless efforts, and if the resolution is strong then there is a crisis, there is a hurdle, it can be crossed by crossing them and surpassing a new path.
Now this path not only inspires the people of our times but also generations to come.
This book is available in the form of "E-book" on the occasion of Narendra Modi website.
Today, the women power of this country has played a very important role in the positive transformation between the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station here.
You must have thought of what is the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga railway station in Mumbai.
There are women employees in all the departments in this station .
After seeing the guidance of Republic Day, many people wrote on the writers and other social media that the point of view in the operation is that all women participated in the BSF Bike Continent.
These women used adventurous experiments and were surprised by these visions to the guests who came from abroad.
Both words empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today our women are leading.
And they are becoming self-reliant.
However, our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture before the country.
The campus of Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
Atrocities, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols have created a very terrible atmosphere here.
Tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-rickshaws in such a dangerous area.
Whether it is the introduction of a society that has transformed itself and the system of reforming itself or not.
Continuous efforts are being made in our country at the individual and social levels against social evils and evil practices.
Recently, a good effort has been made in Bihar a few days ago.
In order to eliminate social evils, more than 13 thousand kilometres long human chain has been created in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people created awareness in the society against bad practices like child marriage, hooliganism etc.
The entire state has pledged to fight against evils like Hunda and Child Marriage.
Young people, mothers and sisters participated in this mission.
This human chain, which started from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, was linked to the border of the state.
Our society should be freed from such evils, so that all the people of the society need to get the right benefit of development.
Let us all come together to pledge to eliminate these evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and prosperous India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain.
However, after getting information about Jan Aushadhi Kendras, they have started buying medicines from there and now the cost of their parents' medicines has decreased by 75 percent.
This provides huge financial assistance to the common man, especially the senior citizens who are using medicines everyday.
Generic medicines purchased are similar to the standards set by the World Health Organisation.
This is the reason why good quality medicines can be available at affordable prices.
Today, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides cheaper medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and hospitals at Amrit Stores.
The only objective of all these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor of the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be created.
My dear countrymen, Shri Yut Mangesh has sent a photograph on the Narendra Modi Mobile App from Maharashtra.
With the separation of this picture, my attention will be drawn to him.
One of the youngsters participated in the Clean Morana River Clean Morana Campaign along with their lives.
I am told that the people of Akola have started a programme to clean the Morana river in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more painful thing is that in the utensils of the river there was wild grass and water fountains.
There was a large amount of waste and waste on the river and its banks.
The villagers have formulated an action plan and the Swachh Morana Mission was prepared on January 13, one day before Makar Sankranti, in the first phase, both the shores of the Morana river were cleaned at four kilometres in four kilometres area.
I am told that till the time the Morana river is not cleaned completely, Akolekar will continue this campaign every Saturday morning.
One can see that if a person decides to do something, then it is impossible to do something.
The mass movement can bring about a transformation by doing a big job.
My dear countrymen, today there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year, but for the last three years, the entire process of this award has been changed.
Now any citizen can suggest any name for this award.
This entire process has become transparent because of the online process.
Now the work done by the person is being taken into consideration and introducing it to the award.
You must have heard that you will be very happy to know the work of Arvind Gupta ji.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life in making sports for young children.
They are constantly trying to make the students use classically and to know the science of that thing.
For this, he went to three thousand schools across the country and showed pictures made in 18 different languages and inspired the children.
This is the same thing as Sitava Jodti of Karnataka.
He is not being addressed as a goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, Sitava has contributed to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
In the seventh year of age, he was dedicated to himself as Devdasi, but Sitava spent his entire life for the welfare of Devdasi.
Not only this, he has also done great work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard about Bhajju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor and tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for supplementing but he was fond of doing traditional tribal paintings.
This is the reason why he has received respect not only in India but also in the entire world.
In many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England and Italy, their pictures have been exhibited.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri award by recognising the talent of Bhajju Shyamji, who has named India abroad.
They have made more than five hundred medicinal plants based on their memories.
He has been awarded the Padmashree Award for his social work by discovering such fame persons.
Today, I would like to mention one more name here and the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Award.
Subhasini Mistri rubbed utensils and sold vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
This crisis in life inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in hospitals built by their tireless hard work.
I would like to tell the countrymen that those who work around us, who live for the society, who dedicate their lives, who have worked for the society, who have worked for the entire life with some or the other goals.
Such people do not work for respect and respect at all.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Mahatma Gandhi returned to India on 9th January from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating the festivals of Indians living in India and around the world.
You will be happy to know that the mayor of Indian origin, Parliamentarians and people from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America and many other countries have participated in this event.
I would like to thank the European Union for doing a remarkable job, creating the identity of the people of the original Indian origin and giving this information to the people of the world through guidance.
On 30th January, the death anniversary of those revered Bapuji who showed a new path to all of you.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, whether India or the world, individual or family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last event of Mann Ki Baat in this year and see Yoga, today is the last day of the year 2017.
In this whole year, we talked about a lot of things and shared a lot.
Innumerable letters, responses, exchange of ideas for Mann Ki Baat, all these things would always give me new energy.
Now this year is going to change in a few hours, but our talk and dialogue will continue.
In the coming years too, we will interact on new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, Christmas festival was celebrated all over the world on 25th December.
We also see the feelings of service in Bible.
The San of Man Haz Cum, Not to B Sarvahad, But to Servah, And to Give Hiz Life, Az Blassingtu All Humankind.
In these texts, what is the name of service, what is the greatness.
Whether there is any caste, religion, tradition, character, but the invaluable form of humanity is introduced through service.
In our country, Nishkam Karma is being spoken about, and Nishkam Karma is not expected, service is not done.
We are also called 'Seva Parmo Dharma'.
Jeevan-Seva is Shiva-Seva and Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans have said that life-serving should be done in a spiritual manner.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
An extraordinary life full of bravery and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values of life and lived on the basis of the same values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji worked to inspire people through all the roles of a Guru, a poet, a philosophical and philosophicalist, a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustice.
He taught people to bind the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, he had to absorb a lot at personal level.
However, he never gave up the feeling of foolishness in his mind.
Every moment in his life, he gave a message of love, sacrifice and peace.
How great and unique his personality can be seen from this.
I am fortunate that I got the opportunity to participate in the light festival organized by Patna Saheb on the occasion of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
January 1, 2018.
You will also be surprised to know that the new year was coming and one January also comes every year.
But when I say that it is a special thing, it is really a special thing.
And I urge all of you to register your names as voters.
The entire India is eager to welcome it as a voter of the 21st century.
While becoming voters of the 21st century, you will also feel respected.
Our opinion is the basis of a New India.
This is the biggest power of vote in democracy.
Votes are the most effective instrument for bringing about positive changes in the lives of millions of people.
We only have the right to vote.
So how should we be India in the 21st century, what should we have our dreams in the 21st century India
You will also be able to become a manufacturer of the 21st century and it will be specifically started from January 1.
I am confident that the vision of our New India will be realized on the strength of the skills of this youngster.
When we talk about New India, it should be free from the toxics of ethnicism, sectarianism, terrorism and corruption.
He should be free from hygiene and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India must be our guided power.
Let the youngsters of New India come forward and discuss how New India should be.
They should also set a way for us and those who have been associated with it will become such a big group.
We will continue to move forward and the country will also move forward.
Just as I was interacting with you, I thought that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Can the youngsters of the age group of 18-25 years come together in this initiative and enhance their ideas on the subject of 'New India'
How can we achieve our resolution before 2022
What can we do to build India in the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi became a mass movement in the form of freedom movement.
My young friends, today it is necessary that we should also raise a mass movement for a magnificent divine India in the 21st century.
Today, many new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and are successful.
I think that the youngsters of New India should be able to get information about all these schemes and create an independent strong system.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I was telling you about the importance of positive.
Any work can be easily achieved and possible for those who have positive and enthusiasm.
People in English say that in the last Mann Ki Baat, Passimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power, I would urge the countrymen to share the positive moments we have experienced in the year 2017 and welcome in the same positive environment.
People gave a very positive response to the gates of social media, My Gov and Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Some people have done some special work in their personal life, they have also been shared.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live here in Peacock Vihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
A.
I would be able to get this loan very easily and my daughters could continue their education.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I speak from the Bodle here.
My name is Santosh Madhav.
Our Bhinnar village has worked on national highways in 2017.
That is why the roads have become very good and the business is faster here.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
I reside in Mohalla Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a very serious problem of water in our part, and for the last 40 years we were dependent on the aeroplane of the Army.
Now there has been an independent drive for us.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy of these small things. Let us take concrete steps to move from a positive India to a progressive India.
Now we are discussing positiveness, so I am also enthusiastic about one thing here.
Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who has recently won the highest position in the Administrative Services Examination in Kashmir, is very encouraging.
He got the first place in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination, leaving out of the atmosphere of terrorism and Kamali.
He wrote the story of success.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
It has proved that however bad the situation is, it has proved that depression can be ruined through positive action.
Recently, last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
I used to know about the desires and zeals they had.
It was a matter of immense hope that all those people who lived in their minds were trying to make progress in their lives.
I feel disappointed with them while talking to them.
They were enthusiastic, joyful, joyful, enormous energy, immense dreams and resolutions.
I was also inspired by the time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters.
This is my youngster and this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala not only in our country but also in the famous religious places of the world.
In this world famous temple, crores of devotees come every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami.
P.
No one is big in this campaign, no one is small.
Every traveller considers it to be a part of the worship of God and works for cleanliness.
Now everybody has such a big celebrity, no matter how rich it is, no matter how rich it is, no one works in big positions, everybody participates in this 'Punyam Punkvanam' programme like ordinary traveller.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong pledge of cleanliness along with hard drainage.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu, all of you have made a pledge to make Swachh Bharat, Swachh Bharat free from Swachhta.
Efforts are being made in the direction of cleanliness across the country.
There is now a change in the rural and urban areas due to mass participation.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be held from 4th January to 10th March 2018 to look into the success of the Swachhta Mission in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4,000 cities and about 40 crore people in the country.
Is it going to be examined whether there is a scientific arrangement for cleaning the waste in the cities, whether it is being arranged for waste management or not, whether it is an attempt to change the habits of the people, how much people's participation in this work, capability building and innovations are being used for cleanliness.
During this survey, different groups will be going to check the cities.
They will interact with the citizens and understand their reactions.
How the Swachhta App is being used and they will be analyzed to improve various services sites.
It is not at all that it is only the government to keep cleanliness.
It is also a big responsibility for every citizen and citizen organisation to maintain cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the Swachhta Survekshan.
And do not ask for cleanliness in your city, make a pledge that your streets and streets do not fall behind your society.
I am sure you must have felt the habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste and you will be using blue and green hats while waste.
Reduce, reuse and re-cycle are very effective for waste.
Clean cities will be ranked on the basis of this survey, if the population of our city is more than one lakh, then there is a population of more than one lakh and less than one lakh, then we should have a dream to achieve the highest number in the regional rankings.
And we should also make such efforts.
And all of us should have a dream that our cities - our efforts, our progress and progress of the country.
Let us once again recall the revered Bapu and make efforts to fulfil the resolution of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small to see but if we look at it as a society then we become an identity.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share the same thing with you.
I understand that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without mere 'Maharam' or her 'male palanquin'.
Specially, such bonds and rules are not even in Islamic countries.
But only Muslim women in India did not get this right.
And I am very happy to note that our governments have taken care of this thing.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to follow the confidence of our women and their talent.
And that is why our women should also get equal rights and equal opportunities along with men and our efforts should be made continuously and we need to move forward with women and men on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic festival for you.
This year, 26th January, 2018 will be specially remembered.
This year, the leaders of all the ten ASEAN countries will be visiting India as chief guests of the Republic Day celebrations.
This year, the Republic Day will be one or ten chief guests.
The year 2017 was special for the ASEAN nation and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of pride for all our Indians to join these great leaders of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, the day of festivals and festivals is going on and if we see that our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps no such day can be said that no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the new year bring you all very joy, happiness and prosperity.
Let us move forward with new zeals, new zeals, new joys and new resolutions.
In January this month, the festival of Makar Sankranti is being celebrated in the beginning of the sunset, which is connected to nature.
If we call Sankranti in Rajasthan, then Magh-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals have a special significance.
All these festivals are usually celebrated from 13th to 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we will repeat the same thing in 2018.
The Indian citizens will not be able to find any respect for them.
At that age, they are very bigger than all of us and are witnesses of various stages and phases of the country.
I was fortunate to have a telephone conversation with Didi before leaving for a foreign tour.
It was a lovely dialogue between us that we should speak to our elder sisters with a younger brother.
I do not speak so much about such personal speeches.
Listen, Latadi is also eager for all things related to the country even at this momentum of life.
The feeling of satisfaction in his life is linked to the progress of India, the transforming India, the new heights of progress are connected to India.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar.
I am speaking to Shri Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I am on a plane journey.
Lata ji: Okay, well.
What to celebrate the next day
And what we have achieved has been achieved through meditation and penance.
I'm not really anything.
Lata ji: Yes.
I also keep getting your letters and I keep getting your visits.
I don't want to give you a lot of trouble because I see that I imagine how much you work and how much you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: But I'll come soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for several weeks to come.
Our houses will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of these festivals.
It is called darkness under Diwa.
Most of these words are not just a word, but we have an order, a philosophy, a motivation.
Whenever there comes sweets, clothes and gifts in our homes, then you should go out for a minute.
Definitely do the work of providing things that are more than required in our homes, which we do not use now.
In many cities, many such institutions work with start-ups of young colleagues.
They collect clothes, cereals and food from the houses of the people, and search for the needy and reach them.
The laughing laughed on the faces of many poor families will double the joy of festivals, will shine on our faces, our lamps will be more illuminated and our Diwali will shine even more.
My dear brothers and sisters, Laxmi is welcomed in the form of good fortune and prosperity in Diwali.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this year
Girls have been considered as Lakshmi in our culture because girls bring fortunateness and prosperity.
Can we organise the honourable programmes of girls in our society, villages and cities this year
Can we honour these Laxmis of India on Diwali this year
There will be many girls and listeners around us who are doing extraordinary work.
Somebody is working to teach poor children, somebody is working to make aware about cleanliness and health, somebody is serving the society by becoming a doctor or engineer, somebody is trying to give justice to somebody by becoming a lawyer.
Our society should recognize such scriptures, honour them and make them proud.
Such honours should be organized across the country.
One more thing can be done.
Share more information through social media about the success of these girls and use the Hashtag of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
We have launched the Self-with Daughter campaign and it was spread all over the world, just like this time we should also launch the Bharat Ki Laxmi campaign.
Encouraging India's Lakshmi initiative means empowering the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said that Mann Ki Baat programme has a great advantage that I have the opportunity to interact directly or indirectly with many familiar and unknown persons.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tayang, has sent me a letter to me and he has written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roeing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year when my exam was finalized, some people asked me whether you read the book Exam Warriors
I told them that I have not read this book.
But again I bought this book and read it twice or three times .
My experience after that was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination then I would have had a lot of benefit.
I believe that if you are thinking about the new version of this book, you must include some more mantras for parents and teachers and some more labourers.
Thank you for reading the book Exam Warriors twice or three times. Thank you for telling me what is the lack of reading and reading.
My little friend has also given me a job and has ordered me to do something.
I will certainly follow your orders.
Whatever you have said that whenever you come to the new version of this book, I will definitely try to write some things for parents and teachers.
But I would urge you all to help me in this work
What are our experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to our small friend and student Alina Tayang in Arunachal.
My dear countrymen, through the press, through television, you will also discuss the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country.
But you know that even I am a common man like you, a common man and that is why I have the same effect on a common life as well as on my life, because I am also one of you.
Then I also heard that speech and also saw the confrontation.
Just a short while ago, he was defeated by Emperor Rafael Nadal, who won the Grand Slam 19 times and the Emperor of Tennis World.
The audience present there welcomed his speech with enthusiasm .
Danil also complimented the winner Nadal and explained how Nadal has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of the past, he lauded his competitive court and put a good example of sportspersonship in front of the world.
At the same time on the other hand winner Nadal also praised Danil's sports .
There is a lot that people of every class and every age can learn.
These are the moments that are beyond victory or defeat when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The ideas of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinay Upata Hartin Nervousy's Mansya Mani Kanchan Sankshan: Janayati Loksya Lochan Anandam i.e., when a person lives at the same time, then that person will not win a good mind
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is really going to tell you for our good.
The debate will continue, the differences between the parties will continue, but if some things are stopped before spreading rapidly then it will be of great benefit.
Those things that grow very fast and spread very fast, it becomes difficult after stopping them.
But in the beginning, if we are awake and stop it then a lot can be saved.
Today, I feel like talking to my dear youth, especially with this feeling.
You all know that the addiction of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit this addiction .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By its consumption in adolescence there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I would like to talk to you about a new topic.
You must have known that recently the ban on e-cigarettes has been implemented in India.
E-cigarette is different from regular cigarettes .
Because of the heat of nicotine rich liquid substance in cigarette a kind of chemical smoke is produced through which nicotine is consumed .
You must have a lot of information about the danger of daily cigarettes , but there has been an irregularity about e-cigarette that there is no danger of e-cigarette .
Aromatic chemicals are used in it to not spread its odour like other cigarettes .
We have seen around us that many households have chensmokers, but still they prevent others from smoking.
The issue of e-cigarette is different.
If someone smokes around us then we understand it only from his residence.
If someone has a cigarette packet in his pocket then also he understands it only from vasas.
However, e-cigarettes are not such that many adolescents and youngsters are unaware and sometimes pridefully roaming around in their books, in their captains, in their pockets and in their hands with e-cigarettes and then they are addicted to addiction.
Young generation is the future of the country.
Cigarettes have been banned so that the drunkenness cannot be destroyed by our youth.
These restrictions have been imposed to save the dreams of the family from getting destroyed, not to bring the lives of the children to the country, not to spread their hands and feet in the society due to the habit of addiction.
I urge you all to quit this intoxication of tobacco and do not have any irregularity about e-cigarettes.
Let us all together build a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that we go to Jim for two hours in the morning and evening as much as possible.
For fit India you will have to stay away from all these intoxications.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that our country has been the birthplace and workplace of many extraordinary people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such extraordinary people, the workplace and these are the people who have laid down their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honored in Vatican City on 13th October.
It is certainly a matter of pride for every Indian and Pope Francis will declare Marium Threasia as a saint on 13th October, 2018.
The work done by Sister Maryam Threasia for the welfare of humanity in our young age of only 50 years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very fond of social service and education.
He built several schools, hostels and orphanages.
He established the Congressation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling their lives and missions.
I once again pay homage to Sister Marium Threasia and congratulate the Indian people, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not just for the entire India but for the world that today we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore Indians have resolved to get rid of single use plastic.
Considering the leadership that India has played in the direction of environmental protection, today the vision of countries around the world has been enforced to India.
I am confident that all of you will be participating in the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way, but a young man of our country has started running a mission in a unique way.
When I got my attention towards his work, I interacted with him on a telephone and tried to know his new experiment.
Perhaps the interaction with them will be beneficial for some other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudman Belviji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word plogging for the first time, it was also new to me.
You are implementing this entire programme in an innovative manner and especially in the way you like the youth.
I congratulate you all.
Friends, This year, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Honble Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing a Fit India Planging Run.
Two kilometers of plogging on October 2.
This programme will be held across the country.
We have heard from the experience of Repudman how to do this programme and what to do in the programme.
With this campaign, awareness about cleanliness is also increasing in the public about health.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step towards eliminating single use plastic, then India will go ahead with 130 crore steps at the same time.
Repudamanji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, to your team and to your innovation.
I would like to give you a little warning about one thing.
In fact, in the next Mann Ki Baat programme, I will definitely tell you about it in detail, but today I am telling you that you will get the opportunity to prepare.
You will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is his birth anniversary.
So, we should start preparations for it from now on.
We have to talk about it in detail, but there is still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can also be prepared.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit 15 places in India.
Program at least fifteen places and one or two night camps .
We must see, understand and experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And when people come on holidays on the occasion of Diwali, I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, you will certainly be happy to know that the World Tourism Day has now been celebrated on 27th September and some of the responsibilities in the world present the tourism rankings and that Indias position has improved in the competitive tourism index.
And it has been possible because of the cooperation of all of you, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we make more efforts, we will definitely be able to get the top among the major tourist destinations of the world when we complete 75 years of independence.
There should be happiness, enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together so that this collectiveness also brings a new strength to the collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the child friends of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper launched an initiative in which he urged the children to send letters to the Prime Minister.
He has also written that if children are given more information about nature then they will be beneficial in the future for environmental protection.
A daughter named Rida Nadaf in Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of a soldier and she feels proud of this thing.
Any Indian will not feel proud of the army personnel
And you are the daughters of that soldier, it is natural to be proud of you.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is 5 kilometers away from his village, so he has to get out of his house soon and is too late to return home.
Therefore, they cannot play with their friends for a long time and they should have a school near their house.
Friends, I got the opportunity to save these letters by taking initiatives by a newspaper.
Suddha was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On the same day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly accepted the event of India.
The implementation of the Constitution began on 26th January, 1950 and that is why we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constitution.
He worked hard for about three years to build the Constitution.
Any area of life, no subject of nature has been left in it.
It is the identity of our Constitution that equality and sensitivity for all.
It is our duty to comply with our Constitution in letters.
Be it a citizen or administrator, everybody should follow the Constitution.
This is the message of the Constitution that no one should suffer any kind of damage.
The draft committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He used to play a big role.
He assured that every section of the society will be benefitted.
On 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana Divas, we remember him and salute him.
Babasaheb has contributed immensely to the countrys prosperity and empowerment.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the death anniversary.
Sardar Patel, who made the identity of the farmer's son to the iron man, has also done an extraordinary task to build the country in the same form.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He also chaired the Consultative Committee for Basic Rights, Minority and Tribals.
But the country cannot forget that nine years ago, on the day of 2611, the terrorist attack on Mumbai had taken place.
Today, the country remembers the brave people, the police and the security forces who lost their lives.
The country will never forget their sacrifices.
He has been decorated to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all humanitarian forces in the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken our social structure and destroy them.
And that is why it is the need of the hour that humanitarian forces remain more aware.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will celebrate the Naval Day.
The Indian Navy protects its maritime coasts.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed in the coastal areas of the rivers.
Whether it is the Indus river or the river Ganga or the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important in both economic and strategic matters.
These are the entrances for the entire world.
This country and our land have immense relations with the oceans.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago, during the period of Malayalam dynasty, the Malayalam king's naval was counted among the most capable navies.
In the extension of the Malayalam empire, his naval lion shared the name of the empire as an economic superior at that time.
Several examples of rubbing naval missions, research journeys are still available in Sangam literature.
Most of the naval navies around the world have been allowed to include women in a very later period.
However, in the Mass naval, and that too, 800-900 years ago, women had made a performance of Mola.
These women were also involved in the entire war.
Malayalam rulers had the latest knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval capabilities be forgotten while mentioning the naval
The territory of Konkan, which is a sea warfare, was included in the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurg related to Shivaji Maharaj were either in the coastal or in the sea.
The naval of Marathas used to protect these forts .
This shrine of Marathas included large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were engaged in attacking any enemy and protecting themselves from the attack.
It is only impossible to discuss Maratha Armara and not to mention Kanhoji English.
He gave a new glory to the Marathas and set up the camps of Marathas in many places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy has performed valour several times.
Whether Goa liberation war or the Indo-Pak war of 1971 .
INS Sumitra, a naval naval ship, helped in quick rescue and delivered many fishermen safely out of water to Bangladesh.
When there was a major flood in Sri Lanka this year in May-June, three of our naval boats immediately reached there and they helped the government and the people there.
The Indian Navy, INS Gadhiyal, had helped humanity in the field of Rohing in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea Government gave us the SOS message and helped our Navy to save the fishermen on their fishermen boats.
On 21st November, the naval INS Trikanda also ran to the warship during a merchant attack on a merchant ship in West Galf.
This is a day of pride and respect for the security forces of the country and this year, the Ministry of Defence has decided to launch a special campaign from 1st to 7th December.
Throughout a week, small children, elderly people, all of them have flagged the nation.
There should be a movement to respect the army across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute flags of the army.
If any of our neighbours and their familiarity are associated with the army, their experiences, their courageous actions, paintings and photographs related to them can be posted here in the Armed Forcesflagday.
They will be able to invite the people of the army in schools and colleges and get more information about the work of the army.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the army.
This is the opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our defence personnel.
The fund is used for the welfare of the families of the martyrs, the injured soldiers and their rehabilitation through the Military Welfare Board.
Let us also contribute to the strengthening of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also hand in hand for their welfare.
My dear countrymen, 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Whatever we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How's alive
It has been thought in our culture a long time ago and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, the spirit of devotion towards agriculture, the spirit of devotion and respect for the soil will be very natural in the minds of the people and the use of several scientific methods has also kept the soil nutrition.
In the lives of the farmers of this country, two things are of great importance, devotion towards our soil and also with a scientific viewpoint.
We all feel proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also aware of modern science and use it in agriculture.
I have heard about the Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, Bhoranj block and the farmers there.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in a imbalanced manner, so that the quality of soil was lowered.
The production decreased due to which the income of the farmers also decreased and the productivity of the soil also decreased.
Some awakening farmers of the village knew the seriousness of the situation and after that the farmers of the village tested their soil and advised them to use the amount of fertilizers, nutritional elements and biological fertilizers.
You all will be surprised to hear the results that the information provided to the farmers through soil health cards, the guidance given to them has shown positive results in implementation.
In 2016-17, the production of wheat increased by one-three-four times and the income also increased by one-four-six thousand rupees.
If we are concerned about crops then we should take care of the soil and we should take care of this land and the dam then it will also take care of ourselves.
More than 10 crore farmers from all over the country have prepared soil health cards to get better information about our soil and yield it accordingly.
We devote Mother Dami but we have thought of how harmful the fertilizer like urea is for the health of this dam
It has been proved by several scientific experiments that cause more urea than required damage to the land.
The farmer is the son of this dam and how will he let his mother get sick
It is time to revive the relationship between mothers and sons.
Can our farmers pledge to utilize urea for our farming by 2022 that will be 75 years of independence
Once the sons of Damdi Mata, the farmers have resolved that the health of the dam and the land will improve rapidly and the production will also increase.
There will be a real change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now feeling that global temperature increases, climate changes.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
Now it is halted after coming to December and it starts getting very cold.
It is our experience that it does not seem to get out of the bed.
However, in such a season, people with awareness work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
But determination and determination were greater than all.
The eight-year-old son was unable to speak, but he took the base of the lease.
Arise at 5 o'clock in the morning, this son used to go to the village households and talk about not open defecation.
This kumhari village has become Open Defecation Free due to the efforts of these children who have been teaching cleanliness everyday by visiting at least 30-40 households.
Every moment, something new is learned.
Today, they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is sports, competitions, social initiatives, our Divyangjans are not behind in any case.
You must remember that in the Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons had won four medals and won the World Cup of T-Twenty Cricket of Blinds.
There are many types of competitions across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Water Swimming Competition was organized in Udaipur.
There are no muscles in 80 percent of their body, but look at their courage, determination and hard work.
He also won the Gold medal in the 70th National Para Waterfalls Competition, with his talent, selected by Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralympics.
They are among the 32 Para Water Strips and will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute and convey my best wishes to the youngster Jigar Thakkar Ji.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of you for enhancing peace and harmony in the society, will give new energy and will enable you to make new pledges.
"Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak from Kanpur to Nirja Singh.
I urge you to once again tell us the best ten of the things you have spoken through Mann Ki Baat in a year so that we can remember that thing again and we can learn more.
We have made a very good information.
After listening to your speech, I feel like putting more emphasis on it, I want to change.
We have the old and old people who have their lives in the village often tell us, do not let us forget the sadness and happiness.
I invite you to welcome the 2018 in the auspicious environment, with auspicious memories, with positive ideas.
Come on, on Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on social media, share positive things with positive India.
Brighten the events that inspire others.
We see the strength and impact of these collective efforts together.
I will certainly try to reach out to the countrymen the experiences that have come upon the positive India in the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with you all for the next month's Mann Ki Baat.
There will be an opportunity to speak many things.
Thank you many
Six days after Deepawali, Chhath Parv is one of the festivals being celebrated with devotion in our country.
In which traditional regulations from diet to dress are followed.
The unparalleled festival of Chhath Puja is completely linked to the worship of nature and nature .
Surya and water are at the centre of the Maha Parva Chhath Puja, while utensils and pottery made of bamboo and soil are useful in these pujas.
The world worships gardens, but in the sixteenth century, it also gives us the essence to worship them, which are certain.
This festival also includes the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Cleanliness of the entire house, along with the cleanliness of rivers, ponds, shores, pilgrimage ghats, all people enthusiastically enthusiastically.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is the festival of conservation, prevention and discipline.
Usually, mines, these are deficiencies and inferior emotions.
But after half of the morning in the morning, it is a special tradition.
This is the reason why Prasad is asking for food that ego ends and ego is a feeling that becomes a hindrance in the progress of a person.
It is natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has been built with the people of the country in 100 per cent of the lines.
Take examples of Khadi and Handloom.
You will be happy to know what is the result of Gandhi Jayanti.
I was told that on 17th October this month, on the day of Dhantriyodashi, a record sale of Rs.
You must have been happy to hear that Khadi and handicrafts will be sold from one store.
During Deepawali, sales in Khadi's Gift Kupan have increased by about 680.
The sales of Khadi and Handicraft Handicrafts have also increased by about 90 per cent this year as compared to last year.
Today, the youngsters, adults, women and every adult like Khadi and handlooms.
I can imagine how many weaving families, poor families and families working on handlooms have benefitted from this business.
But from the past few years, I can say that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi has now replaced Khadi for Transformation.
Khadi becomes an instrument for the poorest of the poor, to make them empowered and powerful by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role in rural industry.
Shri Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experience of Diwali with my security forces and how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shri Tejas Gaikwad has also asked on the Narendra Modi App whether our sweets can be provided to the security forces
We also remember our brave security forces.
We feel that the sweets of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali has also brought me a special experience.
I respect every soldier of the security forces for fighting, dedication and sacrifice for the country, whoever faces difficult and difficult situations on the border, who protects our security forces.
When we get time, when we get time, we should know the experience of the soldiers and listen to their glorious story.
Many of you do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone knows the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace all over the world and their positive role.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam means this world is my family.
It is because of this belief that India has been active in various UN initiatives since the beginning.
You all know that the proposal of India's constitution and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with words "With the Pipal".
India has always stressed on women equality and the UN Declaration on Human Rights is a living example.
All Man R Borne Free and Equal, which was promoted in his national framework, was changed by the efforts of Indias representative Hansa Mehta and later accepted the "All Human Beings R Borne Free and Equal".
If you see it, then it is a small change, but it is a strong idea that happens from it.
The important contribution made by India through UN Ambrella is the role of India in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping operations.
At present, about seven thousand soldiers were connected to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third largest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
The efforts of peace were made from some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, 20 thousand patients were treated in the Indian Army Hospital and killed innumerable people.
The Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also won the hearts of those people.
Indian women have also played a crucial role in building peace.
India is the only country that a few people know that India has sent women police units to Liberia in the Shanti Abhiyan Mission.
And this step of India will inspire the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to hear that Indias role is not only related to the peace mission but also the training of peace drives in 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace Abhiyan, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to go to remote areas and do this work.
His memories blossom the heart of every countrymen.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honoured by Param Vir Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji created a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year, he was appointed as the Force Commander for Operations in Namibia and served him to ensure freedom for that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and bowed to peace.
As a messenger of peace, India always gave a message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everyone should live in peace, harmony and move forward with the vision of creating a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage has been decorated by great personalities who have served humanity with selfless feelings.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call sister Nivedita, is also one of these extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland but Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
The statement means a complete dedication.
Later, he worked in accordance with the name and proved himself.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was the 150th birth anniversary.
Swami Vivekanandji's cars were so impressed that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very distressed by the atrocities in the British Raj.
The British not only made our country a slave but also tried to make us a psychological slave.
It has always been going on to create inferiority by writing less in our culture.
Sister Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked towards awakening the national consciousness and keeping the people together.
He went to various countries around the world and raised voices against the anti-country campaign against Sanatan religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudumari Penn, New Women and Empowerment of Women.
It was believed that his inspiration was sister Nivedita.
Sister Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
We have helped in research and dissemination through our writings and conferences.
This is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
This is the best example of Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
In 1899, there was a massive plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people lost their lives.
Sister Nivedita drained and started cleaning the roads without taking care of her own health.
She was a woman who could live a comfortable life but was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from their sacrifice and helped them in service.
He taught people cleanliness and service through their cars.
He wrote on his grave that Sister Nivedita Hu Gave Har All to India - Sister Nivedita who rested here, who gave you all India.
Undoubtedly, this is what they have done.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the heroes of New India.
It is our concern that the diseases used to occur at adult age and the diseases used to come in the last stage of life and now they are also seen in small children.
Young people also used to have such diseases with exception.
But now our lifestyle has changed.
Such diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
Such diseases in young age i . . reduction in physical activity and changes in food habits .
There is a need for society and families to take care of this thing.
When we think about it, it will be remembered that there is no need to separate anything.
There is only a need to change our habits and change our habits by regularizing these big things in the right manner.
Instead of going to the elevators, the children should get the habit of climbing the stairs.
After dinner, the entire family should try to go with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga will help our young friends, especially in adopting regular lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorders.
30 minutes before the school, the speciality of Yoga is that Yoga is easy and accessible.
And I tell you so much that Yoga can easily be done by any age group.
Ease of doing so that simple methods can be learned and it can be done so much.
There is no need for special instruments and fields.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been good news in the sports sector in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brightened the name of the country in various fields.
India won Asia Cup Hockey Trophy while playing a glorious game in Hockey.
Our sportspersons performed the best sports and on this strength India became the Asia Cup champion after ten years.
Earlier, in 2003 and 2007, India became the Asia Cup Champion.
My best wishes to these hockey teams and all those of their teams, to the countrymen.
After Hockey, there is also a stir in Badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikantan won the Denmark Open Trophy by playing the best sports.
This is his third Super Series Premiere Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, FIFA Under Seventeen World Cup will be organised this month.
Several teams from all over the world came to India and showed their skills on football grounds.
I also got the opportunity to see a face.
The sportspersons were very enthusiastic.
This big event of the World Cup, the whole world was watching you.
I was overwhelmed to see such a big fight and the energy, enthusiasm and fervour of young sportspersons.
World Cup events were successful and all the teams performed the best.
Though India did not get a cup, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of all.
This festival of sports all over the world including India enjoyed and the entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers .
Footballs are indicating a bright future.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, in order to justify the feelings of the people whom I write on Swachh Bharat, I will have to do Mann Ki Baat programme everyday and I will have to dedicate only Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
Some young children send photographs of their efforts and some of the youngsters are in it.
Somewhere there is a story of new initiatives related to cleanliness and some officer's zeal is a news of changes.
Just a few days ago, I received a detailed report in which the legislation of the Chandrapur fort in Maharashtra is a story of the legislation.
There, a voluntary organization named Economic Protection Organization launched a Swachhta Abhiyan at Chandrapur Fort.
In this two hundred days of campaign, people did not stop, they were tired, they worked for the sanitation of the fort.
I was enchanted to see the photo and whoever saw this photo, whoever feels disappointed with the filth of the surroundings, whoever feels disappointed with the filth of the surroundings, whoever dreams of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I want to tell the people that you can see the live images of the youth of the Economic Protective Organization, their hard works, their emotions and their determination from this photo.
Seeing them, the disappointment in us will change into confidence.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, all of you will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
Guru Nanak Devji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is the Jagadguru.
He thought about the welfare of the entire humanity, and addressed all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and women's honour.
Guru Nanak Dev ji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and during this journey, he taught truth humanity.
He interacted with the people and showed the path of truth, sacrifice and duty.
He gave a message of social equality and this teaching was not only spoken but also showed in our cars.
He started anchor, creating service for the people.
The feeling of unity and equality of the people got awakened by eating food sitting together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - remember God, work hard, and help in need.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurubani to tell his philosophy.
In the coming 2019, we will commemorate the 55th light year of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us move on the path of their messages and teachings.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji.
We know that he had built the foundation stone of the unbroken modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels characteristics are not merely transformative ideas, but he is keen to find practical solutions from the complicated problems to achieve them.
He was efficient in realisation of ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made India a cave in one source.
We have ensured that millions of Indians can be brought to the umbrella of one nation and one constitution.
He enabled them to overcome all the difficulties in their decision-making.
Wherever we needed to honour, we respected.
Where there was a need to use force, he used force.
He set a goal and with that goal, he was guided.
It was only possible to keep the country together.
He dreamt of a nation where all the people are equal.
I believe that the ideas of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are always inspiring.
He said, "We cannot stop any distinction of casteism, we are children of all India, we should love the country and have a future on each other's love and goodwill.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still an inspiration for our vision of New India.
And his birthday is celebrated as the National Unity Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Dear countrymen, after the holiday of Diwali, with new resolutions, with new determinations, all of you have come to your daily life.
May my countrymen realize all their dreams, my best wishes
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Mann Ki Baat has completed three years through AIR.
Today, it is 36th.
Most of them are inspiring me.
There are many things to improve the government.
There are also some personal complaints.
And I take half an hour a month, but people are sending their words on Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
It has resulted in sensitivity in the government as well.
This three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a miraculous journey of the feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps in such a short span of time, I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country and I am extremely grateful to the countrymen for that.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba used to say, 'No-Government, Non-Government' mahsanje would result.
This thing has been kept away from the political colors and instead of flowing into the subjects which have been wrapped, a stable mind has tried to connect with you.
I am aware that after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers, intellectuals and media experts will definitely analyze it.
And I am confident that the idea of this kind will be more beneficial for the Mann Ki Baat in the future.
Once I had said in Mann Ki Baat that we should not be able to stay away from the meals so that we need to worry about eating and drinking food as much as we need.
After that I saw that a large number of letters came to me from every corner of the country.
Many social organisations and many youngsters are already working on this.
I have come to know that there are many people who work for the purpose of utilising the food that is given in the silk.
Once I saw one of the Sarpanches of Haryana 'Selfie with Dotter' and I told all of them in Mann Ki Baat.
See, not only in India, but also in the entire world, a big campaign like selfie with dotur has started.
This is not just a social media issue.
This has become a new self-confidence, a new pride for every girl.
A few days ago, I was interacting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people who were going to visit outside, wherever you go, wherever you go, wherever you send photographs and lakhs of photographs came.
It has come from every corner of India, in a way it is a big settlement for those who work in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this Mann Ki Baat that a small event can create a massive movement.
Today, I was thinking about the Mann Ki Baat that had started for three years and several events in the last three years have touched my mind.
Every time it is being considered for the country to go through the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the good things in the society and for the progress of the country.
In my three years of Mann Ki Baat campaign, I have understood and learned from the countrymen.
I bow down to the countrymen with my heart.
Once I had talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that Khadi is not a cloth but a thought.
Once again, I would like to urge you to continue the mission of Khadi.
If we buy khadi then we should work with this feeling that the lamp of Diwali will shine in the house of the poor.
This work will strengthen the poor of our country and that is why we should do this thing.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity and how to handle solar energy
The idea of how to revive the old 20-20, 25-25 and 30-30 years of age is being closed.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri has been closed for 26 years in Varanasi Sevapur but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked to it.
Many people have been provided new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries have resumed their training centres in Pampore, Kashmir and there is a lot to contribute to this region.
Now the resumption of this training centre will help the new generation to build modern methods, weaving clothes and new things in it, and I feel very good that whenever the big corporate houses are present, they have recently started giving Khadi things.
People have also started giving Khadi things while meeting each other.
Cleanliness will connect people's mind.
Our Honble President ji started this work and the entire country joined it.
Be it the elderly, the women, the city or the Khedegaon, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness mission.
When I say, we all see how the Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward towards a resolution.
Everyone accepts this movement, collaborates and contributes to the realization of this movement.
I express my gratitude to the Honble President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its work.
I believe that I am happy that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes and I have seen that some people are constantly working and the results will continue to work till now.
One thing is that we should clean up somewhere, the other thing is that we should not clean up by being aware, but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then there is also a need for a ideological movement.
On this occasion, several competitions took place with the mission of Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children took pictures.
Using our ideas, we have drawn pictures on the subject of cleanliness.
Many people have written poems and these days I post the pictures sent by our children and small children in the social media.
I never forget to thank the people of the media when it comes to cleanliness.
These people have taken this movement with a very good feeling.
They are also leading this Swachhta movement in their own way.
In this Swachhta Hi Seva movement, we can see how much of our country's electronic media and printed media can serve the country.
Just a few days ago, some of my 18-year-old youngsters of Srinagar, Bilal Dar, took care of it.
No, there is nothing like this.
Bilal Dar works for cleanliness from 12-13 years of his age for the last five-six years.
The biggest pond in Asia is near Srinagar, the pond has plastic, polythene, bottles used, waste, waste and cleans the pond.
Bilal Dar is younger than age but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we should acknowledge that the future history is born from the womb of history and it is natural to remember the great men when the subject of history comes out.
This is the month of October to remember many of our great men.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is on 11th October, the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on 25th September.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was the center of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh left his political career and was enchanted in the work of Gramodaya and it is very natural to be respected for his work in Gramodaya when his centenary year is being celebrated today.
When the former President of India, Mr. Abdul Kalam ji was interacting with the youngsters, Nanaji Deshmukh was always talking about rural development.
With great respect, he used to mention the work of Nanaji and he himself went to the villages to see the work of Nanaji.
Like Mahatma Gandhi, Deendayal Upadhyay was talking about the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had brought the entire country together.
Now we should also move forward the mantra of unity by running for unity.
We say very easily, naturally, the speciality of unity and India in diversity.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I would like to reiterate to my countrymen of India, especially to my younger generation, that we are awakened.
Summer holidays are the days of Diwali, we will go out somewhere or the other in our country.
People go to Bahragaon as a tourist and it is very natural.
But sometimes it feels a matter of concern that our people do not see our country and do not know the diversity of the country.
You must go to the outside country, I do not have any opposition to it, but sometimes we should see the places of our country.
If we look at the life of Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam Ji, then one thing is reflected that when all of them visited India, they came to see India and at the same time, they were inspired to live for India and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had made a broad tour of India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
The value addition in tourism will take place at a time when we do not just go to Parulukha as a child-children, as a student and try to understand their life.
I have also got the opportunity to stay in more than four and a half hundred districts. And today, when I assume this great responsibility in India, I am very enjoying the experience of confusion.
It doesn't take time.
I urge all of you that in this vast India, there is not just a declaration of unity in diversity but a storehouse of our unconventional power.
We have many types of food habits .
Even if we keep eating a new thing every day, there are so many types of things that the first thing will not come again.
Now, this is a big strength of our tourism.
I am confident that even if you go out to visit this time, you will take my first mission forward.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you have to meet the people there, send their photographs.
I am thinking that in order to promote tourism in India, what can be the best seven tourist destinations in our state, every Indian should know about those seven special places in our state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we give some information about these places
Can we make this information available on the Narendra Modi App
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
If you think that all the people of one state start giving such a good information then I will tell the government to enquire about the information that has come and make publicity literature about the same seven things that have come from every state.
It means in a way how to promote tourist places through the intentions of the people .
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also become a big and important partner to promote tourism in the country from October to March.
I invite you to this.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
There are waves in my mind.
Something on my mind gets immensely frustrated.
In the end, I am a man like you.
The Indian Army has received two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
For extraordinary reasons, both owners and funds were also martyred to serve Mother India.
You can imagine how the world will get destroyed at such a young age.
But the wife of Martyrs Colonel Santosh Mahadik, Swati Mahadik, took a stand in the mind and was admitted to the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and completed his training and he laid down his life for fulfilling his husband's dreams.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubai, his husband, Mukesh Dubai, was a hero in the army and died for the motherland.
Their wife Nidhi decided that we should be recruited in the army and they fulfilled their determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to be respected for their maternal power and their bravery.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and the festival of Diwali has become a big opportunity for the youth of the country.
The FIFA World Cup competition under 17 years is being held in our country this year.
I am confident that the announcement of football will be heard all around.
Each generation of every age will be interested in football.
It will not be possible that our youngsters have not been seen playing in the fields of schools and colleges in India.
Come on, the whole world is coming to play on the soil of India, then let us make sports a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is the time of worship of Mother Durga.
How the entire environment is full of sacred fragrance .
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the entire country celebrates festivals, on the other hand, there is a news of violence from any part of India, it is natural to worry about the country that our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi.
Sardar Patel, who laid down his lives for the unity of the country.
Our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and equal respect.
We have been listening to 'Ahimsa Parmo Dharma' since childhood.
I had also told Red Fort that violence will not be consumed in the name of faith, be it communal faith or belief in political ideals, be it faith in the person, be it faith in the tradition, no one has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that the people who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence will never tolerate this country and no government will tolerate it.
Everyone has to bow before the law.
Because of thousands of years of cultural traditions, cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, perhaps in 365 days there should not be a single day left that will remain unconscious.
Now we must have seen that our festivals continue according to the nature cycle.
There is a simple relationship with nature .
Most of our festivals are connected to the farmers.
So, first of all, I would like to call you 'Michchami Dukkadam'.
Yesterday, the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society.
In the Jain society, the festival of Parishana is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
On the last day of the Parushana festival is the day of the festival .
This is a unique tradition.
The day of Sanvatsari is a symbol of compassion, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also goes on forgiveness day and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other 's favourite Dukkadam ' .
We have been listening to these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - forgiveness is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama 'The Marchant of Venice' in descriptions of the importance of emotional emotional emotions, 'Marcy is twice blast, it is blasset him that gives and what takes' means that both of them get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated in every corner of the country with great joy.
It is natural to speak on the Ganesh Festival when the topic of Ganesh Chaturthi comes.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi goes on for ten days.
This Mahasana is considered a symbol of unity, equality and righteousness.
Congratulations to all the countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh festival.
Recently, the festival of Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of Onam in India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known because of our social and cultural importance.
At present these festivals are seen being the cause of attraction of tourism .
I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navaratri in Gujarat or Durga festival in Bengal has become an attraction for tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We have to consider what we can do in that direction.
In the series of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated throughout the country on the day of Kanhi itself.
Congratulations to all the countrymen on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and faith for us.
We have to make the festivals of New India a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals are connected to cleanliness in family life.
Preparation of festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to be a social nature.
The public call for cleanliness should not only become an integral part of the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country and in our country.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernization is changing.
Eco Friendly Ganesha has launched a big campaign.
If you look at the YouTube then the children of every household are making Ganapati and they are being made Ganapati by bringing soil.
Some people are colouring vegetables, some are pieces of paper.
Different types of experiments are being carried out in every family.
And when you know new experiments.
Three years ago when the Swachhta Abhiyan was started, it will take three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilet coverage has reached around 67 percent from 39 percent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
A few days ago there was a terrible flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood decreased, dirt spread everywhere.
At that time, the workers of Jamia, Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by Purana in a regular manner.
The sweat of oneself was rotten, all the people came out.
Excellent examples of unity for cleanliness, examples of inspiration for everybody, all the workers of Jamia Ulema-e-Hind.
If this becomes our sustainable emotion then our country can go somewhere.
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, I used to say 'Jal Seva Hi Prabhu Seva', 'Swachhata Hi Seva', 'Swachhata Hi Seva'.
Make a clean environment in the entire country.
Whatever opportunity you get, whenever you get, we should find an opportunity.
But we all come together.
Come together on the day of holiday or on Sunday and work together .
Go to the nearby settlements but work with a movement .
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural political leaders to the government officials, collectors and Sarpanchs to create an atmosphere of cleanliness for 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
On the top of this, a department has been built where after the construction of toilets, you can write your name and the name of that family which you have helped.
My social media friends can run some creative campaigns and actually inspire the world.
The Campaign is being organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which essay competitions, small film making competitions and painting competitions are being organized.
In this we can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age.
You can make small films by your mobile.
You can make a 2-3 minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to join this cleanliness mission.
I would like to reiterate my resolve to celebrate the 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti and that is why from 15th September, the mantra of Swachhta Hi Seva should be reached home.
Some steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Make yourself a part of it by working hard.
You will see how this concept of 2nd October will shine on Gandhi Jayanti.
You can imagine that after 15 days of Swachhta hi Seva, on 2nd October when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated, you will be happy to pay homage to the revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I want to accept my loans especially today.
I would like to express my gratitude to you from the heart and not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time. I would like to express my gratitude to you people that the number of millions of people in the country is being linked through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I get the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
The more you wait for Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for your message.
I am eager because I get something to learn from all of you.
I am grateful to you for your contribution to the new idea of many things.
You are connecting your mobile phones and you become a part of such wrong habits.
Prime Minister ji speaks Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell about my friends that I was always tired of seeing a habit of helping the people.
Once I went to the shopping mall with her.
We make payments at large places without any price, but we deal with our hardworking brothers and sisters show their unbelief.
Doesn't you feel that there is always a relationship with the sellers, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers and those who sell some goods with a pass-force near our house, whenever we are associated with the hardworking people then we feel goods with it.
Not only this, two-five rupees will be reduced and we will have to eat in a big hotel that even the bill does not even see the money.
For him, the question is not about Rs.
He is a poor person and hence he doubted his honesty that there would be no difference in your life by two-five rupees, but he would have thought how much of his small habit would have given him a big blow
I am grateful to you, Madam has given me a message by calling the heart touching phones.
I am confident that my countrymen will also leave such behavior with the poor.
My dear young friends, On 29th August the entire country is celebrating National Sports Day.
This is the birth day of the great hockey sportsperson and hockey magician Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is incomparable.
I would like to remember this thing because I feel that the new generation of our country should be connected to sports.
Sports should become a part of our life.
If we are a young country in the world, then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports is physical health, intellectual readiness, emotional collaboration.
I understand what to do more than that
Sports is a herb that connects the heart in a way.
Today, in the age of computers, I would like to tell you that sports sector is more important than sports stations.
Play the FIFA game on the computer but show something on the outside ground.
The joy of playing an open field cricket is very different than the cricket on the computer.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out then the mother used to say that you would never come home.
Today the situation is such that when the children sit in the corner and watch the games or cartoon films on the mobile, they have to ask the mother when you go out
This was a time when the mother used to tell the child that you have come here today that when will you go out of the child
Our youngsters are happy to note that FIFA World Cup is being organised under 17 years of 6th to 28th October.
Today, while talking about sports, the event that touches the mind last week has happened which I would like to tell the citizens.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl, some of whom were born in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days have been spent in water, these six girls will be the first incident in the world in the waves of the sea.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of those girls
I salute the courage of these girls and I called them to tell all the countrymen this experience.
I will also provide a different place for the Narendra Modi App.
Because we must read their experiences because it is a kind of adventure story, it is a story of adventure and I will be glad that my best wishes and blessings to these daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate the Teachers Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the former President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
It is an important quality of the teacher to awaken creative feelings and knowledge among our students.
When we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we make a resolution together
Let us bind each one with a resolution for five years, show the way to prove it and we will be happy to enjoy the fulfilment of the resolution after five years.
There is such an incident in the lives of every teacher that his efforts have transformed the life of somebody.
If we collectively try, we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I live in Mumbai for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is a matter of economic infrastructure not only in India but also in the economic world of the entire world.
On 28th August 2014, the scheme was started with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow this scheme is completing 3 years.
30 crore new families have been connected, bank accounts have been removed.
Today, I am happy that the poor of the society have been made a part of the country's economy.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that the money will be used for the children.
You can do some good work in the coming days.
Not only this, the poor who looks at RuPay Card in his pocket feels like a rich person who has this credit card in his pocket, my pocket has a RuPay Card.
That feels a respected one.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the coming days and the insurance cover of the bank accounts that have been opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been removed.
The Prime Minister's Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) has created a lot of confidence in the poor today.
If something happens on the main basis of the family due to an insurance of one rupee in many families, then his family will get Rs. 2 lakh.
Today there is no time but I will tell the people of the bank to upload my gov.
My dear countrymen, once again I wish you all the best.
Thank you very much.
The mind of man is such that during the rainy season he feels very charming .
Animals , birds , trees , nature - all get excited by the arrival of rains .
But this rain sometimes takes a rare form and then it feels that there is a great strength to bring destruction in the water.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes the terrible form of floods and earthquakes in natural calamities is terrible.
Whatever changes are taking place in the changing cyclone and environment, there is also a very negative effect.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, are facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Whether it is the army personnel or the people of the air force or the NDRF, the army forces or the army forces, all of them are bowing themselves in the service of the disaster victims during this period.
Farming, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electrification and connectivity are all affected by this thing.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, we all can prepare timelines for our work according to the weather estimation so that possible damages can be avoided.
When I prepare Mann Ki Baat, I see the people of the country preparing more for it than me.
I have received a lot of letters on the subject of GST, many phone calls have come and people are still expressing happiness about GST and also expressing curiosity.
One of these phone calls also tells you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I speak from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, on the same date of last month, GST has started in our country.
Can we tell you what the government had expected about this decision and the results are getting after a month or not
I want to hear your views about this.
It has been almost a month since GST has been implemented and its benefits are also visible.
I am very happy that when a poor person writes a letter about how GST has reduced the prices of the poor and how the goods have become cheaper, I am very happy.
Anybody who lives in the far-flung mountains of Isnya writes that if the GST was not known, it was not a matter of fear, but now it is learning about it, it seems as if the work is easier than ever before.
All these facilities are not only available but they are also getting support for economic pace.
The speed at which this change has been done, the speed at which it has been transformed, the newly registered has created an atmosphere of trust in the entire country.
Scholars in the field of economics, scholars in the field of management and scholars in the field of technology will either place Indias use of GST as an ideal system in the world.
It will become a hair study for many universities in the world.
Because there has been such a huge change in such a big way and with the participation of such millions of people, it is a big pace of success to implement this tax in such a huge country.
All the decisions have been taken together by the States and the Centre with consensus.
As a result, every government has given priority expectation that GST does not have any excess burden on the cost of the poor.
You are very well aware of the fact that all the information on the GST app is available on the mobile phones about what was the price before the GST and what was the price in the new situation.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, to all the departments, to all the central and state government employees for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new authentic culture.
In a way, there is also a mission of social reform.
I once again salute crores and crores of Indians for their smooth performance.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of revolution.
In a way, in the month of August, there have been several such events which have been specially linked to the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But very few people would have known that Dr.
Yusuf Mehr Ali gave it.
Our new generation must know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What can be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had prepared to take a pledge to free the entire country from the British rule.
This was the time when the people of India, in every corner of India, in every corner of the country, be it villages, cities, be it educated, illiterate, poor or rich, everybody had become a part of the uit India Movement.
Replying to Mahatma Gandhi's call, millions of Indians were swinging their lives in the struggle with the mantra of 'Karo Ya Maro'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and left their books.
The great men like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan played a key role.
Gandhiji has two different forms in both the non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement 1920 and 1942.
The form of 'Association Movement' was different and in 42 years such a situation came, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karo or Death'.
People were supported, people were capable, people were determined, peoples struggles were behind all these successes.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that the first freedom struggle of India was established in 1857 when I saw the leaves of history slightly connected.
The freedom struggle that started from 1857 was going on every moment in some part of the country till 1942.
This long-term period has awakened the spirit of freedom in the minds of the people of the country.
Everyone was committed to do something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed, but the resolution has not changed.
People used to come and join, leave, new people came and the country was trying every time to break the rule of the British.
This was decisive for five years.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
In 1947, we became independent.
Today, the year 2017 is on.
The incident took about 70 years.
During the period, the government came to the forefront.
The system has become, changed, deaf and increased.
Everyone has tried in their own way to free the country from problems.
Efforts have been made to generate employment in the country, to overcome poverty and to achieve development.
He was also suffering from his own way.
Success was also achieved.
Aspirations have also been raised.
Like 1942 to 1947, it was five years of pledge.
Similarly, I see that the five-year period of the journey of 2017 to 2022 is now in front of you.
We will observe this 15th August, 2017 as a pledge and when we complete 75 years of independence in 2022, we will complete that pledge.
Today, the announcement of 'Karenge Ya Marenge' is not just to be linked to this pledge of New India, but to compete with this pledge.
We have to live and fight with this pledge.
Let us run a great campaign from Sankalp to Siddhi on 9th August this year.
Every Indian, social institutions, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations, everybody should make some or the other new pledges for New India.
One such resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will become a part of this resolution and now we are not anywhere else or not online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends living in the online world to come forward in their innovative ways to contribute to the creation of a New India.
Using technology, we should take all these things like video, posts, blogs, articles, innovative concepts.
Give this campaign the form of a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be launched for young friends on NarendraModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will spread and spread it at a wider level.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister of the country on 15th August, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am just a day.
Certainly send your views on MyGov or on NarendraModiApp.
I read it myself and will try to take this idea in the time I get on 15th August.
On the last three occasions, I have heard a complaint about my speeches on 15th August that my speech is far away.
I will complete it in 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a socio-economics in Indias economy.
And that economics will never be less written.
Our festivals and festivals are not just a occasion of joy and joy.
Our festivals are also a medium of social reform.
But at the same time, every festival of ours is directly related to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Raksha Bandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganeshotsav, then the fourth moon, then Ananta Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Diwali will come together and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their meanings.
And in these festivals a natural joy is also mixed.
And if you want to talk about the economy then hundreds of families start making reserves through small household industries several months before the festival of Rakhi.
From Khadi to silky dresses, how many types of dresses are being prepared and nowadays people are giving more preference to homemades and household guards.
Business of thousands of people is linked to these festivals that make rashes, sellers, sweets and sweets.
Its direct relation is with the poor families who make small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor people associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to issue environmental issues.
And he has urged me to speak about the eco-friendly Ganesha statue in the context of Ganeshotsav, so that people will be able to select the idol of soil from now on.
First of all, I am grateful to these aware citizens.
He urged me to discuss this subject beforehand.
This year, the Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
And I am sure you will be associated with this resolution when I have been telling this thing since a long time ago.
And this will provide employment to the poor artisans and the poor artists who make this statue and will fill the stomach of the poor.
Let us make our festivals connect with the poor, connect with the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals become a festival of economic benefits for the poor and the joy of earnings.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for many festivals and festivals.
We are proud and proud of our daughters.
Just a few days ago, our daughters showcased their sports in the Womens Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
It was very good to speak to them, but I realized that there was a lot of slaughter in their minds that the World Cup did not win.
This burial was seen on their faces.
I told them a different analysis of myself.
I said, Look, nowadays there is a time for the media that hopes are increased in it.
It is so increased that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change into anger.
We have seen many such sports in which if India's sportsperson becomes absent then the country's anger will be expressed on those sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and say such things that are very painful.
But this was the first time that even though our daughters did not win the World Cup, the 125 crore citizens of the country took the burden of the defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the young generation of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
Once again I congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Every countrymen should make a pledge and every countrymen should formulate a plan to prove that pledge in the next five years.
Let us come together and wait for the next time, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Climate is changing.
This year the summer was also very strong.
However, the rains have come down on time and the next move is going on smoothly.
In many parts of the country, there is a comfortable weather due to heavy rains.
After the rains, there has been relief from Kahili in the last few days.
And all of you have seen that whatever range in life, whatever tension in life, whether it is personal life or public life, the arrival of rain will change our mindset.
The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and zeal in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world also the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who do .
Babasaheb Ambedkar has studied and he must have seen that Lord Jagannath ji had a lot of praise for the temple and his traditions because it was inherent in social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with a sacred spirit.
Now it is the festival of Eid.
My best wishes to all on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitrah.
The month of Ramzan is the month of donating punya.
It is a month of enjoyment and as much enjoyment as you can.
Let us all come together, let us feel the treasure of joy with inspiration from these holy festivals, let us take the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan, a very inspiring incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages. In a way, the population of brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more.
During this period of Ramadan, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also provides assistance for these individual toilets and they have been given Rs. 17 lakhs under this scheme.
You spend this Rs 17 lakh for other facilities of the village .
On this auspicious day, I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming the society into an opportunity for the welfare of society.
His one thing is also very inspiring.
And the most important thing is that they freed Mubarakpur from defecation.
You know that Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free in our country.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the government and the people for fulfilling this work.
Then somewhere the body, the mind and the body of the body fall.
The subject of cleanliness is the same.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We will have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to take care of it.
We will recall the good inspirational events.
And I am happy that now cleanliness has not been a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of society and the common man.
And when the people sitting in the government also take this task forward with public participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, a very good incident came to me, which I would definitely like to tell you.
This is the incident in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration had taken a big deal from the people's participation.
A 100-hour tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Build toilets in 10 thousand houses in 71 gram panchayats in 100 hours .
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and the administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages became defecation free .
I congratulate the people of the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village in Vijayanagaram district. They have put forward a very inspirational example with relentless hard work.
Her awareness towards democracy is commendable.
And democracy is not a system but it is also an edition.
Awareness in mind is the price of liberation.
Regular awareness about democracy is essential and that is why they used to remember those who attacked democracy and had to move forward in the good directions of democracy.
It was the time of 1975-25 June that no democratic lover would forget.
No Indian will be able to forget.
In a way, the country has been transformed into tunnels.
The opponents were pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, along with Jaiprakash Narayan, were immediately drowned.
The judiciary was not able to escape from that terrible shadow of the crisis.
Newspapers were completely unemployed.
Today's journalism, the students of the world, the people working in democracy, are constantly trying to enhance the awareness of democracy by remembering that black period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in a hurry at that time.
When the emergency was completed one year, Atal ji had written a poem and he describes the condition of that time in his poetry.
My dear countrymen, today the honor of every Indian has raised the world's pride.
21st June, 2017 - the entire world is going to have Yoga.
From the sea to the mountains, people came to the sun in the morning through reception yoga.
Any Indian who is not proud of it.
It is not that earlier Yoga was not practiced but today when Yoga was built in the threshold of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity for Yoga.
The Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level at Machu-Pichchu, the world heritage site in Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the IFFIL tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India gave a different dimension to India's friendship by practicing Yoga on the Afghan Maitri Dam i. e.
Yoga class was organized along with Yoga Masters at the United Nations Headquarters.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have recorded a new world record by doing yoga at one time.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time I got the opportunity to do yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also practiced yoga in Siachen where the temperature was 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Be it our Armed Forces, the Border Security Force, the ITBP, the CRPF, everybody has made Yoga its share with his work.
On this Yoga Day, I was saying that three generations, because this is the third International Yoga Day, I was saying that I should send my photographs of three generations of family yoga together.
Some television channels also raised this issue.
I have received several photographs in this regard, some of them have been collected on the NarendraModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my favorite programme.
For the last few years in Kerala, P.
N.
An excellent programme is organised by Panikar Establishment and people are observed as a habit of reading books, awareness about reading public books.
Now I also remember the thing that I had settled in my mind.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we do not want to give a wreath, we should give a book or welcome it by giving a handloom.
Khadi's handloom so that Khadi gets a boost.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, we all had a habit but after coming here I had a habit.
However, he went to Kerala and once again he became aware of the habit.
And now I have started giving information to the lower people in the government.
We can gradually become a habit.
The life of the flowers was very low.
Once he took it in his hand and then put it in his hand.
But if a book was given then in a way it would have become a part of the house, it would have become a part of the family.
When I am talking about this, how historical were these things.
Last year when I went to England, the queen of Britain Elizabeth in London invited me for food.
How many years Lotali, but Rani Elizabeth has maintained the romance given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was showing it with great pleasure.
And when I was looking at him, he was urging me to touch him and look at him.
A small visit to Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change in routine and whenever they say that they have to become rich in vaccines.
However, we have to tell these things, we should continue to try.
Now I can't say where I went and whoever gave me a Pushpguch, I will deny it.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there are several works.
But I have developed a habit for me that some of the letters I read every day and that is why I get the opportunity to connect with the common man.
There are different types of letters, different types of mankind letters.
Recently, I will get to read a letter and I feel that I must tell you about it.
Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a housewife in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, far from south India, sent me a letter.
And if the letter was happening then he used to write that he thought of taking some or the other economic initiatives in his family, keeping in mind the education of children, so that the family would get some financial assistance.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards bringing some goods from the market.
Some people asked, I have registered it myself, I would like to tell the people of the country that you should also get the opportunity to get the opportunity to get the e-Governance E-Governance on the Internet.
There is a new kind of arrangement for visiting GeM.
Those who want to supply goods to the government, who want to sell brooms, who want to sell a chair, who want to send a table, they can register their name on it.
Those people who register under EEGM, they see all the departments of the government.
Because of lack of agents many things get cheaper .
This Arunmozhi Madmani registered the goods that can be supplied on this website of the Government.
And the letters he wrote to me are very interesting.
He wrote that once he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote the list of what I can provide on e-GEM and I got an order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be the demand of the Prime Minister's Office
This is an opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arunmozhi did not write to me letters, I would have often noticed that in the e-GEM system, a household is working far away and its goods can be bought from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-GEM
I want those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way that they should add themselves to it.
I believe that this is an excellent example of the Minimum Government and the Minimum Governance and what is the objective of this thing - Minimum Price and Minimum Ease of Doing Business, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also be proud of the success we have in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga then our dreams are far away from crossing the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in sports and science.
Today, India is pushing its flag not only on the ground but also on the space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellites with Cartosat-II satellites.
In addition to India, the satellites include about 14 countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.
And Indias Small Satellite Campaign will help in the field of agriculture, in the context of natural disasters.
A few days ago, you must remember that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And the satellites that India has launched so far were the most weighing satellites.
And the newspapers of our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
So you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the space sector.
On 19 June 1 thousand days were completed on Tuesday .
You all know that when we successfully got the place in the segment for the Mangal mission, the entire mission was for a period of six months.
If we are sending photographs, giving information, scientific information, then we are working for more time than the determined life.
Our scientific journey is a matter of great importance to complete a thousand days.
At present, in the sports sector, we are also seeing that the performance of our youth is increasing.
Recently, Indias Badminton Feature Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open Competition and enhanced the dignity of the country.
I congratulate him and his trainees for this victory.
Just a few days ago, I am sportsperson P.
T.
Usha was also present at the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Usha School of Athletics.
The more we encourage sports, the sports will also help.
Sports plays an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports in holistic personality development is unparalleled.
There is no shortage of talented sportspersons in the country.
If the children of our family are interested in sports then they should be given an opportunity.
They should not be motivated to study by lifting them from the ground and locking them in the room .
They should also study and show them a glorious performance in it, but if they are interested in sports, they should be encouraged by schools, colleges, family and surrounding people.
Everyone has to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget this year's summer.
However, it is awaited for rain.
Today, while talking to you about this, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Muslim community.
Prayer , spirituality and Dan Dharma are given very importance in Ramzan .
We are extremely fortunate that our ancestors have created such traditions and today India can be proud of this thing, we can make the 125 crore people proud that all the communities of the world are in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God are also people who reject God.
There are also idol worshippers and people who oppose idol worship are also there .
Every kind of ideas, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition is here and we have imbibed the art of living with each other.
And in the end, be it religion or sect or be it ideology or be it tradition, all these things give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in taking this path of peace, unity and harmony forward.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
I am very happy to say that most people have responded to it.
Individually, everyone showed me the zeal of talking about your mind.
I have not read everything, I have not heard the message of everybody, so many things have come.
However, after looking at these messages, some people have tried to learn music, some people try to put their hands on new music and some people are trying to learn new things by using YouTube.
Some people are learning Pak, some are learning dance, some are learning drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Some people are trying to understand the nature and live with nature.
I am very happy that I want to listen to you a phone call.
"I speak Diksha Katyal.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have been made to gain independence, how many sacrifices have been made by the freedom fighters.
I was very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who had achieved a lot of things at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give a message to the new generation about this.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their youth in a hurry for independence, many young people climbed on the throne of fashion.
And that is why we breathe in an independent India.
You must have seen one thing that in the freedom movement, those great men who have done a great job of writing, studying and enhanced Indias independence.
A few years ago, I had visited Andaman Nicobar.
The Cellular Jail there was also gone to see .
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote a book 'Majhi Janmathep' in Turunga.
He used to write poems, write on the walls.
They were locked in a small room.
They would have tortured the freedom fighters.
When I read the book 'Majhi Janmathep' of Savarkar, I got inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound lighting programme that is very inspiring.
There will be no such state in India, there will be no language in India, no one of whom has spent his youngness in the cellular tunnel in Andaman for the sake of freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar, the people of every language, people of every region and every generation have tolerated this torture.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - one must care about a world one will not see.
It is our duty to take care of the world that we do not see.
Open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe in the fresh air and get a new consciousness.
When our body comes in contact with those five great elements, a new conscious place comes in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced it, but we never take care of it, we do not bind it in one thread, in one thread.
You must see that when you are in touch with your natural condition, there will be a new consciousness within you.
And therefore, the global mission to connect with the nature of 5th June must become our own mission.
We are getting some benefits from our ancestors who protected the environment.
Now if we protect the environment then the future generation will benefit from it.
And if you look at Atharvaveda then it is the biggest guiding book of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
Mother Bhumi: Sons Aham Prithviva: It was said to us.
It is said in the Vedas that the purity that we have is due to the earth.
Earth is our mother and we are her son.
If we recall Lord Buddha then one thing is really visible that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his gains of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana had happened under the tree.
But it needs to be added in modern words and with modern logic.
Through Yoga, we have linked the world to one source.
The way Yoga connects the body, mind, brain and soul, it is bringing together today.
Due to today's lifestyle, running and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress-free life.
Since very young age, this stressful state of mind has been found to be illuminated.
In such a situation, Yoga has an important role in leading a stress-free life.
Yoga is a way of ensuring health and strengthening.
Yoga is not just exercise .
It is possible through Yoga if you want to experience the journey and interaction with the health of the body and mind and the thoughts.
Two days ago, I have written letters to all the governments and leaders around the world.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to yoga, some bucks.
Gradually the work will move forward in that direction.
I have received a notice and I congratulate the valuable imaginators.
It is a very psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day of this year and urge you to do yoga together on this day, three generations of family members.
Azi-Azoba , mother-father , son-daughter-three generations should do yogasana together and upload their pictures .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow there will be a beautiful mixture that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful for suggesting this imagination and I also feel that the way we had launched the mission of self-with-daughter and had a very interesting experience, the photographs of Yoga in three generations together will be appreciated in the country and in the world.
You must send a collective photograph of those three generations of people where three generations are performing yoga on the Narendra ModiApp and MyGov.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow will be the pictures that will ensure a golden future.
I invite you.
International Yoga Day is yet to have a three-week break.
In a way this immunity is a movement for health conservation .
I invite you all to participate in this.
When you gave me the responsibility of your chief servant, when I got the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on 15th August of my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, my journey has been going on from different parts of India and I have been reminded that Modi has kept an eye on what Modi has done.
Because of this, I had a lot of telephone calls and I would have thought of what he said.
But I am grateful to them for bringing this thing to mind.
You also listen to this telephone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji television and social media, I often see that wherever you go, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, according to your request, people have collectively taken cleanliness as a mission.
Adults are also involved in this but children are also aware of cleanliness.
Children often see adults stopping the road from waste.
The cleanliness drive you started from the valleys of Kashi has taken the form of a movement by your inspiration.
Your statement is true that wherever I go, the government system is not only working for cleanliness but recently it is also being celebrated in the society.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, a large number of cleanliness programmes were taken up.
Just a few days ago, I had gone to Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a massive cleanliness campaign.
But I didn't realise these two things.
But after this phone call, I thought that it was true.
You can imagine how much I am happy to remember this thing and the country is looking at these things in a smooth way.
What would be my pleasure to have a relationship with my visits to cleanliness
There is a habit of preparing the rest for the welcome of the Prime Minister, but cleanliness has become a major thing in it.
It is also pleasant and inspiring for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine is very good but I have to think about it.
However, it is true that this movement should stand up and it is a good thing that instead of giving memories and memorials, it is a good thing to enter the amuk tonne waste from the cleanliness mission.
It will be the work of such a great humanity.
Once we started treating this waste as wealth, many new methods of waste management will come to us.
The youngsters associated with Start-ups will also come with new schemes and bring innovative means.
The Government of India has decided to open a massive mission of waste management with the help of people representatives of the cities with the help of the governments in the states.
On June 5, on World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities will be able to get solid waste and liquid waste collection.
Two types of wastes will be made available, one of them will be green and the other will be blue.
Two kinds of waste is being produced - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
This waste will be kept in four thousand cities and we should put the dry waste in blue and wet waste in green waste while following the discipline.
For example, the waste that comes out of the kitchen, the skin of the vegetables, the remaining food, the shield of the egg, the skin of the skin, all this is wet waste and put it in green colored waste.
The other kind of wastes include trash papers, petals, iron, glass, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken dustbins, rubber, metals and dry waste.
I am confident that we should develop such a culture and we will have to take new steps towards cleanliness every time and we can fulfil the dream of Gandhijis cleanliness.
Today, I am proud to mention a thing that even if only one person decides his mind, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is one such thing.
Citizens have worked hard for about 80-90 weeks and transformed the Versova beach and thousands of tonnes of waste wastage was distributed and today the Versova beach became clean and beautiful.
Versova Resident Volunteer (VRV).
Brothers and sisters, I am told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Reasi Block, the administrators there and Jammu and Kashmir for giving them an excellent example.
And I have also been told that the entire movement was a woman living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He carried out a torch morcha for awareness and inspired the people from homes and streets.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those mothers and sisters, and congratulate the administrators there who have started the best by making a block free of defecation on the land of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, the performance of the present government from the newspapers, from the TV channels, from the social media has been observed since last month-fifteen days.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
This three-year tenure has been traced on every basket.
Every section of the society has analyzed it.
Somewhere in it, somebody has given support, somewhere in it has recorded some errors, I believe that all these things are important.
I also express my gratitude to the people who have given a critical and important reaction.
If the light is laid on errors and deficiencies then there is an opportunity to improve it.
This movement is very important for an aware nation and for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and I have the same effect as a good White and a good White.
It seems as if I am sitting in the house and sitting in the family about the things of the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, whenever you meet again, you will have reached every corner of the country, the weather has changed, the results of the examinations have come, the new student life will start and the arrival of rain will come with a new joy and a new fragrance.
Come on, let us all move forward in such an environment with love for nature.
My best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like the seekers, the people who have suffered for the society are often possessed of the problems that the government does not look at.
Every time the information that comes for Mann Ki Baat is a detailed analysis in the government.
What are the information, what are the complaints and what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that human nature is to give advice to others .
If someone gets cough by going on a bus then immediately after coming to another tells you to do this .
Consultations, suggestions, as if something is in our nature.
Most of the information providers are those people who try to reach me, who really do something or the other in their lives.
They are trying according to their minds, strengths, capabilities, conditions and whenever these things are reflected, I felt that these are not normal information.
Some people also do information for this reason, because they feel that if the same ideas are working there, if other people listen to it and get a broader form then many people can benefit.
And that is why they naturally want to mention it in Mann Ki Baat, all these things are very positive in my view.
First of all, I express my gratitude to the people who are most of the information of the workforce and those who do something or the other for the society.
Moreover, whenever I mention something, I am very happy to remember some such things.
In the last time, some people had informed me about Mann Ki Baat, food was being sold and I had mentioned it.
And when we mentioned that on the NarendraModiApp, many people from every corner of the country used to use innovative ideas to avoid the supplied food.
I had never thought that today, especially the younger generation has been working for several years in our country.
We have heard that some social institutions have been doing this for the past few years but I later understood that the youth of my country are involved in this work.
Many have sent me a video.
There are several places where the bank of Pollutions is going on.
People collect their poultry, collect vegetables and take the required people from the bank.
Those who give satisfaction also do not feel humiliated.
This is an example of how the work is done with the help of the society.
Today, the month of April is going to be completed and the last day is.
The States of Gujarat and Maharashtra will be established on 1st May.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two States have consistently tried to guide new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and inspired the lives of the great men in every field of the society and inspired us to take our state, our society, our city and our family to the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022, while remembering these great men.
We have to make a plan to take that resolution and we must move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The summer that takes place in our country in May-June has driven out to experience it in March-April this year.
And when I was taking the information of people on Mann Ki Baat, people have informed about what to do during the summer days.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern about birds.
He said that in Varanda, we should keep water on the batch and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very interestingly.
Once they came to know that why they used to fill this water 10 times a day and see that the utensils which have been kept in it have water or not and they keep watching whether the birds came or not.
We feel that this is his sports, but indeed there is a unique experience of awakening this sensitivity in the minds of young children.
You also ever see a little bit of animals and birds enjoy a new joy.
A few days ago, Mr. Jagat Bhai has sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and they have expressed concern about the reduction in the number of leopards but what they themselves used to protect them in the form of campaigns, what they tried to do, however, they have described in this book.
However, in our country, animals and birds, nature have co-existed with them. However, it is important that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru of Dawoodi Bohra Samaj, Syedna Saheb, had completed 100 years.
He lived for 103 years.
And on his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community had launched a very big campaign to save the spectacles through Burhani Establishment.
I got the opportunity to launch it.
He had distributed about 52 thousand burd feeders in every corner of the world.
He has got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are so busy, we are supposed to be driven by the newspapers, we are driven by the vegetarians, the vegetarians, the postmans, but we forget that we are the days of summer, if we want water to be asked if we want water.
Young friends, I have to make some mistakes with you too.
I sometimes care that many of our younger generations enjoy living a comfortable life.
Parents also keep on serving them in a safe condition.
Some others are also from the other end, but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the exams are over and there will be plans to enjoy the holidays.
Despite summer vacations, heat, it feels slightly good.
But as a friend, I want to talk about how to leave you.
I am sure some people will definitely use and tell me.
If you use this holiday, I make three proposals, then it is a very good thing but try to do one of the three.
New space, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes watching something on television or reading in books or listening to oneself and feeling that thing by oneself , there is a difference of land and honour in both .
Experiments should be positive and comfortable .
We are from the middle class families and from the happy family.
Whenever you feel, I don't say that do it again, do it once.
In the evening, taking your football, taking volleyball or taking any sports literature, go to the poorest of the country.
You will find that you will never get the joy of sports before playing with those poor children.
When children living in the society get the opportunity to play with you, you have ever thought about how big change will happen in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel like going again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several NGOs are working servingly.
Sometimes there are very summer camps .
Personality is of development, there are many kinds of developments, they can participate in it.
However, at the same time, you feel that you have done such a summer, have done a course of personality development, you should reach the people of the society who have not got this opportunity and learn what you have learnt.
You can teach them how to do.
I am also worried about the fact that technology has come to reduce the distance and has come to end the limits of technology.
Everyone has become busy on the other hand due to technology.
Today there is a competition era.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing, the idea of doing something is a good thing and also to do it.
But also look at the fact that the human component that is within us is not tortured or not, we do not go far away from human properties.
Can we have a little emphasis on skill development
Trying to spend time with yourself, away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi or Punjabi.
And if we see a country with so many diversity, we can find somebody learning around us.
If you cannot swim, learn to swim, take pictures, no good picture will come, but try to put something on paper.
The sensitivity within you will have to be expressed.
Sometimes we say small things that we do not want, we should learn.
You see all these new experiments, these skills will give you happiness and will expel you from what you have built in a framework.
Friends, Do something outside Chakori.
This is the opportunity to create a life.
And you would be thinking that if all the exams are over, you will be able to learn when you go on a new turn of the workforce then that opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you want to learn magic then learn the magic of the wives.
Keep showing our friends and friends magic.
Try to know something that you do not know, you will definitely benefit from it.
You will get consciousness of the human power within you and will become a very good opportunity for development.
I tell you from my experience that we cannot imagine how much we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages, new campuses.
After going to one place, stay for three days and four days.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days, four days.
You will be able to learn a lot from this.
When you go, you must send me photographs there.
Have you seen new
Where are you going
You can share your experiences using Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a great opportunity.
New generations are almost getting rid of cash transactions.
You can also earn through this scheme. You have thought of it.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you are downloading the Bhima App, you will also be using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you get it done by 20 people in a day then you can earn 200 rupees till evening.
Businesses can also earn, students can also earn.
And this scheme is on 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
He had become a symbol of VIP culture in a way, but the experience was that Red Diwas used to be on the vehicle, it used to be on the car, but gradually he dragged his head and this VIP culture was deepened in the head.
Now only red light has gone, so that no one can claim that the red light that has been inserted in the head has come out.
I have received a very interesting telephone.
In this telephone, he has also expressed his heartfeltness, but this time there is such a telephone that the common man does not like this thing.
He feels a kind of inferiority in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak Shiva Choubey, from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear a wet paper in which I was very proud to hear that every Indian is a VIP on a road, and I was also happy that today my time is as important as well.
I don't want to get stuck in traffic and I don't want to stay for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to thank you for this decision.
Going to Lal Diwas through government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we have to remove it from our minds with a lot of effort.
If we all make aware efforts together, we will be able to get rid of it.
New India's concept is to increase the importance of EPIs instead of VIPs in the country and when I call EPIs instead of VIPs, my feeling is clear - Every Person Important.
Every individual has the importance and importance of every individual.
If we accept the significance of 125 crore Indians, we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians, then how much power will be united to fulfill the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that we should recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It gives us energy and motivation.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of the 125 crore nation building saint Ramanujacharya.
Because of some reasons we got stuck so small that we were thinking for a long time.
For other countries around the world, centuries will be of great importance.
But India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate the memories of thousands of years and thousands of years ago.
Imagine a little .
Even today, there is a lot of difficulty in breaking the social system.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
He himself used to do those who wanted to be untouched by his conduct.
Thousands years ago, he had made a movement to enter his temple and had successfully entered the temple.
How fortunate we are that in every age a great man has been born from our society to eliminate the evil movements of our society.
While celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, we should inspire them to awaken this spirit of social unity.
The Government of India will also release a postage stamp in memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I respectfully bow to Saint Ramanujacharya ji and pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is another significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar whenever the theme of Labour Day comes out, there is a discussion of labour and workers.
And very few people would know that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect given to the workers today.
Babasahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saints and social reformers of Karnataka in the 12th century.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to visit a function.
It was a programme to dedicate the collection of his vows.
In the Kannada language, he had said - 'Kay Kave Kailas' means that you can achieve the calamity of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work.
In other words, Shram is Shiva.
I repeatedly talk about 'Shratai Jayate'.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thangdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The ideas of Buddha seem to be very relevant when the world faces the problems faced by violence, war, destruction and weapons.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated on behalf of the United Nations on this great anniversary of Buddha Purnima.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Their memories will be brightened.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capability of the satellite and its related facilities will be very helpful in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
This is an appropriate example of our commitment towards South Asia.
In most parts of the country, many families will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those who have been examined, there will be some stress-free environment and those who are still going on exams will have a little tension in their homes.
But this time, I would like to say that in the past, I heard what I had told the students through Mann Ki Baat.
At the time of exams, these things will definitely be useful to us.
Today is March 26.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh .
An unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Wang-Brothers is a historic fight against otherwise.
Today, on this important day, I extend my best wishes to the people of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should be progressed, developed and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a cooperative partner of Bangladesh.
There is a good friend and we will continue to play our role in peace, security and development in this entire region by shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud that Rabindranath Tagore is a shared heritage in his memory.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is also the nation-singer of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian person who won the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British gave him a nighthood.
When in 1919, when the British killed the citizens in large numbers in Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who raised their voice against this incident.
This was the same period when a child of 12 years of age had a unique effect of this incident.
In adolescent times, the brutal massacre of the Jallianwala Bagh had given a new inspiration to those children laughing in the fields, in the gardens and in the gardens.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat Singh is the inspiration for all of us, the sons of all of us.
Three days before today on 23rd March Bhagat Singh ji , his colleagues Sukhdev and Rajguru were put on foot and all of you know about that incident of 23rd March .
Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were satisfied with the service of Mother India at that time, there was no fear of death.
He sacrificed all the dreams of his life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still an inspiration for us.
The story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be incomplete.
A few days ago I got the opportunity to go to that place, I feel that there are specific spots in that land and I will tell the youngsters of the country that whenever we get the opportunity, when we go to Punjab, we must go to the graveyards of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Matushri of Batukeshwar Datta.
This was the time when the hope of independence, its intensity, its scope was increasing.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had done Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April 1917.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhijis ideas and Gandhis style were seen during the Champaran Satyagraha.
This was a crucial turn in the entire journey of freedom struggle, especially in the perspective of struggle.
This was the time when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Ahmedabad mill workers ended and Mahatma Gandhi's ideas and style of functioning were seen deeply.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he inspired the country by visiting a small village in Bihar.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our mind.
Imagine a person returns to India in 1915 and only two years of work .
The country did not know them, they did not have any effect, it was just a beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to work at that time.
Champaran Satyagraha was such an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organizational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to identify the pulse of the Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi's words, to unite and motivate the poorest of the poor and uneducated people to struggle against the British rule, to bring them to the field for fighting, to showcase all the wonderful powers and that is why we feel the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi.
We can learn this from him and the time was that when we heard the names of the big leaders, Gandhijis, Rajendra Babus and Acharya Kripalani sent them to the village.
And the British did not know what was the method of Gandhiji's work, struggle was also happening and new construction was also happening.
One side was conflict and the other creation.
On the one hand, the prisoner used to swing himself in creative work.
This is the reason why the foundation for New India will be laid by the desire to transform the 125 crore countrymen.
New India is not a government programme or announcing any political party.
New India is an appeal to the 125 crore Indians.
There are many people who often go to the hospital, serve the patients, there are many who run for blood as soon as needed.
Many people worry about the stomach of hungry people.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
People's service is well-known in our nerves.
If we look at it collectively and look at it in an organised form then it is such a great power.
If every citizen decides that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides that my responsibilities will be fulfilled honestly, if every citizen decides that I will not use petrol and diesel a day a week, it is smaller to see.
You will see that the dreams of this country, New India, the 125 crore people of the country will be fulfilled in front of your eyes.
It means that every citizen should follow his citizen's religion and follow his duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude today.
In the last few days, there has been an atmosphere in our country that people participated in digital payments and digital movements.
After demonetisation, digital payments have grown in different ways.
Only two-and-a-half months have passed since the launch of BHIM App but till now about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to go ahead with the fight against black money and corruption.
125 crore Indians will pledge to make digital transactions in this year.
We have announced in the budget.
If they take this task for the 125 crore countrymen then there is no need to wait for a year.
This work can be done in six months.
2,500 crore digital transactions, if we are paying fees to the school then we will not fill the cash, we will fill it digitally, we will make digital payments in the journey, in the air travel.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digital fairs have been organised for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programs have been done .
There were also twenty-four plans.
Approximately 1. 5 lakh people have been benefitted under the Bhagwan Consumer Scheme.
70 thousand traders have achieved the benefits for them .
On the occasion of the completion of 100 days, a big event will be held in the end.
There is a provision for a large amount of exemption.
I am confident that we will propagate Bhima App in the days we are still in our hands for Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
Let us participate in how cash cash can be used less and how to reduce the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to say that every time I seek information from the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are several different types of information but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time.
Honble Prime Minister, My Namaskar, first of all, I congratulate you that you have won the elections with great votes.
I would like to tell you about my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness themselves.
I go through that river every day where most people pollut the river by putting waste in large quantities.
This river flows from the Rispna bridge and comes to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a News Paper.
See, brothers and sisters, how much trouble is the girl who is educated in eleven.
What kind of anger is there in the river after seeing the waste.
I consider it a good symptom.
This is what I want. I want to create a fury in the minds of the 125 crore Indians.
Since the Swachhta Movement has started, people have got awareness.
Everyone has been positively connected to it.
Now this campaign has taken the form of a movement.
Cleanliness has increased.
It has a different significance for awareness and active participation.
But cleanliness is more related to habits than the movement.
This movement is a movement to change the habits and to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can happen in a collective manner.
It is difficult to work but we have to do it.
I am confident that the feelings that the new generation, children, students and youth of the country have been awakened are indicative of good results.
Today, I will tell all those people who are listening to the singers from Mann Ki Baat that the message of singing should be the message of each one of us.
Have we ever thought of how much we do in this real food we we wear.
Have you ever imagined that it is not such a thing that it can fill the stomach of the poor if it is not finished.
This is not a subject that has to be explained.
When the food increases to the child in our house then she says that the child should eat as much as he wants.
There are some or the other attempts but the sadness about it is a sympathy.
This is injustice to the poor.
The second issue is that if there is a saving, then there will be financial benefits of the family.
I do not want to speak much about this, but I feel that awareness should be increased.
I know some youngsters who run such a campaign.
He has prepared a mobile app.
Where such food is supplied or fertilizers, they speak to other people and use it sufficiently.
The youth of our country are making such efforts.
You will find such people in every state of India.
Their life also inspires us not to spend food and increase the food as much as you want.
Look, there are ways to change and those people who are aware of health often say that keep a little empty stomach .
I will tell the countrymen that sadness is not an impossible disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and then the treatment starts .
Its first mantra is that instead of pressing sadness, open it.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and teachers openly what happens to you.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness occurs more to the students living in the hostel .
He doesn't come to the food table.
Why does he do this, have we noticed that
We know that this is the first step towards sadness.
If he avoids staying with all the family and goes to the corner alone then keep in mind that it will not happen .
Look at the people with whom he speaks openly, he will be in touch with them.
Inspire him to express his smile and open the tumor in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can become the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases like this depression attacks the ability of fighting , adventure , decision making and destroys this capacity .
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from depression and if you are sad then you can get you out of that mood.
There is another solution.
If you are unable to open your close friends then do one thing and go to such a place where the work of service is going on.
If we try to understand their grief with service, then there will be a new self-confidence in our mind.
By serving someone with others , by serving someone with selflessness and by serving them with selflessness the stress of mind becomes easy .
Well, Yoga is also a good way of keeping the mind healthy.
Yoga is very useful for liberation from stress , liberation from pressure , joyful mind .
21st June is International Yoga Day.
Prepare from now on and celebrate the collective Yoga Festival in millions.
If you want to make some information about Yoga Day, then you can reach me through my mobile application.
We should do so that we can compose songs and poems in Yoga so that we can easily reach this subject to the people.
However, in the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is sure that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
He is also responsible for the family and also for the economic responsibility of the household and sometimes there is injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
During delivery, during pregnancy, maternity cycle, which was available 12 weeks earlier, will now be given 26 weeks.
In this regard, two or three countries in the world are ahead of us.
India has taken an important decision for our sisters.
Its original aim is to take care of the newborn who is a future citizen of India.
If she is taken care of her in childhood, she gets the love of her mother, then tomorrow this child will become the glory of the country.
This will also improve the health of mothers and hence about 18 lakh women will benefit from this important decision.
May the life of all these great men inspire us to make a resolution for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year-Partipada, New Year, greetings to you all.
It is time for the farmers to start the production of crops after the spring season and the fruits of their hard work .
New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country in different ways.
New Year is welcomed by Gudhipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Cheti-Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh province, Jud-Seetal in Mithila region of Bihar, Satwani in Magadh region.
India is a country of innumerable diversity.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Many thanks.
Winter is over now.
The spring has entered the life of all of us .
The pearl of mango which is the fruit of summer season is visible in the spring itself .
At the same time, yellow yellow flowers of pomegranate in the fields revive the minds of the farmers.
The dried flowers of palsy indicate the coming of Holi .
Amir Khusro has described this moment of change happening in nature very interestingly .
Amir Khusro writes, "Full Rahi Saraswati becomes gross, Ambawa foot, Tesu Phule, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
When the nature is happy, the atmosphere is happy, humans also enjoy this season.
The festival of Basant Panchami , Mahashivaratra and Holi fills the color of joy in human life .
In the atmosphere filled with love, brotherhood and humanity, we will give up the last month of Falgun and are ready to welcome the month of Chaitra.
Spring season is the confluence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for this thing that whenever I ask for your opinions and suggestions before Mann Ki Baat, I get a lot of information.
Thank you for showering your gratitude for showering Indias pride.
Be it poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connectivity with the world, knowledge and information delivery, science has underlined its importance.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day for Indias life.
Our scientists have raised Indias mind in front of the world with pride and we all know that in the last few years, ISRO has successfully completed several missions.
In the last few days, ISRO has established a global record in the space sector after successful deployment of Mangalyaan under Mars Mission on Mars.
This success has to be called historic not only for ISRO but also for the entire country .
ISRO's coast-effective-effective space program has become a wonder for all over the world and the world has also complimented the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is extremely important, Cartosat 2D is the satellite of India and this satellite will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure development, information about development and urban development planning.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water sources are there in the country and how can they be used
It is also a matter of joy for us that the leadership of this whole mission has been done by our young scientists , our women scientists .
This great contribution of youngsters and women is an important aspect of ISROs success.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I congratulate the scientists of ISRO.
These scientists have maintained the objective of using space science for the service of the common man, for the service of the nation and are recording new records.
Whatever we congratulate these scientists and their entire team, they will be less.
Scientists of India have done this.
The capability of this missile is such that even 2000 kilometers away, there has been a missile to attack India, but this missile will destroy it in space.
When we see some new technologies, some new scientific discovery, we are happy.
Those who do not get the same answer, they do not stay healthy.
And if we observe the journey of human excitement for thousands of years then we can tell that this development journey is not completely stopped anywhere.
It creates new science and new technologies and gives birth to a new era of every technology, every new science.
My dear youth, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often said from Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the attraction of science.
The country needs many scientists.
Today's scientists can become the cause of a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organized a different kind of competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
Societies were invited to useful researches.
Sometimes the problem reflects the importance of science to find answers.
In 2005, there was a high rainfall in Mumbai, the Mahapur came, the sea was also filled and there were many difficulties.
Whenever there is a natural crisis, the biggest crisis is that of the poor.
Two people worked with their minds and developed a system of housing that will save homes in such a situation, save households, save water from coming home and save diseases caused by contaminated water.
The system is also being driven.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
In the last few days, the emphasis on DG-Dhan has increased.
Especially the younger generation has a habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe this is a good symptom.
In the last few days in our country, Bhagyawan Consumer Scheme and Digi-Dhan Business Scheme have received good support.
It took about two months, every day 15 thousand people are getting a bucks of one thousand rupees.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a mass movement has been welcomed all over the country.
It is a matter of great pleasure that today, 10 lakh people have got the benefits under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 50 thousand businessmen have got the benefits and more than Rs.
There are more than 100 consumers who have received one lakh rupees in the form of a reward.
There are more than 4 thousand traders who have got Rs. 50-5 thousand bucks.
Shri Santosh, from Mysore, has written on the Narendra Modi App that he received a award of Rs. 1000 in the Bhagwan Consumer Scheme.
But I feel that he has written an important thing to reach you.
He has written that when he got a bucket of Rs. 1000, he remembered that a poor woman had a fire in her house and all the stuff was burnt in the fire.
Santosh ji, our love and our work are giving us satisfaction.
We have done a great inspiration.
Brother Sabir, a driver of twenty-five years in Delhi, has now been linked to digital transactions and the fortunate consumer scheme of the government has got a levy of one lakh rupees.
A young student from Maharashtra performs Pooja Nemade, Post Graduate Course, how RuPay cards and e-wallets are used in his family and the experience of enjoying it reaches others.
How important is the award of one lakh rupees for them, but they have taken this task as a turn, and they are connecting others with it.
This movement has a very valuable role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work, for me, is anti-corruption cadre of the country and anti-corruption faction.
In a way, you are a soldier of righteousness.
On 14th April, a huge amount of outstanding amount of Rs.
There are about forty-five days left.
Recalling them, we should learn to download at least 125 BHIM Apps.
Learn how transactions happen from it.
Particularly learn those small and retail traders around you.
On this occasion, Babasaheb Ambedkars Jayanti and Bhima App give special importance to this.
And therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
BHIM App has to be delivered to 125 crore hands by going to the households, by connecting everyone.
This movement that has started for the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in many urban habitations, several sports and many cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has contributed immensely to the roots of the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
I would like to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled the cereals with hard work.
This year there has been a record production due to the hard work of the farmers of our country.
All the records are telling that our farmers have taken the records of the past .
This year such crops have been produced in the field that everyday it seems that Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of grains have been produced in the country.
This is more than eight percent of the previous record in the name of our farmers.
This is an unprecedented success.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that along with traditional crops, the poor of the country should take care of the production of pulses because the poor get the most proteins from pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and planted pulses in about two and a half lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but also the service of the poor of my country by the farmers.
I have a request and a prayer is that my farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for special gratitude for the way my farmers have suffered and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, from the government to the society, from the institutions, organisations, from everybody to everybody, some or the other initiatives are going on.
In a way, everybody seems to be aware of cleanliness.
The government is also making constant efforts.
A programme of senior officials of 23 State Governments under the leadership of our Secretaries was organized in Telangana, under the leadership of our Secretaries.
What is the significance of the work of direct cleanliness in the closed rooms of the state of Telangana
Toilet Pit Empting Exercise was organised on 17 and 18 February in Hyderabad using it .
Six household toilet pits were evacuated and cleaned and the officers themselves showed that the tune pit toilets used can be used empty and used again.
He also showed how comfortable toilets are being built using these new technologies and there is no hesitation in cleaning it while emptying it, there is no hesitation in the mental obstacles.
As we clean up others, we can clean up a toilet pot.
And this is the cleanliness of the toilet pit that we consider as a fertilizer, it is black gold in a way.
We can see how waste to wealth is produced and it has been proved.
A standard twin pit toilet for six people's family is filled in about five years.
After that the waste can be removed easily and left in another pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste collected in the pit was dissolved.
Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are rich in nutritional elements and are considered to be a very good fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken such initiatives.
Now a special programme on Doordarshan has started.
The more such things will be spread in it, the more it will be benefitted.
Different departments of the government are regularly organising Swachhta Pakhwada.
Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will take forward two more departments of Swachhta Abhiyan in the second month of March.
We are sure that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy and self-confidence starts increasing.
We welcomed the performance of our Persons with Disabilities at Rio Para Olympics.
He is proud of the success of these Divyang colleagues.
I often believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, are courageous, are determined.
Every moment we can learn something or the other from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or space science, women in our country are not behind anybody.
A few days ago, our women's team won the silver medal in the Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy competition.
I extend my best wishes to these sportspersons.
Women's Day is celebrated all over the world on 8th March.
There should be an increase in awareness and sensitivity in the family and society about the importance of girls in India as well.
The mission 'Save the price' is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it has not been just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this initiative.
This initiative has participated in thinking about this vivid issue in every corner of the country.
We have brought about changes in the mindset of people about the old customs that have been going on for years.
It is a matter of great joy when we get the news that the festival was celebrated after the birth of a girl.
In a way, positive ideas about girls are becoming a cause of social acceptance.
I have heard that in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kuddalore district has put a ban on child marriage practice under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the 'Muligi Bacha-Muligi Shiksha' scheme, along with orphan girls will be able to ensure that they get education.
In Madhya Pradesh, the education campaign for every household, every household, every village and every household girl is underway.
In Rajasthan, initiatives are being taken to inspire the girls who have left the school to bring them back to school and to inspire them for education.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed according to local requirements.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: "Woman, he is powerful, he is a woman of India, he is a woman of India, he is a woman of no work, he is an officer with all of us, my dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to interact with Mann Ki Baat.
We were also actively participating.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
Reminding India's Constitution, the duty of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and our commitment to democracy, this festival is a celebration that in a way, the edition of democracy on the generations to come and makes it aware of the responsibility of democracies.
However, the widespread discussions of the rights and duties of the citizens in our country are still not there.
I hope that at every level, the more important rights are given, the more important duties are given to them.
On this day, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we salute the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country for two minutes.
On the day of January 30, at 11 o'clock, this two-minute silence should become a society, a country.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who were awarded with different bravery awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Special Seva Medal.
My special request to the youth of the country is that you are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing or do you know the heroes who have received this honor at this time and you should write two good words about them and reach them to your friends.
When we know about the bravery and bravery of these heroes, we feel surprising, we feel proud and inspired.
While we were happy to read the news of the 26th January being celebrated everywhere, the soldiers in Kashmir had to lose their lives due to avalanches to protect the borders of our country.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young brothers and sisters, you are aware that I have always been telling you our Mann Ki Baat.
Every month of January, February, March and April is the time of a big slim in every family.
Almost every household has a test of one or two children but all the families were buried under the burden of that examination.
Then I felt that this time was appropriate to interact with my student friends, their parents and teachers, because for many years, wherever I go, wherever I meet, the children's tests are very careful.
There is a strange mental condition in every household that the family is worried, the students are taking care of, the teachers are in discourse.
When I was going to talk about it, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, sent questions, sent some information, the problems and difficulties that we faced.
I would like to express the ideas that I read all of them in my mind today.
I got a telephone message of creation.
Listen to you what the creation says, Sir, I would like to tell you that during the days of examination, there is a very terrible atmosphere in our society, our homes and neighbours.
That is why the minds of the students do not get up and we get sad.
I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy
The question is true, but it will be in the minds of all of us.
There are very few people who are present in the exams.
For most of them the exams were pressured.
It is true that you have to decide on the pleasure.
Please, joyfully, the exams will get the same spinach fruit and the time will come to the forefront of the pressury that will bury.
Therefore, I believe that you should meet the examinations, as if it is a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play its role with zeal in taking this festival to complete.
Seeing the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, all these three-four months are conducted.
In these three-four months, according to your traditions, change the atmosphere of your family in accordance with the time of festival.
And that's why I will tell you, Smile More, Score More.
In a stressful state of mind all the doors are closed and nothing can go inside from outside and can not come out .
The process of thinking stops and these things are burdened.
And where do you have no knowledge, lack of information and hard work
But when there is tension then your knowledge and knowledge that is with you gets suppressed under it and tension only takes place on it.
It is important to keep in mind A Happy Mind is the Secret for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes we don't look at the exams from the right point of view.
It is our mindset that there should be a question of life and death.
Whatever you have studied throughout the year, it will be a test about the same.
Your entire life will not be bored there.
This is not the test of how you have lived, how you are living and how you want to live ahead.
Besides the exams conducted in the class, you must have gone through several cases of sequence.
Then let us get rid of such evils and let us all face the country's former President, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge I face in today's times of education has become a centre of education.
Markets are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress on the minds of the students.
I want to know about the current approach of the education system and your ideas about the future.
In fact, he has answered in his question, but Richa wants me to make some opinions on this subject.
The qualities and qualifications have a limited use.
If you believe in these things, then the Mark will be behind you and you will never need to run behind them.
You will be able to use knowledge in your life, your pledge will be used, your self-confidence will be used.
When you go to a lawyer to fight your biggest fight, do you see its mark sheet
Its experiences, knowledge and prosecutors are seen there.
Therefore, these burstings sometimes stop us from going in the right direction.
Rachaji has also spoken of the ongoing competition with others.
This is a great mental fight.
I say that the examples related to sports are easy to understand.
Most of the successful sportspersons have the specialty that they have their own competition.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
His journey has been going on for twenty years continuously, he knows his own records, he knows that he is moving forward by defeating himself.
This must be a wonderful thing because they have followed the path of competition with themselves rather than competing with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you ask yourself about the same question, I could study for two hours before, and now I could study for three hours.
Earlier, it used to be delayed to wake up early in the morning.
Doesn't you feel sleepy because of the stress of the examination first
He further said, "My mother did not learn a lot.
However, he used to stay with me and had to leave mathematics from me.
I would only tell the parents that they should focus on three things, acceptance, teaching and time.
The parents would have experienced that the expectations of their teachers and their children are at the root of many problems.
Your burden will also be removed.
I was present there and I saw that he did not ask any question about the health of the patient.
He came and started listening to Vinayodi shouting.
In four-five minutes, all the climate was sick.
Ervi keeps the patient scared by speaking about the disease that goes to meet .
I want to tell the parents that sometimes we are very familiar with children.
Have we ever thought of giving children a happy, smiling and sports environment during the examination
Do that, the atmosphere will change.
I have received a phone call of another big Kamali.
He says, Namaskar, Prime Minister, I cannot tell myself the name because my childhood was the same as I did.
I had tried to copy once in my childhood.
And when I tried to copy directly, I was caught in it and many of my neighbours suffered a lot.
These short-cut roads become the reason for copying.
You must have heard this several times.
I will also tell you the same thing again.
Even if you see in any way the effects of copying will be seen .
If you spend the same creativity and that time on the issue of the examination then it may not be necessary to copy it.
I have come to a phone call saying, "Namaskar Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I am a student of 12th, so I want to ask you some questions related to the board examination.
My first question is about the increasing tension during these tests, how can it be reduced
In the days of examination, if I talk about sports and sports, your teachers and your parents will be on me.
He said how Prime Ministers are telling children to play during the exams.
Because in sports, we are commonly aware that the focus on studies is decreasing.
This idea is basically wrong.
The problem is rooted there.
Look at the sky after coming out for two moments in your practice , look at the trees of Avatibhovati , lighten your mind and then sit in your room for study .
What happens for five minutes but give this rest time to yourself .
You will see that the work is going on even more.
Everyone would like to know whether or not, but my experience tells me this.
For this there is no need to sit in the room .
Stand in the open skull, go to the skull, breathe for five minutes and then sit in practice .
Some people understand that if you wake up very late at night then you will be studying too much .
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as body needs .
Your efficiency will increase overall.
When I go for election campaigns, sometimes my voice is sitting.
I had come to meet a folk singer during a similar meeting.
He asked me, "How many hours do you sleep
But it does not mean that you keep sleeping continuously.
However, the people of your house will be suppressed to me.
It is a very big medicine to keep mind, brain and body aware.
Yes, young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of the examinations and I will be stuck in my mind.
Somebody thinks, perhaps my speech will help in removing the tension of your mind.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not suppress the things I have spoken.
If it is accumulated then do it or do not do it, otherwise it will become a burden.
I am also aware of the fact that you have told your parents not to wear the weight of expectations on children.
Conflict your determination with yourself and believing yourself.
My best wishes are with you.
To cross every basket give the form of a festival to that basket .
Then there will be no examination.
You go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, on February 1, 2017, the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard is being completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
The Indian Coast Guard, along with 126 Self-made ships and 62 aircraft, is the fourth largest coast Guard in the world.
Coast Guard personnel are ready to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime territories of the country which are guided by these ideals.
Last year, the people of the Coast Guard took pride in making our country clean along with their responsibilities.
Thousands of people participated in this.
He is indeed acknowledged that he has taken care of the cleanliness of these coasts along with the safety of the coasts.
Very few people would have known that not only men in our coastal forces, women are fulfilling their responsibilities with their shoulders and successfully fulfilling their responsibilities.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are aeronauticals, observers, handling the overcraft.
Today, when there is a question of coastal security at the global level, I convey my gratitude to the Indian Coast Guard on its 40th anniversary to safeguard the coast of India.
On 1st February, the festival of Basant Panchami will be celebrated.
It is considered to be the time of the worship of the school.
Not only this, this time is inspiring for the heroes.
The same inspiration is seen in the song My Rang de Basanti Chola.
On this auspicious occasion, I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while propagating Mann Ki Baat, Rashtriya also has a new color in it with its innovations.
Mann Ki Baat provides a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. My best wishes to all of you.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that the poor should accept us if we don't want our favour.
St. Luke has written in Ganspel, Yesun has not only served the poor but has also praised the service of the poor and this is true empowerment.
A story related to it is very popular .
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple .
Many rich people came and they donated a lot.
Thereafter a poor widow came and he put two copper coins in it.
If we go to see the same way then what is the value of two copper coins
The surprising feelings of the devotees standing there .
Then Yashun said that the widow has donated the widow the most and the others have donated a lot, but this woman has donated everything she has.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Varanasi, which was the penance place of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of His Excellency Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
Today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Ministers, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never forget the contribution made by Atal ji.
Under his leadership, the country has also been proud of in the field of nuclear energy.
Whether it is a party leader, a member of Parliament, a minister or the Prime Minister, Atal ji made an ideal in every role.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
As a worker, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Many memories are awakened to my eyes today.
When I tweeted this morning, I shared an old picture on it, I would certainly understand how Atal ji's affection would be found in the form of a small worker.
Today, on the day of Natala, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn from each other and understand.
In order to promote this, the central government's encouraging scheme for customers and small businesses is being launched from today to make it a habit of e-payment to get the strength of mobile banking.
Bhagyawan Consumer Scheme is a scheme to promote consumers, while Digi Dhan Business Scheme is a scheme to promote traders.
This scheme will start from today and will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 people will get a bucket of Rs. 1,000 per day.
On 14th April, there will be a huge release of one day from a week to one day for such customers, in which lakhs of rupees will be disbursed, after three months, Dr.
This is the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and on that day there will be a gathering in which crores of rupees will be given incentives.
Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for businessmen.
Businesses should participate in this scheme and include customers in order to make their behavior cashless.
Independent interests will also be given for such traders and these benefits will also be in thousands of numbers.
Besides, businesses will continue to do their own business and they will also get the opportunity to win a bucket.
This scheme has been formulated by keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens at the centre.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these borrowers.
The poorest of the poor can also buy luggage through a feature phone or a common phone using USSDs, sell goods, provide money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this Buxis scheme.
Even in rural areas, AEPS can buy and sell and win accents.
30 crore citizens can soon join the Buxis scheme.
This is very simple, the more easier we send a message from the votesup, the more easier it is.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to see that awareness about how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 per cent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The businessmen will certainly be able to guess how big this decision is.
Those traders who are doing digital transactions, will provide online payments instead of cash in their transactions, such traders have been exempted from income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
A committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes on their own and have started implementing them.
Somebody told me that the Assam government has decided to pay 10 discount on filing of property tax and trade licence fees through digital.
The branches of rural banks, which will take at least two digital transactions by 75 of their consumers during January to March, will get a discount of Rs. 50,000 by the government.
He also announced an outlay of Rs. 5 lakh under Best Panchayat for Digital Transactions by the Government to 100 Digital Transactions by 31st March, 2017.
The Government of Assam has announced a discount of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who are fully digitally paying for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Farmer Shiromani Scheme for the farmers.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all those who have undertaken this kind of initiative.
Several organisations have successfully experimented to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the villages.
Somebody told me that the fertilizer-related company of Gujarat Narmada Valley, Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited has installed POS machines where fertilizers are sold for the convenience of the farmers. In just a few days, 35,000 farmers have purchased 5 lakh fertilizers of fertilizer through digital routes and all this has happened in just two weeks.
It is a matter of gratitude that the fertilizer sales of the company have increased by 27 this year as compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the scope of informal sector has increased in our lifestyle and we are aware of the fact that most of these people are given the money, the amount of work or the wage cash, and that is why the labourers are being exploited.
80 rupees are available where one should get 100 rupees.
At the same time, they are also getting the benefits of other benefits.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy for us.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made a lot of progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of the digital movement.
Our youth can empower this region with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, we all must join the country with full strength in the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people to give their suggestions and suggestions before every month Mann Ki Baat.
80 to 90 per cent of the suggestions received on MyGov and Narendra Modi App are related to the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I shared them in three parts.
Some people have written in detail how the citizens have to face the difficulties and irregularities in the suggestions given to me.
The other kind of people have written that even if such a good work is going on for the welfare of the country, such a sacred work is going on, how a new path of fascination is being discovered.
The third kind of people have written that the fight should continue in support of what happened.
The number of citizens insisting that corruption, black money should be completely eliminated and strict steps should be taken when required.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have helped me send a lot of letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal noted that this step taken to completely stop the transaction of black money is commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like military forces.
Several such fountains have spread that the words written on the notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the notes of two thousand rupees will also be canceled, the notes of 500 and 100 rupees will be canceled.
However, after listening to all these evils, the minds of the people of this country remained stalled.
Not only this, many people came to the ground, they used their skills and intellect to bring the true face of those who spread foolishness to the ground, proved that fool was wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
I salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 125 crore Indians are standing with you, nothing is impossible.
Jana Janadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this magnificence of corruption and black money.
I feel that there should be a comprehensive discussion in the House in this regard that the fight against corruption and black money is going on.
If the work of the House had been done then it would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading all kinds of concessions to political parties, they are completely wrong.
The law is equal to all.
Whether it is a person or an organization or a political party, everybody should follow the law and everybody has to do it.
Those people who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in finding the errors of the government.
There is also a question of repeated changes in the rules.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, who has participated in this period of inequality and corruption, how much will their strength be
When I decided to fight such people, they started new efforts every day to defeat the Buddhist government.
On the other hand, many citizens have also written letters to discuss the illicit behavior and the various aspects of discussion.
The common man is giving more information than the information that comes from the government system.
The success we get is due to the awareness of the common man.
In order to provide such information, the government has prepared an e-mail card and it can be sent to it.
I am extremely grateful to all those who write such letters and have faith in their letters and blessings.
This is not a complete stop.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of fatigue, there is no question of stopping and the blessings of the 125 crore citizens for which they get.
We must be aware that there is a law in the context of Benami Property in our country and the law was enacted in 1988.
He had kept it in the basana.
We expelled it and implemented the Effective Anonymous Property Act.
This law will show its effect in the coming days.
We have been at the top priority to do whatever we have to do for the welfare of the country and for the welfare of the people.
Indias rankings in the World Banks Industry Report have improved.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the World Innovation Index 2016 and have jumped 19 places in the World Banks Indo-Performance Index 2016.
The assessment of several reports is in such a way that India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country got angry with the session of Parliament.
Everybody expressed his anger in line with the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed their displeasure over it.
But in such a situation, sometimes some good things happen and the mind gets satisfaction.
There was a good work in the Gadarol, which was going on in the Parliament, but the country did not pay attention to it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that a bill related to the campaign that my government has been moving forward for Divyangjans has been passed in Parliament.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this and I thank them on behalf of crores of people with disabilities in the country.
Our government is also committed to Divyangjans.
I have individually tried to speed up Suddha mission.
I wanted the Divyangjans to get their rights and get their respect.
By winning four medals in Paralympics, our Divyang brothers and sisters renewed our efforts and confidence.
Because of his victory, he elevated the country's dignity and also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable heritage and strength like every citizen of the country.
I am happy that after the passage of this Bill, they will get more job opportunities.
The reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has enacted a new law as per the UN views.
It covers 14 categories.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we will be proud of the fields of sports.
The Indian Cricket Association won 4-0 against the United Kingdom.
Some of these young sportspersons have performed commendablely.
Our young sportsperson, Karan Nair, has done three centuries.
L.
Rahil played 199 races .
Virat Kohli, the Karnadhar of the Kasoti Sangh, also led a good leadership while making a good deal.
Indian Cricket Associations of Spinner Golden R.
Ashwin was announced by ICC as the Cricketer of the Year and the Best Cricketperson in 2016.
My heartfelt congratulations to all these.
In the Hockey sector, there has been a good news and good news after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey Association has won the World Cup.
After 15 years, the Junior Hockey Association has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to young sportspersons for this achievement.
This is auspicious for the future of the Indian Hockey Union.
Our women sportspersons have also performed well last month.
The Indian Womens Hockey Association won the Asian Feature Competition and recently earned bronze medal by Indian women in the Asia Cup event below 18 years ago.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the sportspersons of Cricket and Hockey teams.
My dear countrymen, the coming year of 2017 may be a year of new happiness and zeal, all our resolutions should be fulfilled and we should achieve new heights of development.
This new year should give the poorest of the poor a chance to live a happy life.
My best wishes to all my fellow citizens for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I went to India-China Separ to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher part of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP, the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time it goes, but the experience of this Diwali was different.
125 crore people of the country who dedicated this unique kind of Diwali to the soldiers and dedicated it to the security forces, the same reflection was reflected on the faces of those soldiers and the feelings were filled with joy.
Some poems, some pictures, some cartoons, some people made a video.
And when I read this letter, I was very surprised.
These letters are full of emotions.
At the same time, there was a notice on My Gov that could a coffee table book be made by collecting selected things
A soldier from our armed forces wrote to me that the Prime Minister, the Holi of our soldiers, Diwali, every festival is on the border.
It seemed like we are celebrating Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feelings you have expressed about our armed forces in this Diwali will be confined to just a few occasions.
I urge you to take this habit as a society, as a nation, to take care of the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of our army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago, Sarpanch of the state of Jammu and Kashmir had visited me.
He was a member of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Council.
He had come from different parts of the Kashmir Valley and about 40-50 people were there.
I got the opportunity to speak to them for a long time.
He had come up with issues regarding the development of his village.
There were some demands for them and when our dialogue began, the environment, law and order situation, the future of the children came out in a natural way.
It was a matter of discussion that schools were set on fire in Kashmir and I saw that they had the same pain as they were suffering from all our countrymen.
He says that the future of the children is not in school but in the future.
I urged them to pay attention to the future of these children.
A few days ago, the board examination was conducted and the children and girls of Kashmir, about 95 percent of the students and students of Kashmir conducted this examination.
I would not only congratulate him for his enthusiasm but also thank his parents, relatives and his teachers and Sarpanchs of all Gram Panchayats.
Dear brothers and sisters, When I asked you for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that everyone has sent information on the same subject.
Everyone was telling us that we should elaborate on the notes of 500 and 1000.
I was also guessed that in our daily life we have to face many kinds of new problems.
The path of getting rid of the diseases we have been facing for 70 years cannot be easy.
I can understand the difficulties we face.
Such a huge country, such a huge amount of currency, billions of notes and this decision.
The whole world is looking at the barracks and every economist analyzes it.
All over the country, the central government, the state government, the departments of local institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and friends are connected with the spirit of dedication.
Despite many kinds of tensions, they are working with a very calm mind, considering this task as a sacrifice of service to the nation as an attempt to transform it.
When will the night be completed
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such events appear everyday through television, newspapers and discussions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all these colleagues who have worked hard in this great sacrifice.
Identify the strength only when success comes after the bitterness.
I remember that when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana had started and the bank workers had taken the burden on their shoulders and the work that was not done in 70 years had been done.
Today, he has once again accepted that challenge and I am confident that the resolutions of the 125 crore Indians, the collective mankind of all will give this nation a new strength.
But bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not have that bad habit.
Some people still feel that this money of corruption, this black money, this uncertain money, anonymous money and some others should be brought back to the system.
They are looking for illegal ways to save their money.
The sadness is that they have chosen the path of using the poor.
They are trying to save the money by filling the money in their accounts by illustrating the poor.
I would like to tell such people today, whether to improve or not, whether it is our will or not to comply with the law or not, whether it is our will or not.
But you should not play with the lives of the poor.
And the government does not want our countrymen to be in trouble.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, J. Hadra, Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have shut down the notes of five hundred and thousand.
I would like to bring many such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the people that people welcomed this very hard step for nation's development despite being unsuccessful.
Because we used to say that good days will come, but nobody felt that we would take such a big step.
Seeing all these notes of five hundred and thousand, black money and corrupt people have got a good deal.
There will never be a better day for every Indian.
I am so happy that I feel so proud that the common man of my country has a unique potential.
When people go there, eat and go there after 2-4-6 days, they give money.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
During the elections, I had launched the 'Chai Pe Church' initiative and the whole world had reached this thing.
But I don't know that the weddings are added to Chai Pe Church.
In Gujarat, a girl in Surat gave her tea only to the people who had come to his wedding.
Once I saw the news on television, when I came late at night, I saw that there is a small village named Dhekiajuli in Assam.
What did they say when they got a note of Rs. 2000
Four neighbouring women came together and they went to the market and bought them together and used a note of Rs. 2000.
See how the lives of the village are also changing.
Some people benefited from this mission immediately.
I got the information about the small towns.
It has been reported from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of this note, the old people who were left here did not pay the money.
We are aware of the fact that the poor people don't pay the money for taxes, water strips and electricity bills just two days ago.
Those who are big people, who are familiar with them, who knew that no one would ever ask them, they would not pay the money and they would be very tired.
Each municipality gets 50 of the tax deposits.
However, due to the decision of the 8th, all of them were running to deposit their old notes.
Last year, about Rs. 3,500 crore tax was deposited in 47 urban sectors.
You will be surprised to hear and enjoy them. 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in this week.
But today I congratulate the farmers of my country.
I have recently been taking stock of crop production in this season.
Farmers have found ways even after difficulty.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small traders of our country send jobs and help in enhancing economic conditions.
Just like a big mall in the previous budget, even small shopkeepers of the village can do their business for 24 hours, I believe that the big malls are available for 24 hours and why not the poor of the village
Under the Mudra Yojana, initiatives have been taken to give them loans.
But due to this decision, it is also natural for them to face problems.
I would like to tell our younger brothers and sisters that there is a chance to enter the digital world.
You also download the bank's app on your mobile phone, you also keep the POS machine for credit cards.
Learn how trade can be done without using notes.
You can see that the way we enhance our business through big malls and technologies, a small businessman can enhance our business through a common Young Friendly Technology.
There is no possibility of getting worse, there is no possibility of increasing.
I invite you that we can contribute to the creation of cashless society.
The roads of technology are safe, are confident and are faster.
I am confident that I would like to tell the hardworking brothers and sisters that we have suffered a lot of exploitation.
But Friends, You are my best soldiers.
We have a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and have got the opportunity to take the country to the economic heights.
This world is not as old as we have experience.
We don't know what was happening to the previous generation.
We know how online banking and online ticket booking are done.
There is nothing special in it.
But today, the country wants to do great things, the dreams and the cashless society, it is true that we will not succeed but we have not started it.
If we start the Cashless Society then the goal is not far away.
Wallet means e-packet.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
However, after 8th, the poor also started using RuPay cards and the use of it has increased by about 300.
Like Pripeed Cards are available for mobile phones and Pripeed Cards are available to spend money in the bank account.
This work is so simple that the way we send votes.
I am sure that a very uneducated person knows how to forward Suddha Votsop.
Not only this, technology is getting so simple that for this purpose there is no need for smart phones.
Whether it is a dhobi or a vegetable seller or a milk seller or a present letter or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have insisted on simplifying this system.
All the banks are working on this.
And now you have read in the present letter in the last two-four days when you have withdrawn the amount of authority using such a card.
The technologies that we need to spend online will be in our mobile phones.
Moreover, after taking half an hour or two hours every day, we should tell at least ten families that how technology is being used and how can we download our bank apps
We have to lead this campaign to free the country from corruption, to free the people from black money, to get rid of problems and problems.
I believe that if the common man learns this system, he might get rid of the thoughts of work and if all the youth of India humble themselves in this work then it would not take a long time.
Within a month, we can stand as a modern Indian in the world.
And you can do this thing through a mobile phone and you can go to ten households every day.
I invite you not only to stop with support but also to be the army of change and make changes.
We will take this fight forward to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters of the country have transformed their lives from the youth.
Kenya has set up a mobile system M-PESA, which has used technology and named M-PESA.
This country has brought a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work individually in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSSs.
Amitabhji, the most popular artist of this century, has taken the cleanliness mission forward.
It seems that cleanliness is inspired in their nerves and that is why on the birth anniversary of our fathers, they will remember the work of cleanliness.
He writes a poem of Harivansh Rai ji, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of the soils, the life of fun, my introduction - Harivansh Rai dynasty.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you on the Narendra Modi App through Mann Ki Baat, through your thoughts, emotions, letters and letters.
Mann Ki Baat programme spreads at 11 o'clock but we will soon get to hear it from regional languages.
Deepawali is celebrated in every corner of India with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
Festival is the second name of the lives of Indians, whoever sees it from afar and it is natural.
Since the Vedas, the tradition of festivals in India has changed from time to time.
However, in all these journeys, one thing is reflected that the entire journey of festivals in India, its expansion, its intensity and its impact on the masses, has been linked to Swayam La Samashti.
The main objective of this is to expand the personality and personality, extend the perimeter of our limited ideas from society to universe and achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have incorporated all these things in a scientific manner in the festivals that include food in the festivals that are being celebrated in India.
Today the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of care.
The tradition of the festival of India is merely enhancing love for nature, giving respect to everyone from small children to the elders.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate the festival of responsibilities for everyone.
Halli takes a holiday on Sunday, but the old generation labourers, Koli Bandhan used to take a holiday on the day of Amavasya and Poornima.
This darkness is not the darkness of light but it is also the darkness of darkness.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it is an endeavour to light light the light of evil blindness in the society, to remove the blindness of individuals and to bring the light of positivity to the end of Deepawali.
The poor people have a pottery of soil, but they seem to be clean and shiny during the days of Deepawali.
In this context, Diwali is a cleanliness mission.
However, not only the house but the cleanliness of the entire area, the cleanliness of the streets and the cleanliness of the entire village is the need of the hour.
In this context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the limits of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments from all over the world want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
You may be aware that the US postal service released a postage stamp on Diwali this year.
Canada's Prime Minister also shared his photographs on Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organized a grand event to gather all the societies on the occasion of Diwali in London and also participated in it.
There is no such city in Britain that Deepawali is not being celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the picture that Singapore's Prime Minister has put on Instagram and shared with the whole world with pride
16 women Parliamentarians from Singapore are standing outside the Parliament.
He said the Prime Minister of New ealand had recently come here and we have to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
On this occasion, I would like to say that this festival of light of Deepawali is a festival of inspiration that brings the global community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Deepavali along with new clothes and various tasty food items are played with great interest .
Young children and youngsters like to bury them.
Children sometimes don't want to be enthusiastic, sometimes they get rid of it, sometimes they invite them to the big crisis by trying to make a big voice at the same time.
Is there a possibility of setting fire around us
During the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, fire news and news of death are a matter of concern.
On the day of Diwali, many doctors are busy celebrating Diwali with their families.
The festival of Diwali goes on for a long time in our country.
While celebrating the festival of Deepawali, we also prepare for Chhath Puja.
In the eastern part of India, the festival of Chhath Puja is a big festival.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
It is difficult to demonstrate what the Sun God gives us, what we get from the direct and indirect Sun God.
Chhath Puja is a festival of the worship of Sun .
People in the world worship the rising sun.
But Chhath Puja is such a festival in which Moving Surya is also worshipped.
It also provides a massive social message.
In my future, it is always a sense of gratitude for the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces and in the same spirit I felt that this year's Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I have invited the countrymen to send a message to Solzers for this campaign.
Today, I would like to bow down to the people who do not have a feeling of immense love, pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
The way this spirit has been expressed, every citizen has recognised a different power.
Through the message of all of you, our security forces have got new patience and new strengths.
Be it schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons and actors, all of them have expressed their feelings.
Media has given this Deepotsav as an opportunity to express gratitude to the army.
Today we celebrate Diwali while someone is standing in the desert desert, someone is on the peaks of the Himalayas, someone is protecting the industries, someone is watching the safety of the airport, all these soldiers are carrying out innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine how pride it will be for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Solzers has shown innumerable emotions on the Hashtag.
Ashwini Kumar Chouhan has sent a poem and I feel like reading and showing it.
I speak Shivani Mohan.
The message to Solzers, which we have launched on this occasion of Diwali, is encouraging our army brethren.
My father and mother-in-law were also officers in the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are several officers in the Army Circle on the border of the country who are getting a good message and they are getting a big boost.
I would like to say that along with the officers and soldiers of the army, their entire family and their wife also make a great sacrifice.
Through your messages, the entire army community is getting a good message and I would like to convey my best wishes to you too.
Whether it is natural calamities, the problems arising out of law and order, whether it has to do two hands with the enemies or the courageous actions of bringing the youth back in the wrong way, our soldiers continue to be motivated and motivated on every frontier of life.
I also want to tell you about an incident and I want to tell you what can inspire to achieve success.
One of our ITBP personnel in the security forces is Vikas Thakur, a resident of a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The name of his village is Bandha.
Our ITBP personnel had gone to our village on holidays.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has become a really open defecation free state.
Very few people go to those villages.
The engineering students of the city are reflected at a distance from the village where there is no toilet.
NCC umbrella, NSS members and engineering students decided to build toilets in this village.
All the luggage, bricks, cements and other important things that are required to build toilets have been taken to the village by paving their shoulders all day long.
These youngsters have demonstrated the open defecation of a small village in the remote areas of the jungle.
That is why Kerala will soon become an open defecation free state.
Gujarat has announced that more than 150 places are open defecation free.
10 districts have been opened defecation free.
Haryana will celebrate its Golden Festival on 1st November and has decided to make its state open defecation free in a few months.
So far, seven districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I congratulate the people of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for their contribution in removing the blindness of the country in the form of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and the first scheme has to be stopped after the first scheme.
However, it is usually not very important for anyone to take care of these things.
Old schemes are going on, new schemes are going on, the future schemes are being waited and the same continues.
Our country does not need kerosene in those households where gas is used for cooking.
He has taken a big decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon get kerosene free from the way they have taken this task.
Only the mediators and the parties will be able to get rid of this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhiji has remained a guide for all of you.
The need of the hour is to pay attention to the ambitions that have been created in the minds of the poor.
We have to take one step together to get out of the crisis.
Whatever our old thinking is, the discrimination between the sons and the daughters in the society should be eliminated.
In schools, Suddha is now an independent resource house for children and girls.
This is the opportunity for our daughters to experience a discriminatory India.
It is not right that there should be darkness spread in the village after the 21st century has been destroyed.
The mission to provide electricity to such villages at the earliest, is being successfully implemented.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke-free lives to five crore families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers and those who run a bath shop were stuck in the evil cycle of feeding interest.
Several people have got rid of this ill wheel of interest through Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts.
Direct deposits are made in banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the real beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to free the lives of the common man from the mediators and the parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great man of this country who has dedicated his life to the integration of India.
You will be sure that Sardar Patel's birth anniversary is on 31st.
Sardar Patel enjoyed his entire life to connect the country and made it a success in his mission and brought everyone together.
At the same time, Durdev said that on the same day Indira Gandhiji was killed.
We all know the incidents that took place in the country after their deaths.
Sir, I want to think of what can be done to prevent such an accident
My dear countrymen, this is not the sadness of just one person.
It is a testimony to the history that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the great work of the Bhagirath efforts to unite the country after Chanak.
This injustice on Sardar ji's birth anniversary is the birth anniversary of those great men who lived for unity. This black leaf of history is painful for all of us.
However, we have to go ahead with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is a variety of languages, a variety of species, a variety of dresses, a variety of diversity, the unity of diversity is the strength of India, the speciality of India is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to explore and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the ideas and tendencies that spread surpassion.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb a Shreshtha Bharat.
The foundation of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Seeing the struggle of farmers, the life of Sardar Saheb started.
But Sardar Saheb took the initiative not only for struggle but also for creative work.
I pay my respectful tributes to Sardar Saheb and urge you to make a pledge of unity and remember them wherever you are on this unity day on 31st October.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings are guided not only for the entire humanity but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev, the message of service, truth and Sarbat da Bhala.
Peace, unity and goodwill were their fundamentals.
The mission to free society from discrimination, superstition and evils was launched from every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev.
Guru Nanak Dev had chosen Bhai Lalo as his companion when he had reached the peak of the untouchable, ethnic, ethnic practice, high and lower disorders.
Let us move ahead with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' that inspires us to give light to knowledge and to quit discrimination like Suddha Guru Nanak Devji.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
I wish you all the best wishes to fulfill your dreams and resolutions and spend your lives in happiness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all.
In the recent terrorist attack in Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir, we have lost eighteen brave soldiers of our country.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our army.
And they will make efforts to ensure that the 125 crore people of the country are able to live with happiness.
But the army does not speak.
Today, I would like to speak specially to the people of Kashmir.
Now the people of Kashmir are familiar with the anti-national forces.
And as the truth has come to know of them, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Every parents feel that schools and colleges should be resumed at the earliest.
Farmers feel that the goods and fruits that are produced in the farm should go to the markets of India.
It seems that economic activity should be smooth.
And for the past few days, this behavior has started to be smooth.
We have to achieve new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem together, find ways and guide the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
Government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know the violence through social media.
It gives an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings of every kind of people in every part of India and it strengthens democracy.
Harsh Vardhan, a young man who learned in the eleventh year, recently presented a different idea to me.
Then I resolved that I would study for more than three hours every day.
I would like to make the country useful.
Harsh Vardhan Bhai, I am glad that when you are disturbed in the environment, you can think it with a calm mind at such a young age.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the irritation in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge price.
It is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
It shows the determination to do something.
Everyone feels like doing something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this emotional world of the country in a very good way.
And Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan had inspired the common man of the country to work for the country.
There is another way of expressing patriotism in the voices of bombs and guns, which has been shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
Karthik has written on the Narendra Modi App that his throne for the Paralympics Competition has created history and his sports shown is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan has written on the Narendra Modi App that we should mention that our throat has done a very good job in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only are we both, but every person in the country has been associated with our sportspersons in Paralympics with an emotional ethos.
Beyond sports, this paralysis and the performance of our sportspersons have brought about a complete change in the vision of humanity and towards Divyangs.
And I cannot forget what our victorious sister Deepa Malik Hin said.
When he won the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a great strength in this twist.
At this time 19 athletes had participated with three women of our country in the Paralympics competition .
In comparison to other sports, when Divyang plays, physical capabilities, sports capabilities are more important than that.
You will be surprised to hear that our sportspersons have won four medals, two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the second gold medal at Bhalafaki.
And when he was born, he had to lose a hand due to a shock of electricity.
Just think that the person who wins the first gold medal at the age of thirty-five years and won the second gold medal at the thirty-fiveth year, how much would he have done in his life
Mariyappan Thangvelu won the gold medal in the High Orissa.
He does not live in any big city or even in the middle class rich house.
In the twenty-first year of age, despite physical difficulties, he won the medal for the country.
Thalit Deepa Malik has done wonderful to hoist the Vijay Flag.
Varun C.
Bhati won the Bronze medal in Udi.
Very few people would be aware of what paralysis has been done by these Divyangjans at this time.
Not only this, I was surprised that when I realized that the fourth medal for the Divyang sportspersons would not get the medal, but he completed the race in less time than the gold medal for the Sabal sportspersons.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and India is moving forward in the direction of formulating a smooth plan for the development of Paralympics in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a great emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibira for persons with disabilities and several world records were recorded at that time.
Gauri Shardul and it came from the inaccessible jungles of Nang district and the entire Ramayana is poetry-oriented.
And when I heard the people gathered there, the people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to dedicate a book to the people of Divyangjan and collected the success story of persons with disabilities.
This experiment was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record .
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen to have three world revolutions from persons with disabilities on one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on the same day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit, every citizen should have this duty, a climate of humiliation should be created for cleanliness.
When two years are completed on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 125 crore Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we all can tell that everybody has tried to move one pound ahead.
And that is why everybody, whether it is ordinary citizen or government office or road, bus station or railway station, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, small children or senior citizens, rural poor, farmer women, everybody is contributing to cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
I want you to move forward.
And that is why if we want to talk about rural India then till now about two crore and fifty lakh toilets have been built.
In the states, in the districts, in the villages and in the villages, a competitive competition has been started.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve full success in the Open Defecation Free Gram Abhiyan.
Congratulations to those who have worked, and those who are trying for this.
And I would urge the countrymen that for the honour of mothers and sisters, we have to free the country from this problem for the health of children.
Let us move ahead with this resolution.
I would like to present a scheme for my young friends, especially those who use plenty of violence technology.
By phone calling this number of 1969, we will not only be able to know the condition of building toilets in our city but also ask for toilets.
We have to take advantage of this, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate sector to come forward.
He sponsored young professionals who wish to work for cleanliness.
He can be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Fertilizer manufacturers have been told that the fertilizers that will be produced from waste should be purchased.
The farmers who do organic farming have been told to provide those fertilizers.
It has been said that those who want to improve the health of their land, those who take care of the health of the earth, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers, they should provide these fertilizers as required.
And Shri Amitabh Bachchan Ji is contributing to this work as a congratulations ambassador.
I invite the youngsters to start new startups in the field of waste to wealth and wealth, to develop machinery, to develop technology.
It is definitely a job to do this.
The India Sanitation Conference is being organised in a special event from 25th September to 3rd October this year.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers, Mayors of the metropolitan cities will meet together and discuss deeper discussions on cleanliness and sanitation.
What can be technology
What could be the economic policy
How can we get public participation
How can it create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new news about cleanliness is continuously coming.
Recently, I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University went to one hundred and seven villages and started awareness campaigns on toilet construction.
He worked hard and contributed to the construction of nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, you must have seen that under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramvir Singh, a group of Ganga swim from Devprayag to Gangasagar, 2800 km away and gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidelines.
Each department focuses on cleanliness for fifteen days.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayats, Department of Rural Development will come together to formulate a roadmap for Swachhta in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and the Ministry of Consumer Welfare will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan in the areas related to them in the last two weeks of October 16-31.
I urge the citizens to join the department with which we are associated with it.
You must have seen that a survey on hygiene is being conducted.
Earlier, in 73 cities, the situation of cleanliness was presented to the people of the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind in this regard and now we can do something better.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope all of you will contribute to this.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri is celebrated.
I urge you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I also want to tell you that in our family there should be only one thing of khadi so that Diwali can be implemented in the house of the poor.
Would you like to join the Swachhta Abhiyan as a citizen on 2nd October
Two hours, four hours, we should participate in the work of cleanliness and I will tell you to share one photo of it, one photo of it and one photo of it on the Narendra Modi App.
Share video if there is a video.
Look, with your efforts, this campaign will get a new strength and a new momentum across the country.
Recalling Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving it in life is different and no one can record it or not.
And the response that he received can be said to be a great inspirational event in the national life of India.
Several youngsters, small institutions, people in the corporate sector, students and voluntary organizations of our country will celebrate the joy of guiving sales in many cities of the country from 2nd October to 8th October.
Its mission is to bring food items and clothes together to the needy people.
It was a joy to see that sports on the face of those poor children.
I want to assist the youngsters in the cities where this joy of guiving is going to be celebrated.
My dear countrymen, today, 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and today his birth centenary is starting.
He worked to interpret the political ideals that millions of workers like me are working with political ideas.
He spoke of India's rooted politics and gave a visionary support to India's cultural tradition.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay is being started today.
This is the principle of Antyodaya.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke about the interests of every person in the grassroots.
How will the fruits of development reach the poorest of the poor
He presented the entire economic framework in two words, work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Vijayadashmi, I started the Mann Ki Baat two years ago.
I thank all the listeners for the kind of blessings and appreciation you have given you during the completion of two years.
I am also grateful to AIR because Mann Ki Baat has not only spread but also worked hard to reach the listeners through all regional languages.
I would like to thank the listeners who had written a letter after the Mann Ki Baat, who had laid down the doors of the government, who had shown the errors in the work of the government and I would like to thank them for taking into account such letters, by summoning the government officials and providing a platform to solve the problems of the people.
That is why Mann Ki Baat is not just a fifteen-twenty-minute dialogue, it has become an opportunity for social change.
Anybody can have a greater joy than that.
How will it be a festival connecting human beings
And that power will become a means of real power and then we all come together to celebrate the festival of victory.
Let us do this power, let us go with the mantra of unity.
Let us celebrate Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity, harmony to take the nation to a new height, celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
English rendering of the text of PMs Mann Ki Baat from All India Radio
My dear countrymen, On 29th August, Hockey's magician Dhyan Chand's birth anniversary.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remember his contribution on this occasion.
In 1928, 1932, 1936, he played an important role in winning India's Hockey Gold in the Olympics Games.
You all cricket lovers know the name of Bradman.
My countrymen, as the time of Mann Ki Baat starts coming closer, the information starts coming on my gov or Narendra Modi App.
Besides cricket, Indians have so much awareness and awareness about other sports.
This message has become a source of inspiration for me.
Sachin says, In the Mann Ki Baat of this time, talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
The medals you got were won by the girls.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anyone.
One of these girls is from North India, one from South India, some from East India and some from another part of India.
That is why it seems as if these daughters of the entire country have brightened the name of India.
My Gowwar peak Thakur writes that we have been able to do better in Olympics.
He said, Congratulations to Honble Modi Sir on winning two medals in Rio first
But I would like to take care of this thing, was it really good for us
And the answer is, no
We need to make long strides in the sports sector.
Our parents are focusing on studying today.
The society also believes that sports is a fool of time .
We cannot ignore that we have not been able to perform according to our expectations.
In some cases it has happened that the sportspersons who were performing well in India, did not show the performance in the sports and got only two medals in medal tables.
One more thing is true that if you do not get medals, you will know that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have shown some good duty in many sports.
Look at the same time, his innovative Bindra ji stayed at fourth place in Nambaji and won the medal at a very short distance.
The same thing happened in Tennis, Sunia Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
For the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar was eligible for the last round of the track field...
You will definitely be happy to see that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached the Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the hockey team of men has succeeded in reaching the Nock Out Ferry.
Our team is strong and it is part of the rivalry that whoever won the gold medal, who lost the same face in the entire competition, who defeated them
The performance of some sportspersons was good, for example, Aditya Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das...
My countrymen, we have to do a lot but if we have to do something so far then we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
This committee of the Government of India will study intensely and will study what is done in sports worldwide.
The Planning Committee will formulate what we can do and what we can do.
We have to make a visionary plan by 2020, 2024, 2028.
I also urge the State Governments to set up such a committee and think of what we can do in the field of sports, what can we do in the field of sports, what one state can do, states should like one or two sports and how much we can show in that sports.
We will make all the preparations and I am confident that we will get the best position in the sports world with 65 of the country's youth population.
We have to move ahead with this resolution.
Friends, September 5 Teachers Day
For some years, on the occasion of Teachers Day, I have been giving time with the students and I was spending time as a student among them.
I was also learning a lot from these students.
September 5 was Teachers Day for me and Education Day too.
That's why there is a thought in mind that we should express my feelings in the Mann Ki Baat about it.
The place where Mother is in life is also the place of teachers.
I have also seen such teachers that even those who are more concerned about our people than themselves.
They live their lives for their disciples, students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, there is a discussion of Pullela Gopichand.
They are sportspersons, but they have presented the example of how excellent teachers are.
The contribution of teachers to the lives of all of us is always felt.
On 5th September, the former President of India, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, on his birth anniversary and the whole country considers this day as Teachers' Day.
Even if he reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the role of a teacher himself.
I write in such a beautiful handloom and my own letters are very bad.
And that's why someone's good signatures have been seen that my heart gets respected.
If you have a photo with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if you remember it, if you are inspiring, then you must share it.
Remember, it will be valuable for you to see the contribution of teachers from the point of view of students.
Friends, Ganesh festival will come in a few days.
We all feel that our country, our society, our family, every individual, their lives should be irregular.
When we think of Ganeshotsav then it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of the public Ganeshotsav is the gift of Lokmanya Tilaks.
The creation of programmes should be such that the society gets new inspiration and freshness, and the self-reliance given by them is my right to be born and I will be able to achieve that.
Today, Ganesh Festival was started not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Public issues are discussed, essay competitions, sequence competitions are organized.
It touches social subjects through artistic tactics.
This is the inspirational mantra that the campaign for a kind of public education is going on through the Ganesh Festival. Lokmanya Tilak has given us the right to be my birth.
Whether we cannot give us the message of the mantra that the Suraj is our right, let us move towards the Suraj and the Suraj is our priority
I am inviting you.
It is true that the festival is the power of the society.
Festival brings new consciousness to the individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change as the demand of time.
This time I have noticed that some people have written a lot on Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja and they are worried about the environment.
The statues made from POP are not environment friendly.
Others have also spoken about this pain intensely.
I pray to all of you to use the idols of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Durga as in ancient times and not follow our old traditions.
The protection of environment, the protection of our river lake, the protection of small animals from pollution is God's service in a way.
I do not know what kind of feeling we will take these issues, but I do not say this alone but it is the opinion of many people.
In some opinions, the artist of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfle, the institution of Kolhapur, Nature Friend, Science Probodhi.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durgapuja has a lot of time .
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be awarded the title of Saint on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
Mother Teresa, who has served the poor people of India for a lifetime, gets a saint degree, it is natural for all Indians to be proud.
The event will be held on 4th September, in which a delegation of officers led by the Government of India and the Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj will be held on behalf of 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a big change.
Jan Shakti is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has successfully tried to bring people together for the cleanliness of clean Ganga and Ganga in collaboration with five State Governments.
On 20th of this month, the village heads of the Ganga coast were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all these chiefs - some of them from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and others from Jharkhand and West Bengal for coming to Allahabad for this resolution.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision.
I congratulate the Chief Ministers of all those five states that they have taken a certain step in the cleanliness drive of the Ganga by bringing the people's power together.
Some people have written from English and some have written from Hindi and some have written from Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their homes.
He called for toilets.
Some children have written that this year my birthday will not be celebrated but definitely make toilets.
This work was done by these children of seven to seventy-seven years.
It had such an impression that on the second day when we went to school, parents wrote letters to the teachers and assured them that we will make toilets in the house for a date.
Congratulations to those who have made this idea, congratulations to those students who have tried for it and special congratulations to the parents that they decided to work on making the toilets in their minds seriously.
A 16-year-old daughter of this district, Mallama, has called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the features of this village chief Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and made toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have this resolution.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody has been connected in that form, everybody is contributing to something or the other.
Everyday news comes - what is the effort of anyone
The Government of India called upon the people to make a film on cleanliness for two-three minutes and send it to the Government of India.
I would like to tell the TV channels that you also have such competitions.
The idea of innovation can also strengthen the cleanliness mission.
Friends, I have always been inviting you to invite you to have a cordial relationship with the neighbouring countries.
However, this is not a channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are connected to the same cultural tradition today.
They will interact with each other and exchange ideas and will enjoy the joyment of the Bangladeshi people from both sides.
All India Radio has contributed to peoples contact.
The President inaugurated the Channel.
I thank Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I extend my best wishes to all AIR friends that they are contributing to foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the smoke of the Prime Minister's post but finally I am a man like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me too much.
Some of these emotional events give new powers, inspire them and I also inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
A 84-year-old mother-G Pensioner is a teacher - he wrote to me a letter.
I feel like not declaring my name, even if I have said it, I feel like telling them their names.
In a letter, he said that we called for abandoning gas subsidy and then left the subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago, one of us came and gave a letter and thanked me for giving it up.
This letter of Prime Ministers of India is not less than Padmashree for me.
Friends, I have tried to give a letter to those who left the subsidy on cooking gas and somebody will give it to my representatives.
I have been trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing a good job and your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke of the smoke and I am a retired teacher and my age will be new in a few years.
I am sending a payment of Rs. 50 thousand so that the poor mothers can get rid of the smoke of stole.
You know that a mother who absorbs the pension of a common teacher, who gives 50 thousand rupees to the poor mothers for gas connections, the question is not about 50 thousand rupees.
The question is about the spirit of that mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which strengthens the confidence of my country's future.
He did not write this letter to me as the Prime Minister, but wrote a simple letter - Modi brothers
Flood situation has occurred in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local institutions, the social institutions and the citizens have done as much help as possible.
In August 2016, all these political parties, including political opposition parties, did not provide a single chance against each other, passed the GST Bill.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and if all the parties move together then it would have been such a big job.
In the same way, all the political parties of the country have collectively raised a single issue in relation to the situation that happened in Kashmir.
Those people who try to create such a situation in front of these small children, they will have to answer it sometimes to the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is engraved in diversity.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, the government is responsible for all of us to strengthen the unity and only then will the future of the country be brightened.
I have full faith in the power of 125 crore people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the entire country will be colored with enthusiasm and zeal.
You all know that in a few days the world will have a big sports event.
The name of Rio is going to be repeated in our ears.
Your hopes will be very much, but the work of reinforcing the confidence of those sportspersons who have gone to play in Rio is about 125 crore people of the country.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever you are in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard penance.
Conquests and defeats are important, but at the same time it is more important to reach the sports and that is why all of us will be greetings and best wishes to all the sportspersons who have gone for the Rio Olympics.
Today, I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover, a student of Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, has sent a poem.
Many of you may have poets, who have written poems, may have written poems, some people will make those voices in every language, but the poems that Suraj has sent me are sharing with you.
Ankit has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam Ji.
The whole country and the world paid homage to him, but when the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, the words of science, technology, missiles come to light and that is why Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
Ankeet ji is right to say
And if we have to go with it or go beyond it, then we should do research and innovation and both these are the souls of technology.
If there is no research, innovation, then the way the accumulated water produces stink, technology also remains a burden.
If we live in the world without innovation and innovation, then we have taken some steps to sweeten the attraction of science, research and innovation for technology in the new generations to become evident in the changing age.
And I tell you that if I tell us to innovate then I mean AIM.
10 lakh rupees will be given to those schools where such tinkering labs will be built and Rs. 10 lakhs will be given to them for five years.
On the other hand, India is facing many problems.
We see problems and difficulties in everyday life.
Now we have to find a technology-based answer.
We have called upon the younger generation of the country through Atal Grand Challenges that if you see problems and problems, then find it through technology, research, innovation and bring it to us.
The Government of India is encouraging you with a special prize for research on problems and problems and technologies and I am happy that people are interested in this thing when we have spoken about the tinkering labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I used to worry about the drought, these days we are enjoying rains and the news of floods is also coming.
The state government and the central government are working with shoulders to help the flood victims.
Everybody's mind gets happy, everybody's mind gets happy despite some difficulties due to rains, because our entire economic surge is the centre of rain and the farming that runs on it.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent for birth .
But if we remain cautious, remain cautious and are striving then the way to escape from it will be easy.
We look at the publicity on VV but sometimes we are slightly sad in the context of action.
The government, the hospital, the doctors will do their jobs, but I urge you to be cautious for not having any illness in water for not entering the dengue in our homes, in our departments, in our family.
Dear countrymen, I would like to take care of one more crisis.
Today, life has become very fast and we do not get time to think about ourselves due to continuous running.
If sick then it feels that heals at the earliest and antibiotics are taken for him.
We don't move through shortcut.
Complete those pills course .
Even after leaving incomplete those bacteria will benefit , even if they take more than required bacteria will be benefitted hence the course of taking pills has been proved in many days .
It is essential to finish it, it has been finished, but it is essential to complete the course.
In medical language he is called antibiotic resistance , how to use antibiotic , follow his rules .
In the last decade, there has been a sudden decline in the mortality rate but even today the lives of pregnant mothers cannot be saved in large numbers.
Deficiency of blood during pregnancy , infections occurring during delivery , high blood pressure , unknowingly some problems end their life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign, its name is Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign on 9th of every month free check-up of pregnant woman will be done at the government health center .
In order to save the lives of both mothers and children, I appealed to women illness experts whether you cannot provide free service to poor mothers on 9th
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not give 12 days of one year to the poor
There are thousands of such doctors, they have written letters to me by accepting my requests and requests.
There are thousands of such doctors who believe in me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed collectively in the country and in the world.
Shukracharya Niti has said: Nasti roots Anushadh - there is no plant in which there is no medicinal properties.
The trees who donate the trees also preserve them in the world like a father.
But in today's generations, there are some people who follow these ideals and bring them into practice.
The disciplines of the Mahabharata have said that the trees also fulfil the responsibility of the child in the world, like Sonal has taken up the idea of fulfilling the wishes of not only our parents but also the entire society.
Khandu Marati Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnar Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra, has married his grandson Sonal in a different inspirational manner.
The temples should start the tradition of planting in good rainy season .
Tree plantation can easily become a mass movement.
I constantly tell the farmer brothers that if we damage the land due to dams on the banks of our farm, can we cultivate timber instead of dams
Today, to make houses in India, to make wooden goods, several crores of rupees have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant a tree of wood, palm, which will be useful for the work of households, can be cut and sold by the permission of the government after fifteen-twenty years, you can get a new source of income and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, a lot of campaigns have been carried out in several states using the environmental climate, the Government of India has recently enacted a CAMPA law and more than Rs. 40,000 crore will go to the states for planting trees.
I was told that on July 1, the Maharashtra government has set up two and a half crore trees in the entire state and has resolved to plant three crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert-Bhoomi have celebrated a big forest festival and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh trees.
25 lakh trees in Rajasthan are not a small thing.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can know how big they have taken up.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase 50 Green by 2029.
Railways have also started this work in the Green India Mission launched by the Central Government.
There is a bright tradition of Suddha Forest Festival in Gujarat .
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Shahid Forest have been undertaken in Gujarat under the One Festival and have started a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone is eligible for commendation.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
Whenever there is a visit to foreign countries, there are discussions about international policy trade, some of the MoUs are going to be held.
But for me the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage in a way.
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence , love , compassion fall on the ears then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela ji come in front of us .
During my visit to South Africa, Financial settlement was known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunity is not such a big mantra for any society and government.
Both the ways of equality and harmony take us to a bright future.
We all expect a good life, a good future of children, everybody's requirements are different, everybody's needs are different, but the roads are the same and that is the same for development, equality, equality, equality, equality and equity.
Let us be proud of these Indians who have shown this basic mantra of life in South Africa from our world.
He told me about an incident and I am speaking craftsmen from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman had lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide due to false e-mails.
As a woman, I was very sad.
I want to know your ideas about this.
Everyone knows this thing that if you know the fascinating things on your mobile phones and e-mails then there is a charming message that you have got so much money, you can pay so much money and take so much money.
Some people are enthusiastic and some are entangled with greed.
These technologies are spreading across the world.
We are sometimes fascinated.
I believe that we should be cautious of this favour, be aware of this favour, if such false news comes, then we should tell them in our friends and groups and make them aware.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet many people during that Parliament session.
Our Parliamentarians bring people from their departments, meet them, tell us about us, tell us their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
It was like seeing the zeal of children and girls that they had brought a big album along with themselves.
Artificial paintings have been painted at the station.
You must go to Aligarh and see this station.
This is an example of this that peoples participation can bring about change.
Thanks to all those who work in this way in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with rainy season there is also a season of festivals in our country.
Festivals are celebrated in temples and pilgrimages.
You are also connected to these festivals outside the house and outside.
Raksha Bandhan is a special festival of our strongness.
Like last year, can we not give Raksha Bandhan a gift to our mothers and sisters as Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Imagine, give such a meeting to the sister that will ensure real security for her life.
Moreover, if there is a woman who makes a meal at home, if there is a woman who cleanses his house, if there is a daughter of poor mother, then we can present this Raksha Bandhan scheme 'Suraksha Bima Yojana' or 'Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana'.
My dear countrymen, many of you are those who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
We can inspire us for 75 years of uit India and 70 years of India's independence, create new zeal and hope, it can be an opportunity for the country to do something.
Freedom festival is not a government programme, it should be for the countrymen.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that you will also do something good that connects with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on 15th August.
You will have a lot of things in your hearts, you will have a desire to understand that things should be utterly distributed from the Red Fort.
If you want to tell me from the Red Fort as your delegate, as your delegate, as your principal servant, then you must send me some suggestions and suggest new ideas.
Let us invite you, let us remember the heroes who sacrificed their lives for freedom, let us remember the great men who lived for India and take a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I got the opportunity to make Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat for me is not a ritual.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that through Mann Ki Baat, I can reach the common man in every corner of India.
I thank All India Radio for the successful efforts made by All India Radio to translate Mann Ki Baat into regional languages at 8 pm.
And I am happy to note that those people who listen to the Mann Ki Baat programmes bring me their feelings through the telephone through the telephone and My Gov through the Narendra Modi App.
I can use your suggested issues to run the government.
How active should governance be for the welfare of the people
How much priority should the work of public welfare be given
Therefore, my interaction with you is very important.
5th June is the World Environment Day.
Environmental issues are discussed all over the world.
On this occasion, the theme of Environment Day is ero Tolerance for Illigal Wildlife Trade, which is completely preventing the trade of wildlife, will not only be discussed but we should also talk about trees and water.
This is the reason why you must have seen that the Himalayas of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir region had recently started to be very humiliated in the jungles near the footsteps.
Therefore, saving forests and saving water is the duty of all of us, it is the responsibility of all of us.
The Chief Ministers of every state discussed about two to two and a half hours.
He listened to what to tell them.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, have utilised technologies.
We need to reach out to other states of the country through NITI Aayog, through these successful measures taken by the State Governments.
Peoples participation becomes the main cause of success in addressing such problems.
And therefore, water storage is equally important.
And that is why drop More Crop - each drop - more production, micro-irrigation, micro-irrigation, less water crops.
It is a matter of joy that sugarcane farmers are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation in many states.
I have also come to know from them that many states have a big goal, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat have done a big job in the field of millet irrigation.
They are trying to bring two or three lakh hectares of land under micro-irrigation every year.
If this mission is being implemented in all the states then agriculture will not only benefit but will also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Bhagirathi mission in Telangana has tried to use the water of the rivers of Godavari and Krishna in a better way.
Efforts are being made to refill ground water with the help of technologies through the Niru Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
People are also providing financial assistance along with Shramdan in the people's movements that have been in Maharashtra.
I am sure that the Jalakshi Shivar Abhiyan will actually be useful to save Maharashtra from future water resources.
The State of Chhattisgarh has undertaken the Public State-Jalsurajya Abhiyan.
A big campaign has been taken to revive the wells of the ancient canals of Rajasthan and Gujarat in the form of a water temple.
However, in some parts of that state there is water conservation.
A big work is being done by building checkhams and small dams.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is a lot of water therefore we remained careless and when the rains are over then how will it go
And water is not limited to the farmers only.
This is the subject related to villages, poor, labourers, farmers, urban, rural, rich and poor.
Therefore, when the rains are coming, water should be our priority and when we celebrate Diwali this year, how much water we saved during the rainy season
You will see that your pleasure will increase manifold.
And this is not just a government, a political leader, but a common man.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India has to be transparent.
Those who have to reach from one end of India to the other side in a similar manner.
To do this we have to change our old habits.
Today, I would like to touch such a topic that if you help me, then we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards a cashless system.
Through electronic technology, we can get money and send money.
There is no fear of stealing your pocket's pocket.
It will be registered on its own.
It would be a bit difficult to use this method at the beginning but after the habit, this system will be easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
On the other hand, Aadhaar numbers have been received and mobile phones are now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-Jam (J.
By synergizing them, we can move forward towards cashless systems and cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given along with Jan Dhan accounts.
In the coming years, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And there has been a small instrument available in the attack, which is P.
Oh.
You can pay others by using Aadhaar number, RuPay cards through this machine.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to provide money through POS
We have taken the second initiative on the bank on mobile.
It will be easier to exchange money through your mobile phones.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
The post offices are also underway to provide bank services.
If we learn to use this system in the behavior, then we will not be able to get the requirement of direct currency, we will not be able to get the money in the pocket.
Behaviour will continue to happen on its own and it will bring transparency.
Unhealthy behavior, two numbers of behavior will stop.
The impact of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I would urge the countrymen to start it.
Once this system has started, we will move forward in a simple manner.
Whether someone felt twenty years ago that so many mobile phones would be in our hands.
Gradually it became a habit now it is not possible to stay without it .
It is possible that cashless society will be shaped slowly.
But it will be better if it comes in a short span of time.
We must encourage our sportspersons participating in the Rio Olympics and increase their confidence.
He was the candidate for the post of Chief Minister.
But he was also the minister of the Government of India at the same time.
Do they get nutritious food according to the requirement
Whether they should be trainers for their physical health or not .
I am glad to see that the results of the elections will take place, the possibility of taking new responsibility as the Chief Minister, one of my colleagues is also aware of your work as a sports minister.
When the 125 crore Indians are standing with us, our sportspersons feel that it becomes a big force and reinforces their confidence.
In the past, I had taken the topic of the FIFA Under Seventin World Cup.
I have received information from all over the country and I can see that the atmosphere of football is being created across the country.
Many are taking initiatives and making our teams.
I have received several information about the Narendra Modi App.
It is possible that many of them would not play, but thousands of lakhs of youngsters of the country had a pleasant experience of sports.
We are familiar with the relationship between Cricket and India but I have seen so much faith in football
Everything should not be counted on the scales of victory and defeat.
With sportspersonship, India has to create its identity in the world.
I urge the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of excitement for our colleagues associated with sports.
New results are coming from somewhere in the last eight-ten days.
I am not talking about the results of the election, I speak about the students who have studied the net throughout the year.
It is now clear that the results of the tenth and twelfth have started coming together and our daughters are singing valour.
It's a matter of joy.
We have to move forward with confidence.
But I have faced a new kind of question and I have never thought about it.
I felt very fond of reading this.
He says that when I went home after getting 89. 33 percent mark, I felt that I would be commended all around, I would be commended, I would be commended, but as soon as I was there, the households told me that if I had got four times more then it would have been 90 percent.
But I feel buried in my mind.
I have read your letter with pride, I feel that this pain can be of millions and millions of students like you, not of your own.
Because the atmosphere has become such that the errors would be discovered rather than enjoyment in what they got.
This is the second form of negative attitude.
I would like to urge the parents and the parents to enjoy the results that your children will bring.
Otherwise, it will be a day that you will get 100 per cent of the qualities and yet anyone will say that it is true that you have got 100 per cent qualities but if you have done immortality then it would have been better.
Therefore, every thing must have a limit.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur has also written a letter of similar meaning.
He says that the people close to him are not ready to accept their results.
They say that something else would have been done well, something else would have been done well.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not let yourself balance.
Everyone expresses hope and listen.
Stay on your determination and try to do something better.
But if you do not agree to what has been achieved then you will never be able to build new architectures.
And that is why I would urge you to sing the song of the success that has been achieved.
Those who do not get good quality in the exams goes ahead in sports, goes ahead in the field of music, goes ahead in the region of art and business.
God has given everyone some skills.
Just recognise your internal capabilities, focus on it, you will make progress in your life.
There was a time when Santoor Wadya was an integral part of the folk song in the Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivkumar, who took the instrument into his hand and today became an important instrument in the world music.
Sanai - In the Indian Music sector, the instrument was limited to the instrument.
During the time of kings and kings there was a place of Sanai near the entrance of the court .
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this word in hand and took it to Sanai at this height of the world's best musician.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I remember that the cost of medicines in the poor families of our country is going to slide the financial surplus of that family.
And it is true that the cost of not falling sick is very less but after getting sick it becomes like a health first but it costs a lot.
Why should we not have our lifestyle that we will not be sick, we will not have any financial burden on our families.
One is, cleanliness is the most important way to avoid diseases.
If anyone can do the biggest service of the poor then it is cleanliness.
And the second is that Yoga is the subject for which I constantly urge.
Some people call it yoga.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
The whole world has an attraction, faith and the world has accepted it.
This is an invaluable gift given by our ancestors to you, which we have given to the world.
The stressed world gets the strength of living a balanced life.
It is easier for the people associated with Yoga to stay healthy, to be balanced, to create a strong will, to concentrate in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes the collective environment can change the life of a person.
I hope that on June 21, we will definitely do something in this regard.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment also changes.
Can we use Yoga in our lives on 21st June
Can we do yoga in our social life for this
I urge you not to stay behind.
It is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, I had given you a mobile number and we could listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call.
But now it has been made easier.
Whenever we want Mann Ki Baat by giving Missed Col to this number, we will be able to hear in that language.
Namaste.
We decide to do many things during the holidays.
And during these vacations there is a season of mango, it feels like enjoying mango and enjoying the taste of mango.
But this time hard heat has enjoyed it all around.
It is natural to have a climate of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is frequent dryness in it, water storage stops.
Sometimes due to invasion, sometimes due to narrow roads, due to obstacles, water storage in the reservoir becomes less than capacity.
And due to this happening for years, water storage capacity decreases.
However, I have seen that citizens also make very good efforts for this.
In many villages there is awareness about this and the real price of water is known only those who have faced the crisis of hydrobiscus.
And there is sensitivity about water conservation and there is activity to do something about it.
Just a few days ago, I was told that the Hivare Bazar Gram Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the villagers of the state have taken up the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided that such crops which have more water, whether it is wheat or bananas, should not be rubbed by such crops.
It looks very easy to hear but it does not seem that easy.
How could everyone have made such a big resolution together
He took initiatives on Tushar Irrigation, Climate Irrigation, Water Conservation and Water Conservation, and therefore, the village is standing firmly in order to overcome water shortages.
Well, I would like to tell you about this small village of Hiwarebazar but I would like to congratulate all those villages and their best work.
He built nearly twenty-seven farms.
As a result, ground water level has increased, water level has risen.
He said that when the crops needed water, they got water and we got big data.
The income from agriculture has increased by twenty percent.
Water conservation has not only increased but also improves the quality of water.
However, many such initiatives are being implemented by the citizens who never come forward.
The government has launched a good campaign and sometimes it gets fame, but if we look around us then it will be noticed that how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through innovative measures to overcome the drought.
It is a human nature that if there are many difficulties but if there is a good thing then the feeling of all the troubles will be overcome.
There is a possibility of 106 to 110 per cent rainfall during this year's monsoon and it is likely that a message of peace has been received by all.
There is still time for rains but the news has brought a good rain.
Can we take any mission to save water in villages from now on
Farmers need soil and it is useful for crops in the fields.
And if we put the garlands in the village then it will be beneficial for the farming and it will also increase the capacity to collect water in the ground.
There will be water in our wells.
Today, we have a water crisis, there is a situation of drought but the time for the next month and a half is in our hands.
The concern that they feel is social because this work has been going on for nearly thirty years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been implemented.
Ganga gives us a bow and gives us employment and gives us a new strength to live with the Ganges.
As the Ganga flows, it gives a new momentum to the economic activity of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us the Ganges but today crores of Bhagiraths are required to save it.
This campaign will never succeed without public participation.
Several efforts are being made in this regard at the government level.
Efforts are being made to cooperate with the states that are on the banks of the Ganga.
Efforts are being made to participate in social and NGOs.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the water of Ganga.
Everyday the solid waste flows in the utensils and drains of the Ganges.
In order to clean this waste, the work of cleaning the waste on water in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of Trash Scheme.
It has been made available to all local administration institutions and it has been urged to clean the waste by using it.
And recently, I was told that three tons to eleven tons of waste is being evacuated every day where these efforts are being made well.
That is, it is true that such a large amount of dirt has stopped from increasing.
In the coming days, a plan has been made to set up trash schemes at some places and people living on the banks of the Ganges and the Yamuna will soon experience it.
In order to prevent industrial pollution, an action plan has been prepared with paper-leaf industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar factories.
I still feel that it will have a good result.
Absorption of waste materials from the paper factories is now on the way to close.
This is the symptom of this that we are taking steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that if a person from far-flung southern part of the river meets me then he definitely says that the Ganga will be clean or not.
This belief of the common man will succeed in the cleanliness of the Ganga.
Citizens are giving donations to clean the Ganga.
This work is going on in a better way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Diwas in India.
This date was the beginning of Panchayat Raj in our country.
And gradually, the Panchayat Raj system spread across the country is working successfully as an important part of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, I have got the opportunity to visit the place where Dr. Ambedkar was his birthplace, Mahu.
I got the opportunity to salute that holy land and today on 24th, I will celebrate Panchayat Raj Diwas in the state of Jharkhand, where most of our tribal brothers and sisters live in the state.
And at 3 in the afternoon, I interacted with all the Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a big job to create awareness.
How will the democratic institutions be empowered at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
In some villages, food donation initiatives have been taken.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the eternal essence of India-Uday.
Gram Uday is the basis of India-Uday.
Therefore, if we focus on village rise then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure from Mumbai called on her and expressed her concern.
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharma in Gharpura.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
Not being available proper school or college or lack of quality of education .
Even after completing their education, they do not know many basic things, so that their children remain behind in the world.
What are our ideas about this
Today, every family has the biggest dream of parents, that is, education of children.
And I believe that the families in which there is a sense of awareness, the results of this awareness are seen falling on the school.
Every government in our country has stressed on the issue of education and every government has made efforts for it in its own way.
But now the more important is the improvement in our education system.
We have done a big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Standard education from literacy campaign should now be our priority.
Now we have to pay attention to the calculated plans.
How many children have come to school, these priorities have been seen today.
Now we have to focus on providing good education and proper education to the children who have come to school.
You must have seen in the budget of this government and efforts have been made to provide better education.
In this budget, we will see ten Government Universities and ten private Universities getting free from government control and coming at a challenging and competitive level.
What do we want to work for being the best universities and best universities
This scheme has been implemented with the aim of giving them full freedom.
At the same time, education is as important.
For the past few days, citizens have been asking me about one issue.
He writes on the web portal MyGov, some people write on my Narendra Modi App and many youngsters write it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnwal.
Education as well as sports are important for the youth of todays times.
They should have a sense of consciousness, good leadership, so that their holistic development can also be achieved.
I would like to encourage more and more youth and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and Bharat Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to mind that before talking to you, talk to all the members.
And when I asked them when such a meeting was held earlier, they replied that this is the first such meeting of the country since independence.
Therefore, I thank all those young friends and young friends who have urged me in the context of all these works.
A lot of work is being done at your own level, but if our organizations work in a collective manner, then it can have a huge impact.
And now it is true that I was myself a NCC cadet of the NCC.
I got the benefit of this childhood and I believe that such organizations should have a new consciousness.
In this meeting, I shared some issues before him.
He had to talk to them on many things.
We have several young organisations working, what can we innovate in their activities and programmes
If you write this on my Narendra Modi App then I will reach the right place and I feel that after this meeting all these things will get a momentum.
I feel that we will also feel that we will be able to involve it with all of them.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one thing that you will be able to think.
I believe that this is a matter of awakening all of us.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that how many parties would give gas cylinders during the last several elections.
And every political party feels that if the middle class people want to reach through the path of election then gas cylinders are a very important subject.
This is a universal experience.
But it has never been thought out of this square.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to share my shares with you.
I chose a different path and that was the path to trust the people.
Sometimes we have to believe in our people more than the political leaders who believe in themselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, Grants were denied in the form of a right equation.
I would particularly appeal to all the political classes today that we should do at least one thing to believe in people and people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We have to go in this direction.
And I always feel like I have come to mind that why do you get a child for third and fourth class jobs
Believe those who have received the tests and have received the qualities.
Sometimes I also feel that you should announce that no ticket will be checked on this one line of railways.
I believe that it cannot be a rule of government but it can create an atmosphere of trust.
And there is no political leader who creates this environment, it has been prepared by one crore families of the country.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and news channel is difficult.
Is nothing good about us in this country with a population of 125 crore
Please change the situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his deep satisfaction but I feel that this anger is not on me but on the situation of Bhotal.
You will remember our former President Dr.
I have seen Halli that some television channels make positive news a specific time.
The atmosphere of positive news is being created in today's times.
Everyone feels accurate news and good news.
It is true that the greatest person, the best thing, the best words and the best words will be explained in the best manner, the result of this is more positive news than that.
It is true that if we pay more attention to goodness then we will not have much place for bad things.
Blindness will go away, it will happen.
And that is why you might think that the government has started a website called Transforming India.
Not only the government but also the citizens have the philosophy.
And this is a portal on which we can send a good news of yourself.
You can contribute.
Raviji has given a good information but please do not apply to me.
Kumbh is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh fair can become a center of attraction from the point of view of tourism .
Very few people of the world knew that crores of people come on the banks of the river for such a long time.
Festival is celebrated in peaceful and peaceful environment .
In view of organising such events, people are setting new parameters in terms of programme management.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading photographs of Kumbh.
I feel that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism department of the state government and urge people to upload the best photographs.
Not only should there be cleanliness but those who return from there will take a message of cleanliness.
I believe that the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair but we can transform it into a social event.
I am glad to note that the things in our minds have been linked to my heart. Once again I am grateful.
I and you are always waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
At this time, I have seen a lot of letters, responses, phones, there are many things, information and inspiration. Everybody sees something or the other, feels a feeling and there is a lot that I have to include, but there is a limit of time, so that everyone cannot be included.
However, I would like to share your words with you once again in the thread of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that in the last time I had discussed some of the books of Premchand ji and you had decided to share some of the books that we read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But I should acknowledge that I cannot give time to get a book on a large scale.
But there is only one advantage that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books from what you write and send.
However, I feel from the past one month's experience that we should take this initiative forward.
Let us make a corner of books on the Narendra Modi App persistently and when we read a new book, write there, discuss and suggest a good name for the corner of these books.
And I feel that today, the Indians have lost their minds on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made in the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative missions on water conservation.
Be it the government, the NGOs or the battlefields.
The villagers have worked to give a certain direction to a waterfall flowing from the mountains by performing hard work.
And that is also a pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented the loss of soil dust and crops, but also the farmers are getting water.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-East, Meghalaya, is the first state to formulate your water policy.
I congratulate the government of that place.
Farming of such crops is being encouraged and the farmers do not suffer any harm in Haryana.
Many fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
In the fairs, people from every section of the society are serving.
In these fairs, we can give a very effective message of water conservation, perform exhibitions, drama, with festivals, we can reach the message of water conservation in a very simple manner.
In fact, this month, World Children Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
This is a vigorous sports competition in which the youngsters who have survived cancer are the people who have come out with cancer in their lives.
In the event, competitions like Nambaji, Intelligence, Waterways, Running, Football and Table Tennis were organized.
All these ten winners of our country won the medal in this event.
Some of these sportsmen have won more than one medal.
Sanjeev Haripura of Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
Many people from different parts of the country have written to me on Narendra Modi App and My Gauv and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the year 2019, the vision of Space Progress has been very intense for India.
Our scientists had released ASAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was no more discussion on the big and important events like ASAT in the dharma of elections.
With the help of ASAT missile, we have achieved the capability of launching a satellite at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes.
India has become the fourth country in the world to achieve this success and now on July 22, the entire country will be proud of how it has stepped into space from Chandrayaan-2, Sriharikota.
The photographs of the Chandrayaan-II flight filled the countrymen with respect and zeal.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission has many meanings.
Chandrayaan-2 will make our understanding more clear about the moon.
This will help us get more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what I have got to learn from Chandrayaan-2, then I will tell you that these two things are Fath and Fairlessness.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities, believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to hear that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and spirit.
The entire indigenous system is a mission.
This campaign has once again proved that when there is a discussion of innovative enthusiasm and innovation in new areas, our scientists are the best and global standards.
Another important factor is that there is no need to be afraid of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the methods that our scientists have solved all the technical questions in the space of Chandrayaan-2 in record time and night.
This great penance of scientists has seen all the world.
We all should be proud of it and the time to reach Chandrayaan has not changed even after difficulty.
We have to face the temporary setback temporary difficulties in our life, but keep in mind that we have the power to overcome it.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 mission will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting with the authority of the month of September, when lander-victor and rover-prognition will descend on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the youth and the youth of the country to invite the students friends and young partners about a very entertaining competition.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make their participation more entertaining and unforgettable.
I specially urge schools, managers, enthusiastic chief teachers and teachers to make a lot of effort to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the students who have the highest qualification from every state will be taken to Sriharikota by the Government of India and will get the opportunity to witness that moment when the Chandrayaan lands on the surface of the moon in September.
This will be a historic event for the victorious students but for that you will have to participate in the uiz Competition, you will have to get the maximum qualities and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have done an inspection.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given a boost to the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and has always inspired the efforts being made for cleanliness.
The journey that started five years ago is setting up new standards of cleanliness with the participation of many people.
We have achieved the ideal position of cleanliness, not only the roots but the methods that are being achieved in the field of cleanliness from villages to public places are the power of the resolution of 120 crore countrymen but we will not be able to come here.
This campaign is now moving forward from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I used to see the story of Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is an engineer and has left his job in the US and returned to India to serve Mother India.
He took the initiative to make Delhi not only clean but also beautiful just a while ago.
He started with his team from the dustbins of Lodhi Garden.
Beautiful paintings are decorated to many parts of Delhi through street arts.
When he started showing his art from the walls of the Overbridge and the schools to the shrine, people also got help and in a way this silsila started.
You must remember how the paintings of Prayagraj were being decorated during the Kumbh Mela.
I understood that Yogesh Saini and his teams had played a very big role in it.
Though there is no sound of colors and rows, but the message of Indradhanush which is produced by them proves to be more effective than thousand words and we also experience it in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop a culture of waste to wealth in our society.
We have to move forward in the direction of making gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very interesting reaction on my gov.
This was the reaction of Bhai Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, "Mann Ki Baat" programme is good to hear.
I am happy to note that I have played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village in the Community Mobilisation Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Also, there should be an online monitoring of the programme.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which the people directly interacted with the government.
Brothers and sisters, Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the Bank to Village Programme increased and when I got a detailed information about it, I felt that the entire country should know about it.
This programme imagines how much the people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
Literacy, gender quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, basic education, questions of senior citizens were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just the formalities of the government that the officers returned to the village throughout the day, but this time the officers also made a two-day camp in Panchayat and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
Under Khelo India, children had sports competition.
Sports literature, MNREGA Job Card and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe Certificates also appeared there.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that the 'Bank to Village' programme was organised in such far-flung areas where the government officials had to pave the way through the far-reaching roads and climb the mountains sometimes one day and sometimes one-and-a-half days.
The officers also went to the border panchayats where there is constant fear of bullets from across the border and not only did the officers go to the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so heavy that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is very pleasant to have a large number of people participating in these regions and to prepare plans for us.
It is also clear that people are trying to create hatred in the path of development, they are trying to stand hard, they can never succeed in their family purposes.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, the Gyanpeeth Awards, has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he said, 'Bhodige Madige Agyed Lagna, Adrag Bhoomi Magna. That is, the bonds of rain and the streams of water are on fire and the earth is enchanted to see their beauty.
In the entire India, different cultures and speaking people celebrate their own methods of Shravan month.
When we look around in this season, it seems as if the earth has dressed green shawls.
Everywhere a new energy is transmitted.
In this holy month many devotees go to Kavad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while some people fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami.
During this time, Rakhi Purnima is also a symbol of the love of brother and sister.
If the discussion of the month of Shravan is going on, you will be happy to hear that this time more than four years devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave since July .
More than the devotees who participated in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, have participated in just 28 days.
I also appreciate the success of the Amarnath Yatra, especially the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those people who come back from the journey are filled with the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I have also been told that since the start of Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half.
For the first time since the terrible disaster in 2013, such number of pilgrims have reached there.
I urge all of you to go to such areas in which the natural beauty was seen during monsoons.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage is not a greater teacher.
May this beautiful month of Shravan bring new energy, new hopes and new hopes to you all, I wish you all the best.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of uit India Movement.
I want you to make some special preparations for August 15 and find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
When we watch TV, we look at the same aspect of rains - floods, water streams, traffic frozen moons and other portraits of the monsoon, our farmers, swinging birds, flowing waterfalls and green shallow land, we will have to leave ourselves with families.
Rains, freshness and joy bring both freshness and happiness with us.
My dear countrymen, where to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stay, it feels very difficult, but the time is limited.
I extend my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you will be busy in the examination.
Today, we are mostly waiting for the coordination between India and Australia.
India has won the fight against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come for a new revolution in this sports world.
And you can see that there is a nutritious environment for football, hockey, tennis and kabaddi, just like cricket in India.
You may have known that India is hosting the FIFA i. e.
24 teams from all over the world will be going to play in India.
At the same time, on the other hand, I see that the attraction of football in the youth is increasing, whether it is EPL or Spanish lig or Indian superligation.
Young friends take time to know about these solutions, to see them on television.
How will the competition of connecting itself with sports between governance, academic institutions and social organizations stand
We see that all this has happened in the matter of cricket.
But we have to prepare this environment for other sports.
This is a golden jubilee to identify India.
My dear students, you must have decided about tourism in these holidays.
And I remember that the work that we did not get to our tourism department, our cultural department was not possible, which the state governments could not do and the government of India could not do, it was done by crores of tourists.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there will be no such district in India where I have not gone.
I extend my special greetings to Coal India.
And I am happy that nearly 10,000 citizens have visited the Sawaner coal mine near Nagpur as a tourist.
Tourists and tourist residents are also seeing some efforts from both of them .
All efforts are being made even though not of a classical system.
Will we also pay special attention to this
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Employment generation is possible through the tourism sector.
In terms of tourism India is far behind in comparison to the world .
But if we decide to focus on the tourism sector, we can attract the world to India.
A large part of the tourism sector around the world can attract our country and create employment opportunities for millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is governance or institutions or society or citizens, we all have to work together.
Let us try to do this.
My young friends, I don't realise this thing that has come to Suttya and this has gone.
If you are not able to swim, you should decide to learn to swim in these beds.
If you cannot drive a bicycle in these beds then you can learn a bicycle in these beds.
Even today, while typing on the computer I do with two fingers, why should not I learn to do clean typing
There are many skills for our personality development.
You will be able to see that after the start of the school after the holidays, you will go back to the college and tell your friend that I have learnt this on this holiday and if you do not learn anything then you will say that
My time was left and you only came to learn new things.
Friends, there will be mutual discussions on this.
This time there have been several information on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji.
In the last holidays of summer we had told that the leopards also suffer from the problem of summer so that they keep water filled in a pocket in their balcony or balcony for sparks.
I have done the same thing and I am happy to say that this has led to my friendship with the chimneys.
He called me and reminded me of an artificial work .
Last time I remembered and I had said that in the summer season, for the birds, keep water filled in the utensils of the soil outside your side.
He told me that he would do this throughout the year and has been friendly with many moments.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet of Hindi literature, had a great love for birds.
He had written in his poems: Do not let you go away, will fill the courtyard with donations and will fill the hod in Ham salt and sweet water.
Let us also do this thing by Mahadevi ji.
I congratulate and thank you for bringing in mind a very important issue.
Have we given them water during summer days
I am extremely grateful to you people, I thank you very much and you have given a sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
Yes, this is a habit in India.
But I express my gratitude to you for having seen this thing briefly.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard of Digital India Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is just a world of youth in the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to hear that a Kisan Facilitation App has been prepared for your service.
If you download the Kisan Facilitation App in your mobile phone then you will be able to get a lot of information about agriculture and climate.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download the Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phones.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Summer is the time of holiday for others but summer is the time for the farmers to sweat.
He waits for rain.
The time before the commencement of the direct season of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also consider what will happen to us by drinking water.
The water streams, the ponds, the water streams, the ponds, the water streams, the ponds, the ponds and the ponds, where some waste is accumulated or some extremism has occurred, the water streams stop coming and the result is that water streams slowly decrease.
In the first rains, water was saved, ponds were filled, river drains were filled, then even if it did not rain then it would be less damaged.
You must have seen this time that we have decided to prepare 5 lakh farms.
The emphasis has been laid on creating water resources to store water through MNREGA.
There will be so many such villages across the country, how many progressive farmers will be, how many aware people will be, who have done this thing.
However, there is a need to do more work today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, today I will tell you again that the Government of India had recently organized a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I have seen how modern technology has come into the field.
But it is still left to reach the farm directly.
The farmers are now engaged in reducing the use of fertilizers.
We should follow this mantra, we should take our agriculture sector forward by using scientific methods.
I hope that we will complete the work required for water conservation in the next one-two months.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Vijay on diabetes is the announcement of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was about 6.
3 percent of deaths have been found to be caused due to diabetes .
The whole world is worried about diabetes and the theme of victory over diabetes has been decided on the occasion of World Health Day on 7th April.
We all know that our lifestyle Type 2 is the main cause of diabetes .
If we like yogasanas then do yogasanas.
Otherwise do the exercise at least walking , running .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We sometimes feel hesitant to examine health.
And when the health becomes very bad, it is known that diabetes has already swelled in our body.
This means that this is such a disease which is possible to get quick check up done .
My dear countrymen, we are working hard on this.
Whether it is tuberculosis or diabetes, I would urge you to complete elimination of it.
And therefore, I urge all the countrymen to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
Particularly on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
A Panchthirtha - his birthplace in Mahu.
In London, where he took higher education, Nagpur, where he took the test.
I am fortunate to visit Mahu at the birth place of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Babasaheb has given you a lot to become a good citizen.
We can pay homage to him by following the path shown by him and being a good citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Sanvatsara will start, new record will come up.
They are celebrated in different states in different forms.
You can hear your mobile phone.
We just have to give a missed call.
You call Missed Col.
If you want to listen to the earlier programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can hear it in your language.
I would be happy to stay with you through this medium.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you.
How can this World Cup enhance the interest of sports among the youth of India
Let us also participate in this.
He sent photographs of some such places and uploaded the photographs that it was really pleased to see.
If you want to see something like Shauk-e-Didar Haii, then you can first see it.
The place where no one has gone before, his desire to reach there.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Savner place near Nagpur, are coal mines.
When people go to tourism then they buy something or the other.
If he is a poor person, even if he is a rich person, he will spend more.
I ask you a question to think about it.
Shall we compil ourselves with a new art and skill in these books for achieving a new thing in our personality
Why should not you increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not come
Hey, let's start, let's go.
For personality development, for learning new arts, for skill enhancement, use holidays.
There are countless areas.
The sculpture of Mysore has presented a sensitive issue to all of us.
If you ask them a question of yours then they will answer it, let us understand it.
And once you use it, see what is your usefulness in it
And yet, if you feel something wrong then let me complain about it.
Save water in the villages.
How can the drops of water be saved in the coming rains
How will the water of the village stay in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have sickened our land due to the use of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spices, would you like to eat food
That food will not be liked.
But today we have become negligent about tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to My Mann Ki Baat from radio.
You will now have the idea of exams.
I also want to join you in your journey.
I feel as much carefully as you look at your children's examinations.
But if we change our vision of looking at the examination then we can become anxiety free.
I had told you in the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme that send your experiences and your information to me on the Narendra Modi App.
I am happy to note that teachers and students who have achieved great success in their lives and the interests of the society have written a lot of things to me.
Today, I want to speak to my parents, students and teachers from the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I will tell you what I have heard and what I have read and what I have been told, what I want to tell myself.
But I am confident that the students who are going to meet the examination will definitely be useful for my 25-30 minute interaction.
My beloved student friends, what would be useful for me when I started the Mann Ki Baat today, from a well-known opener in the world before talking to you
Their experiences will definitely be useful to you.
I am aware that the examination will start in a few days.
Some of you will be under tension.
I have the same message.
You and your parents will expect from you, keep your teachers, keep other members of your family and keep your friends.
Wherever you go, all of you will think how your preparations are going on
How much qualities will you get
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of hopes.
In the last 24 years, there have been several difficult moments and many times there have been good moments.
But the expectations of the people were always there and the hopes of the people continued to grow as the time was going on.
And I needed to find a solution for that.
Then I thought that I would automatically expect myself and set my own goals.
My attention was focused on Chendoo and then all the goals were achieved from you.
Friends, What was Tendulkar ji saying
Don't go under the burden of expectations.
You have to make your future.
Why should you spend your time to compete with others
You will see that no one will be able to stop you from moving forward and you will be able to succeed even more than the success you have achieved before, then you will not need to depend on any other person to enjoy and satisfy.
You will experience self-esteem.
Friends, Exams do not obey the sports of quality and statistics.
Where did we reach, how much did we get
Don't get stuck in this area.
This is known by these examinations, whether our pace is right, it is understood by these examinations.
And that is why if your dreams are vast and vast then the exam will be a festival of joy on its own.
And that is why what will happen this year and what will happen in this examination
Do not keep yourself limited at all this .
We will not feel disappointed, we will be inspired to make more efforts with greater zeal and stronger efforts.
Thousands of citizens have written and sent small issues from their mobile phones.
In fact, 365 days should be consistent with our daily routine, our dreams and concepts throughout the year.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddy has raised a question that he slept on time and urges him to wake up early in the morning and shine up his studies.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy said that with the entrance card and other necessary things, the test centre should be reached in time.
I do not have the courage to say that because I am not very serious about sleeping.
And many of my friends have complaints that I do not take enough sleep.
During the exams, I would like to talk about sleeping for you to examine in a stress-free state.
Do you not do this
I am sure, I will not do it.
Depression in life is the main reason for strengthening the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also gets worse.
And that's why don't understand anything small.
Make sure, look at it.
The negative effect of those tensions which are under this tension falls on their results .
And on the strength of the study I have done, I will send a question paper with confidence that if any question paper comes, I will leave it with determination.
Let us know from them the way to achieve success by cutting this test.
Namaskar I am Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me start with your best wishes for the examination.
I will now tell you how to go for my examination and my experience about it.
I am told that the exams are similar to the problems that happen after your existence.
You should rest properly , take a calm sleep at night , you should eat throughout your stomach , you should definitely not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should remain calm .
All this is like the left of the intellect .
When you play, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know what is going to happen in the same class, you don't know what is going to happen in the examination
That is why if you remain calm and you have eaten all over the stomach , you have sleeped properly then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
That's why it's calm.
Do not let yourself stress too much , do not keep very much expectation .
This is important, look at this as a challenge - can I get what I have taught in a year, can I solve this question
At the last moment, reflect the most important thing, remember what you do not remember, you will probably remember with teachers or students, and this will help you to remember a lot about that subject.
If you look at the difficult questions then you will know that they are new questions for you and then when you give the exams then you will be able to solve them better.
Therefore, stay calm and take a good sleep at night, do not show much confidence but also do not remain disappointed at the same time.
I have always seen that you were afraid that these tests are better than that.
And you must have seen them while playing with international intellect, how they sit firmly.
It is true that it is difficult to say so, but it should be tried.
If you don't talk to friends, go alone, stay like a comezoon gelley, keep on washing the book till the last moment, then your mind will not remain calm.
If the water is calm then the objects of deepness are also seen but if the surface of water is swallowed then nothing below is visible .
At that time one feels the tension inside .
Then I feel that if you take some rest then it will be better .
For this, I have developed a mechanism myself.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply three times, five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after this my mind becomes calm and is ready to understand the subject.
It is also possible that my experience will also be useful to you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
Whatever my apple writes, at least half a day, we should spend time with our friends and families in happiness.
And what do you do
Friends, Do not do this.
If you have gone somewhere along with parents then remember that moment , after coming out of the examination give it for at least half an hour .
Rajat ji has to understand the issue.
Friends, What will I tell you about the subject of peace
Today, before you get the examination, a person who has sent a message to you that is basically a teacher and today a meaningful teacher has become a teacher.
He is trying to bring the great epics of Ramcharit Manas with the present times to the world and all over the country.
The revered Murari Bapu has said a clue to the students.
Friends, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
G.
It is certain that Yoga is a gurukilli in the journey to develop the semi-dimension of life.
Take care of this .
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, you have a very wound to go to the exam centre and do you want to go to Patna and sit on your back
Otherwise there is tension in the mind .
If you understand that information then you will not have the time to repent.
I have also seen that the form of the question paper has changed.
Rao in his message highlighted the issue of patience.
However, in the least words, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that the tests also cause restlessness due to competitive examinations.
Don't care.
Give me your best, this is my young friends.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
You should decide what you want to do in your life and do not leave it, you will succeed.
Don't forget that you are the world's writers, you have the right to stay here just like trees and mountains.
You need it to be of dedication, dedication and deliberation.
These qualities will succeed in all your examinations and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you all for what you want to do.
Several blessings.
In the past, how is a scientist's method of communicating
It takes me half an hour to say that it is said in three minutes.
This is the power of science and it is the power of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children across the country.
He spoke of dedication, determination, dignity.
Friends standing steady.
If you stand firmly then you will also be afraid of fear.
And the golden future will wait for you to get achieved by your hands.
Ruchika Dabus has sent a message to me.
And this is true, Sachin ji also said that positive approach, positive condition of mind, positive energy.
Do not think that sometimes there are many things that inspire you, only the students get inspiration.
At any point of life, at any point of life, the best generosity, the truth happenings give us a great inspiration, give us great strength and at the time of crisis, we can get a new path on this inspiration.
We read in the curriculum about Thomas Alva Edison, the father of the lightning light.
But Friends, Have you ever thought how many years he spent for this discovery
Even though he had not taken some special education on mathematics, Ramanujan emphasized the importance of mathematics in various fields such as mathematical classification and analysis.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this strength was important for him.
In today's times, examinations are not only for students but also for all families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal said that the parents should not put the burden of their expectations on the children.
And by looking at this, we don't like to get hands with that trick.
We also want to progress at the rapid pace of science.
This is the reason why today is the National Science Day.
He became the standard of the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And as a commemoration of that, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day throughout the country.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
Every generation has to pay attention to new innovations.
New innovations are not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on the occasion of National Science Day, new innovations should be encouraged all over the country.
I am Sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when it gets success, it also changes its vision of looking at the world.
You must have heard that in the past few days there has been a discovery of great and important science in the world.
Scientists from all over the world have worked hard, many generations have come, some or the other.
This discovery has strengthened the principles of the great scientist Iinstein in the last century and not only has it become a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire humanity will be beneficial to the whole world.
We are extremely proud and happy to be an Indian that our sons and skilled scientists of our country shared this process of research.
Our scientists will make efforts to further this innovation in the coming days.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, a significant decision has been taken in this regard recently.
The Government has decided to set up Lesser Interfameter Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to achieve the next venue of this research.
There are two such centres in the world, the third will stay in India.
Indias participation will give a new strength and new pace to this process.
India will be actively involved in this great scientific discovery of human welfare with the emphasis of limited resources.
My dear countrymen, I tell you the number one.
You will be able to hear Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving missed calls on this number.
We can also hear in our mother tongue.
The number of missed calls is 81908 81908 I repeat 81908 81908.
Friends, Your exams are going on and I have to examine tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my tests.
Just yesterday, I got a test that the licence will start with you.
And when we all succeed, the country will succeed.
Friends, I wish you all the best.
Being free from the stress of success, go ahead with a free mind, stay stable.
In the last Khepes Mann Ki Baat, I spoke two things.
Recently, we celebrated the Christmas festival and now we have started preparing for the New Year's welcome.
India has been diversified.
Festivals are irrigated.
Sometimes it seems that India is a country where the economy is based on festivals.
Whether it is a crisis-free world, terrorism, global temperature rise, natural crisis or man-made, all humanity and peace, what is the greater pleasure
You know that I use technologies abundantly and I get immense information about various subjects.
I always see the MyGov portal.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas holidays .
However, Sawelashwarkar says that where there are tourist places, dharamshalas, religious places, there are special attention should be given to cleanliness.
And the guest Devo Bhav, we say that the guests will come to our house when we clean the house, we decorate the house.
Therefore, we have to pay special attention to the cleanliness of our tourist destinations, religious places.
Dip Singh Malviya lives in Bhojpura village in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh at one age.
I thought it came to my reading and reached you.
Deep Singh Malviya, who lives in Chhotayasya village, decided that if anyone provides toilets, he will not take the construction work, he will make the construction of toilets free of cost.
Assuming that the construction of toilets is a sacred task, Dip Singh built 100 toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Deep Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the uninterrupted hard work of many people.
When every Indian knows that everyone has been attracted to Yoga and the whole world celebrated International Yoga Day and the whole world is connected then we believe that this is our India.
This belief, this feeling arises in your mind only when we see a huge form.
The topic of cleanliness is now being discussed in a way at home.
The participation of citizens in them will increase.
The biggest benefit of this thing is that those government employees who are working to provide electricity to the villages, they will be satisfied, they will be able to make the lives of a village transformative, they will be able to enjoy the media that they have done the work of transforming the lives of a village, be it the farmers, the poor, the women and the youth.
If they don't want to reach any government and don't do any work, then they have the right to get that thing and they should not lose it.
We all have to make efforts to reach out to the common man and to reach out to them the best things, good things and useful things.
Doing this is a service in a way.
I have made this a small effort on my behalf.
I can't do all this alone, but when I tell you, I should not do anything.
We have to reach 125 crore countrymen.
How will I reach without your help
Let us reach them in the language of common man and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, in my address from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had made a first discussion on the theme Startup India Standup India.
After that, the work started in every account of the government, in every department.
Can India be the world capital in start-ups
In a new way, with new innovations, start-ups will be an excellent opportunity for the youth of our states, be it manufacturing sector or service sector or agriculture sector.
In every case, there is a need for new ideas, new experiments, innovations, and the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will present the full action plan of Start-up India Stand-up India.
But it is not at all that we have to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friend hopes that a poor person works for the sake of labour and compassion, the hard work of this person should be lightened, the hard work should be reduced.
I urge the state governments to take initiatives in this regard.
I will speak to you in detail on this subject on January 16.
I will always welcome your suggestions.
Dear young friends, 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, crores of people of this country have inspired Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 12 January 1995.
This year, the event will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
I know that this year's theme is Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormoney.
He observed accessible India Day in his school and expressed his feelings on telephone.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in the society, there are many ideas in mind.
Now it is true that every word has its own different importance .
I would be going to the programme that the Government of India launched Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan this year, but I was not able to attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in the Mahapura in Chennai.
But I was thinking of going to that programme.
I felt that in our country we should use the term 'Divyang' instead of the word 'Divyang'.
These are the persons who have only or more such parts in which divineity, divine power and divine power are transmitted which are not like us with the people.
I liked this word very much.
Will the people of my country now propagate the word 'Divyang' instead of disabled
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
Implement the necessary infrastructure and bring it in direct and indirect, and make it easier for the persons with disabilities.
There are many things like schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, ramps at railway stations, accessible parking, accessible transportation, braille scripts, etc.
They like this.
You should also participate in this in your own way.
My dear countrymen, government schemes continue to come continuously, but this scheme should not only be artificial but also conscious of it.
It should reach the last component well.
In the files their breath should not be lost .
Because these schemes are being formulated, the Government of India has made an effort a few days ago to bring the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor and to the needy.
In our country, subsidy is given to LPG cylinders.
We did not have the system to ensure that the amount was not reached in the right time to the beneficiaries.
The government has changed it a little.
With the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account, Aadhar Card, the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT) scheme was implemented and the amount of subsidy was deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I am proud to note that this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
The scheme is known by the name of 'Pahal'.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG holders have been beneficiaries of the initiative.
This subsidy has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
No broker, no one needs any recommendations, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the Jan Dhan Accounts are being opened and on the other hand, the list of beneficiaries and beneficiaries of the state government and central government is being linked to Aadhaar number and account number.
A few days ago, MNREGA through which employment opportunities are available in the villages.
There were many complaints about it.
I am convinced that about 35 to 40 schemes are now being included under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a golden moment of Indian Republic Day.
The centenary of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar is the centenary year.
In the Parliament, there was a two-day special discussion on the Constitution and it was done in a very good manner.
All the parties have discussed the sacredness of the incident, the importance of the incident, the original sequence of the incident. We have to continue this initiative.
Can we do the task of connecting people with power and power with the people on the occasion of Republic Day
The incident has given us a lot of rights, it has always been discussed and should have happened.
It is our sacred duty to vote on the walls of the elections.
What does not happen in every day's life as our duty was discussed during the voting
Speaking on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, what is the need to organize essay competitions, poetry competitions and lecture competitions in schools, colleges, villages and society institutions in the city
125 crore Indians have taken a step forward by taking one step after another with a sense of duty and a great history can be created.
I want to know your ideas.
Send your writings to my portal MyGov.
I want to know what the young generation thinks about the duties of my country.
And I do not speak at the government level.
We build the statues of great men with great devotion, but then we are desperate to take care of them.
On the other hand, the preparation of patrons has also started.
Festivals have their own importance in society.
Sometimes these festivals bloom on sadness and sometimes new ones .
But sometimes if there is a crisis during these festivals then it is very painful.
There are constant news of natural disasters from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or thought.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is taking place.
In the last few days in our country, the manner in which there is heavy rainfall and untimely rains and the way in which there has been damages in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
My thoughts are with all those families in this crisis.
The State Governments are working with full force to help and rescue them.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis on Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward with confidence and his role in the development of the country will be overcome.
But when we see the crisis all around, we need to make many changes in it.
15 years ago, Natural Disaster was a part of the Department of Agriculture because at that time natural disasters were confined to the same time.
Today the form of this is changing.
It is imperative for us to increase our capabilities at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens, all the small and big institutions will have to work with the vision of science.
After the Nepal earthquake, I interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and suggested that we should come together to conduct a joint study to prepare for disaster resilience.
I am happy that the workshop on SAARC countries' seminars and excellent measures took place in Delhi.
There has been a good start.
Today, Lakhwinder Singh telephone me from Jalandhar in Punjab.
I speak from Jalandhar district of Punjab.
We do organic farming here and also guide many people about this farming.
I have a question that those people who set fire to cattle or wheat plants do not remember how they can guide the microbes of the land and how to get rid of the pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.
I am very happy to hear the question of Lakhwinder Singh.
First of all, you are a farmer of organic farming and you are not only doing organic farming but also know the problems of the farmers well.
Your concern is going on but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is a habit of people from all over India and in a traditional way we burn the remaining remains of crops.
But the pain you have expressed is right .
The first measure of this is that we should train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and tell them the truth that if the remaining remains of the crops are burnt, the time is saved and the crops are being prepared for the next crop.
But this is not true.
We destroy them but if we make small pieces of these ruins then it will be a dry feed for animals.
Secondly, after burning it burns the upper surface of the ground.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for a while, think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, everything should be well but if the skin of the body is burnt then what will happen
Even if the heart is healthy, we can not live.
Just as the skin of our body burns then it is difficult to stay alive , the same way the skin of the damp mother also burns not only on the skin of the crops .
Animals will be used as fodders, not only save their land, but they will also be benefitted by putting the fertilizer produced in the same land.
The water in those pits is sufficient for the crop and today their pits have also got the price.
They are now getting income from these pillars.
Earlier, the pits which had to be spent for cleaning have also become a source of income and the demand for them is increasing.
Dear countrymen, the upcoming 3rd December will be celebrated as International Disability Day all over the world.
27th November was celebrated as Indian Organ Donation Day.
Film actor Ravina Tandon and other dignitaries participated in the event.
Due to organ donation many precious life can be saved .
Organ donation provides immortality in a way .
When any organ goes from one body to another body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be better than this
A National Registration on Organ Transplant has been started on 27th November for patients, organ teeth and organ transplants.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this field and in fact, the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be found until any organ donation is done.
As I said earlier, 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also adventurous and capable .
When such people are neglected then they are tortured.
Sometimes compassion is shown on them.
But if we change our vision of looking at them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live life.
You can inspire to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we are crying.
Then we remember that the crisis on me is very small.
How would it live our life
How do you do the work
And that is why all these are inspirations for us.
His determination, his way of living in life and his ability to reverse the crisis is also worth enhancing.
I would like to tell him today that he is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Jayd Ahmad was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
One part of stomach and intestine also lost .
Pearl also suffered serious injuries.
He lost his strength to stand on his feet, but he did not lose his defeat.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How can we develop facilities for disabled people in public places and government offices
They are working on these issues.
Is Jayd's life not enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
I specially remember Javed Ahmad Jis life work, his penance and dedication on 3rd December.
I have not only mentioned Jayd but also have inspired many such inspirations in every corner of the country.
They are giving new lights to live and showing new paths.
The middle class, the junior middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the underprivileged, the underprivileged have a constant relationship with the government and the government system. And a citizen has ever had a bad experience of some or the other government employees and that bad experience changes his vision of looking at the government system throughout his life.
There is also a fact in this but lakhs of people of this government do such a good job with service and dedication which never gets a vision.
Last year, we had jointly conferred a combined Padma Vibhushan to both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates.
They do social work in a big way in India.
He has spent his life and time after his retirement. He has spent his work for the poor.
When he comes to India, he has got the opportunity to work with the ASHA workers so much and appreciates how dedicated and hard work they are.
He tells them how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovatively.
A few days ago, the Government of Odisha honoured the Independence Day of an ASHA worker.
And a hope worker from this village, Jamuna Manisingh, decided that I will not let anyone in Tedagaon die due to malaria.
To reach every household of them, to know that there is a slight fever.
There will be many more such 'Jamuna Mani'.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We can see them with a little respect.
Such people become the biggest strength of our country.
How the society becomes a big partner of happiness and grief.
I sing the pride of all such ASHA activists through 'Jamuna Mani'.
My dear young friends, I am especially for younger generations who are active on internet and social media.
Not only this, show them to others, it can be read and it can be possible to add something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to participate in this nation building.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global temperature rises are being discussed everywhere, there is a caution and it has been approved as a standard before doing every work.
The temperature of the earth should no longer increase .
It is everybody's responsibility and care.
And the first way to prevent temperature rise is energy savings.
14th December is National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
Once I had said that on the night of the full moon, the lamps of the road should be closed and darkened and stay in the light of the moon for hours.
The light of that moon should be experienced.
On seeing the woman named Noorjahan on TV in Kanpur it seemed that she did not get the opportunity to get much education .
But he is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has ever thought about it.
It is enhancing the lives of the poor using solar energy.
They are fighting with darkness and are burning their lives.
She has prepared a committee of women and has set up a solar plant with solar energy and pays a lease of Rs 100 per month.
What kind of help is being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earnings, empowerment.
However, the speed at which I want to go is still left.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
And I am glad that there are 24 lakh women out of 66 lakh women and the SCs, STs and other Backward Classes who are standing on their feet and are trying to run their families with respect.
Abhishek himself has spoken of his enthusiasm.
I also have many news.
Someone has just told me that there is a Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that new entrepreneurs will be created and Shailesh Bhosle did it.
And I was told that in such a short span of time they have returned Rs. 2 lakh to the bank.
He is working to prepare a butterfly.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor more and more.
Indeed, the economy of the country runs the same.
Small and medium enterprises are the economic power of the country.
We have to give him more strength.
Changals have to be done, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, I had discussed Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that have to maintain constant awareness in social life.
Skills under Rashtrayam Jagriyam Vyam are the award of freedom.
How should the programme be planned
I had told you about sending such information.
I was told that there was a lot of information.
But I look forward to more information.
I hope for a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I am confident that your information will definitely be useful.
But I would like to urge you to exercise.
To keep the body healthy definitely use some time of this good season for exercise - yoga .
If it is a season, then we should also make the habit of fun of it.
Once again my best wishes to my countrymen.
Once again, I am visiting you through Mann Ki Baat.
The fifth one-day cricket between India and South Africa is being played.
The name of this cricket malike is Gandhi-Mandela Syridge.
The two teams have won two-two combinations and therefore the importance of the final combination has increased.
My best wishes to all my sportsmen.
Today, I would like to convey my best wishes to the friends of Kannur Akashwani.
I would like to convey my best wishes that when I started the Mann Ki Baat, many people visited the 12th students of Kerala were also associated with this programme.
I want to talk about Kerala once again.
The students of St. Mary Upper Primary School, Kochi, Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't know why these kids surprised me why these thumbs made me a map of India.
When I read his letters, I realized that he had given a message of symbolic.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency .
Those girls have written a letter to me that challenge people about organ donations through your Mann Ki Baat programme.
Sudke Guruji, the 80-year-old Vasantrao of Maharashtra, has constantly started a movement.
He says that organ donation should be a festival .
Halli also sends a lot of messages from telephone.
Devesh in Delhi has given me a message.
I think this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people need kidneys, heart and liver every year in our country.
But in our country with 125 crore population only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplants are operated .
Every year one lakh eyes are required but only 25,000 people get eyes .
When four eyes are required then we can give only one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some States have worked well to accelerate the efforts of these organ donations by reducing paper action.
Today, I can tell you that Tamil Nadu is at the top of organ donation.
A lot of social institutions, a lot of NGOs have given a different direction by working well.
National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTO) has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
Ten Titkaten Bhunjeetha is the best joy to sacrifice.
Last month, we all had seen on TV that the GDP of Delhi was very important.
A life was saved.
Dear countrymen, we have now celebrated Navaratri and Vijayadashmi.
A few days later, we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid was celebrated, Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated.
But we will be proud of this festival that will celebrate one more festival.
The India-Africa Foren Summit will be organised in the capital of India, New Delhi on 26-29 October 2019.
For the first time, such a big event will be held on the Indian soil.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of India is the same as the population of African people.
If both populations are united then one-third of the world's population will be the population.
And it is said that lakhs of years ago, the territory of these two countries was united.
Later, due to the Indian Ocean, the region was divided into two parts.
And see, it is our endeavour to meet the people and come together.
On this occasion, the Government of India has organized a major programme by the HRD Ministry.
An essay competition was organised in the schools of Affiliated Schools of CBSE, a programme for writing poems was organised to increase their participation.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools outside India and India and thousands of schoolchildren had written about strengthening India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar to Memories of Mahatma is a mobile exhibition which is a roaming exhibition from Porbandar to Northern State and reaches Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren have seen this exhibition and people from the villages have also seen this exhibition.
The people knew how great Mahatma Gandhi had played on the relations between Africa and India, how much the impact of Mahatma Gandhis personality was on these two territories.
Well, it is the Indo-Africa Summit but I see this opportunity to connect people.
I congratulate Grimala and the children participating in this, more than 1600 schools and HRD Ministry.
On August 15, I had proposed a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, there was a workshop in Bhopal in which wherever Adarsh Grams were going on, the heads of the village, the collectors there, some of the parliamentarians there, the government of India and the state governments together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
How new things were remembered, some enthusiastic things were remembered.
He has chosen the Parsi Gram Panchayat in Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
The successful effort to consciously consciously consciously with infrastructure and systems in the Adarsh village was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate Honble Parliamentarian Mr. Karia Mundanji.
I got a news from Andhra.
Ashok Gajapati Rajuji Adarsh Gram Yojana, MP from Andhra Pradesh, was very much involved and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat as an ideal village in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
Nearly 550 adult observers were taught by those children and literate them.
See, there is no budget in society, there is no circular, there is no special arrangement, but how big changes are brought about due to will power, it is being seen by the Gram Panchayat.
Well, our respected Parliamentarian Shriyut C.
L. Ruwala is a Parliamentarian of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khwala Hillang village as an ideal village.
This village is very famous for production of sugarcane and jaggery .
How to make the village an economic centre, how to make the market for the products of the village.
Ruwala ji, who is trying to make a self-sufficient village with the ideal village, is eligible for congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, is Mann Ki Baat and it will never happen to be a matter of cleanliness
I would like to remind you of my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media had launched a special mission and after Diwali, all the things that were torn apart have been shown to the people from the channels.
Before the festival, we worry about the accident not happening, we should do it even after the festival.
And for this, I especially want to congratulate the media world of India.
On 2nd October, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I got the opportunity to participate in the Swachhta Sammelan through India Today Group on the occasion of one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
While giving Clean India Awards, I also saw how efforts are being made.
How people are working like One Life, One Mission for this purpose.
What are the places in our country which have been kept so clean.
Since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan, I have seen that Andhra Telangana's e-Nadu and especially Shriyaut Ramuji Rao are very big but their enthusiasm is going to embarrass any young man, not less than the youth.
He has connected 51 lakh children in about 55-56 schools in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is a public place or a station or a religious place or a park or a big campaign for cleanliness has been launched in many places.
Now this news shows itself the power to realize the dream of Swachh Bharat.
ABP News launched this programme called Bharat Desh Hai Mera and made people aware about cleanliness and trained the countrymen.
NDTV has launched a campaign called 'Swachh Bharat'.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor, Shri Yut Shanmukh Nathan, has written to me a letter and mentioned the village of Mavalai Nanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years, this village has taken a boost to cleanliness.
It is said that almost every generation is dedicated to this sanitation that he had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia a few years ago.
This is important for all of us to believe that our country will definitely be clean and it will be done by the efforts of the countrymen, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say 100 crore people with pride and pride, see, we have freed our land from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had said this from the Red Fort on 15th August, there are some things where there are corruption and houses.
We hear all these news and that is why I thought what is the need of an interview for small jobs.
I have never heard that there is such psychological in the world which can be fully known by taking one or two minutes .
And with this idea, I had announced that we will stop breaking the tradition of childhood for this small job.
My dear young friends, I would like to say with pride that the government has completed all these procedures and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be questioned during recruitment.
This rule will come into force from 1st January 2016 and we will not incur expenditure where recruitment process is going on, but this method will be implemented from 1st January 2016.
So, I wish all my young friends and youngsters.
I had announced an important scheme in the previous budget.
Gold has become an important part of social life in our country.
Golden power can be created, golden economic power can be created.
And every Indian must contribute to this.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you get interest by depositing your money.
Earlier they used to keep in a gold locker and locker fares were also required .
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, cannot become a golden wealth
The second thing is that this bond is a paper in the Sovereign Gold Band, but the value of that paper is the same as gold.
On the day you return this paper, you will get the money back to the price of gold on the day you return it.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quine.
It took about 70 years after the independence of Ashoka Chakra, but till now we have been using the Foreign Gold uin.
Gold Billion Bonds are also used abroad.
We will also provide it to the common man before Dhanteras in the coming weeks and we are launching a golden coin with five grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra.
At the same time 20 grams of gold coin will also be available for the people .
I am confident that the new schemes will bring about new changes in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary.
An India-Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel remembers that India's map comes forward.
This great man has contributed immensely to Indias unity.
India is full of diversity.
India is filled with diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity, diversity and diversity.
If it was not a diversity then we could not be proud of these beauty and beauty.
Therefore, there is a mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, goodwill and unity are the real roots of development.
In the last few years, on 31st October, run-for-unity programmes are being organized in every corner of the country.
'Ekta Ki Run' is also a race for development in true sense.
Pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take the mantra of unity forward.
Dear brothers and sisters, now you have started preparing for Diwali, cleanliness will be done in the house.
You're buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
On the auspicious occasion of Diwali, I convey my best wishes to you lakhs of people.
There is a fire due to cracking, there is a lot of damage to the children due to cracks.
I will tell every mother and mother to enjoy Diwali but do not let an accident happen, do not cause damage to the child of our family and you will have to think about it and clean it.
My dear countrymen, on the second day of Diwali, I will be on a visit to Britain.
The Government of India and the State Governments of India provide scholarships to those children who go abroad for studying these classes of Dalits, tribals, backward and backward.
I am confident that when our children will be taught in Britain, then Baba Saheb's place will become an inspiration for the country. I am telling Baba Saheb that this message has been given by Baba Saheb, I have been thrilled by my visit to Britain for many years.
Now you can imagine how much the people like me will be happy with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar being added to the wealth of the 125 crore countrymen.
I will get another opportunity in London and I will have to unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswar.
The world needs to study the work that Lord Vishwaswar had done for democracy and for the Employment of Women several years ago.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishwaswar on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India think and think with a vision several years ago.
My dear countrymen, you were associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Government officials were interacted and discussed.
Some people write their problems and try to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn these languages
But I am grateful to All India Radio that this Mann Ki Baat broadcasts every state in their regional language at 8 o'clock in the night.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October, I would be fortunate to speak Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
Jan Shakti is of immense importance in democracy.
I have a fundamental idea in my life and that is why I believe in Jan Shakti.
But from the Mann Ki Baat I can tell you that the people's power is unconstitutional.
Our ancestors used to say that Janadan is a part of God.
With the experience of Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that our ancestors have a great power and a truth because I have experienced this thing.
I used to ask the people for the Mann Ki Baat and I used to see only two or four information.
However, lakhs of people were actively sending information.
This is a big power.
When people were watching this, they also felt that the feeling of despair and misery about the girls would have to be changed now.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of the tourism drive in India, I told the citizens, Incredible India, Incredible India, and I will see that you have sent a picture of tourism to me on the gallery.
People from every part of India sent photographs in lakhs.
Never saw the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government that we have such a rich heritage.
All the things came on a platform and the government did not spend a single rupee in it.
People did all this.
Today, I can say with joy and satisfaction that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
Once I used to say in the words of Lan Mann Ki Baat, we see the picture of the poor mothers who are crying in the house of the poor.
Do they not want to get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society, then the government can work as a catalyst for social transformation.
Every small thing has become a small issue and has tried to connect itself for the welfare of the country.
What can be bigger joy than this
I would like to make a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I urge the citizens of the country to get your questions, your information and your proposals from telephone to me.
I will pay attention to it in Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy that more than 5,500 telephones came from across the country, be it Sicilyin, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There will be no such area in India where the citizens did not telephone.
This is a pleasant experience.
The people of all age groups expressed their views and thoughts.
I heard some of them myself and thought that my team works on the proposals on the rest of the issues.
You may have taken one or two minutes to make this telephone, but the delivery, ideas and issues received from it are important for me.
The entire government will definitely work on this.
What is the importance of radio for such blind people
I see from a new perspective and many good things, good issues, are sufficient for the government to be sensitive.
I would like to invite Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to the people of India to make maximum use of soil seeds in Diwali through the Mann Ki Baat this time.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the army for two-three hours.
Naval Staff and Air Force that protects water, land and sky.
The war with Pakistan in 1965 completed 50 years.
We have not only heard about the pride and pride of the war, the occasions, the courage and sacrifices of our soldiers, but also the technologies of photography and artistics are not available but through this exhibition, the moments of the campaign and the sacrifices of the soldiers are realized.
Whether it is the battle of Hajifir or the real north of Chamida or the victory of Hajipir Pass, adventurous thrill stands on the organs and the pride of the Indian Army feels very proud.
If you want to make history then you will have to understand the smaller issues of it.
History keeps our bonds with our children.
If we break the relations with history then the possibilities of making history get a complete stop.
A little child has given an order to the Prime Minister, but he forgot to tell the name of his own.
It is a matter of satisfaction that on October 2, I announced a campaign in the context of Swachh Bharat and I can tell you that for the first time since independence, there is a lot of discussion on cleanliness in the Parliament.
There was also a criticism on our government.
I also have to hear a lot that Modi ji was talking about cleanliness but what happened
I do not feel bad to hear this, but I see a good thing that in the Parliament of the country there is a discussion about the cleanliness of India.
On the other hand, on the other hand, when both of them talk about cleanliness, there can be no such thing for the country.
This movement is going on, awareness about thoughts, cleanliness and cleanliness is being seen.
It will also make the government active, it will be inevitable to do the work and work.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we have worked in that direction to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
What is Mahatma Gandhi saying
At one place he says that if the time comes to choose one of the two freedom and cleanliness, then I will give priority to cleanliness, after independence, cleanliness was more important than independence for Gandhiji.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi has migov.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly inspired by the life of great men.
This great man was a ideologist who is not his own estimation.
All those who live for the country and die for the country are inspiring us.
These days will give us the opportunity to remember all these great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jaiprakash Narayanji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October, I would also say a lot because this country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
Whatever date you take, the name of some great man from the point of view of history will be linked to that date.
I once again urge you, especially for 2nd October.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of revered Bapu is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The work which the government cannot do by administering a huge expenditure was due to your small work and help.
This is the Jan Shakti and therefore, I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, my heart is filled with happiness due to one thing.
Chandra Bose had arranged all the arrangements by the Pune of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took this task in mind and in the last week, there was a strong news that the family members of Subhash Babu would come to the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
He will get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence, often for the first time.
But I am more happy because I have never had such a hospitality before the Prime Minister's residence, which I will be fortunate to do in October.
More than 50 relatives of Subhash Babu, family members, some of the people living in different countries, all the issues will be made available.
How pleasant it will be for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about voting, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and help the younger generation in choosing and running the government in the future.
I hope that the youngsters who have not yet registered their names, they will also register and vote.
Kshitij Pandey, the seventh student, who visits me, is a student of Anaras Hindu University, who learns the seventh century in Kendriya Vidyalaya.
He has a dandaga confidence.
I would have read a lot of interest in physics in this young age.
The daughter of Sadavrat Patel, who lives in Sunderpur, Varanasi.
Her father said that if you take the book of mathematics in the hands, then by the evening, if you open all the mouths, history, then in the evening the whole of the mathematics used to face it.
I am very impressed with this wonder that all the families of us.
Sometimes such children disappear from fame, but I do not know anything about Sonam.
I felt that God has given a power.
Two children who were travelling to Kashi came to meet me.
Similarly, the meeting of these two children would be in my memory.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are suggesting new work for me.
See what Sandeep of Haryana says, Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, you should do it every week because you hear your speeches and get inspired.
Sandeep ji, what did you do from me
I have to do a lot of work once a month, I have to plan time.
At present, it remains once in the month.
Mann Ki Baat is in a way a year.
You know how much to use Subhash Babu radio
He started his radio centres from Germany and used to inform the people of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio in a weekly newspaper.
He used to run the radio through English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and Parsi Urdu languages.
It has also been a year for me to speak Mann Ki Baat from Akashwani.
Sending your information, ideas, proposals.
It also benefits the government.
Reforms start.
Your contribution, your participation is valuable and invaluable for me.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you.
Citizens of South India are blossomed in the festival of Onam and yesterday all the countries celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Considering the issue of social security, the Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time everyone has accepted this scheme.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had requested our sisters to meet these security schemes.
I have been told that since the launch of this scheme, 11 crore families have been connected to them till date and almost the benefits of these schemes have been given to mothers and sisters.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, while speaking to you, it has been a year since the Jan Dhan Yojana has been launched in large numbers.
Bank Mitra Yojana has also been strengthened to ensure that the banking sector is an important part of the economy.
Today, more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
You will be happy to hear that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps will be organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not just stopping the accounts open.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facilities under Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also got the facility.
It is believed that the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again I congratulate all those who have opened the bank accounts, I would like to urge the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters to keep their relations in the bank.
This bank is yours, now you do not leave it.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your job to keep it in mind.
Due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the whole country was restless and it is natural that if something happened in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar, then the whole country was shocked first.
But in a very short span of time, all my sworn brothers and sisters of Gujarat brought the situation under control.
He played an active role in the situation and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood should walk shoulder to shoulder while walking on the path of right path and development.
Development is the answer to our problems.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi community.
I got the opportunity to hear their thoughts and tell you the truth, I feel like listening to music in their speeches.
I came to speak to these scholars by selecting their words, the way of speaking, the generosity and harmony in the Sufi tradition, in which there is a rhythm of music.
I felt very fond of it.
There is often a real need for Islam to reach the world.
This message that the Sufi sect has been linked to love and harmony will reach far and wide, which will benefit the human society, Islam will also be good and I tell others that we understand the tradition of any sect, Sufi sect and Sufi.
And I am fortunate that I will get this invitation in the coming days.
The scholars from Buddhist traditions from all over the world will be visiting India and Bodh Gaya, discussing the good of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am glad that I have received an invitation to visit Bodh Gaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodh Gaya.
It is a pleasant moment for me that I will get the opportunity to visit Bodh Gaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you the point of view of my mind.
I had also spoken this subject before Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard that in my speech in the Parliament, from the public meetings, from the Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have come to tell you that the government of India is open in the matter of the land acquisition law that is going on.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to assure that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just an announcement for us.
This is the mantra for the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August, we were told that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are promptly implementing this decision.
The war of 1965 was completed two days ago and when the theme of the war of 1965 came out, it was naturally reminded of Lal Bahadur Shastriji.
I salute all those who won India in the 65th war and salute the heroes.
Such incidents in history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi community in the last week, I had a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the nominee scientists across the country for hours.
I am happy to know that India has been doing excellent work in the field of science and in many directions.
Our scientists are doing excellent work.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it will be inspiring for me and will teach something new.
And I saw that many young scientists were speaking enthusiastically and many dreams were seen in their eyes.
In the past, I used to say from Mann Ki Baat that students should turn to science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and there is a lot of possibility.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look forward to science, our educational institutions should inspire students for it.
Skill development has been written.
Shri Prakash from Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Emphasis is on reforms in the education sector.
I would like to tell one thing especially to my young friends.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I used to say that for the job at the lower level, for what is this interview
And when letters come for childhood then every poor family, the widow, mother gets into this concern that who will get the recommendations and who will get this job
I don't know what words are used
Everyone had a race and perhaps the lower level of corruption should also be one of the reasons.
I used to say in my speech on 15th August that even though he does not apply to the selector at this lower level, I am happy to say that in such a short span of time, the government has taken several steps in this regard.
The decision will now be implemented to ensure that the information is being sent and the childhood should not be attached to small posts.
It is unfortunate that in our country every year about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die immediately after delivery.
This is worrisome and horrific.
There has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and newborns.
We look at the television in public but do not pay attention, the publicity is published in the newspapers but we do not see it.
Along with pure water, it is important to keep small things clean at home.
Life is extremely precious.
It is not right to ignore polluted water, depression about cleanliness to prove the cause of death.
Dengue testing is done at around 514 centres across the country.
Raksha Bandhan to Diwali is the time of several festivals in our country.
Let us connect with the cleanliness of every festival, see that the quality of cleanliness will come in your nature itself.
I often say that we will not be able to get the fate of laying our lives for the country but it is certain that we will get the fate of living for the country.
Two youngsters and two brothers of our country, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward and this is what ur is filled with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience is different for the youth.
Sometimes we know and learn new things by talking to them.
I have seen many youngsters who have said that I have taken this message on Sanday.
One day in a week is the decision of cycling day.
He said that everyone is happy to be better and young for health, environment.
The attacks in our country will increase the number of bicycle users in many households and many encourage them.
I am happy to note that these are good efforts to protect the environment, to sustain health and today two youngsters of my country have hoisted India's flag in the United States and that is why the youth of India are also thinking about it.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The monument will inspire us to work for Dalits, exploited, oppressed and deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives which have been honoured by Ambedkar.
The country can be taken forward by putting shoulders on the shoulders.
My best wishes to all of you. Thank you very much.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters in the field of kharif.
I remember one more thing that I feel happy and happy.
The cereals and oilseeds have always been broken in our country.
The poor people need cereals, food and vegetables have a little oil.
I am happy that the cereals that have been taken this year have increased by 50 and oilseeds production by about 33.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, this date of July 26 has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
Farmers belong to the land of this country as well as the soldiers.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers broke down on hundred enemies.
The war of Kargil was not just fought on the border, but every city of India, every village was involved in it.
This was the fight for those mothers and sisters whose young sons and brothers fought with enemies in Kargil.
Those youngsters who fought this war, seeing their brave young children, who felt young again, had fought this battle with the fingers of their parents who had not yet learnt to walk.
It is because of the sacrifices made by all of them that India can speak to the world today.
After our government came to power in 2014, we started the MyGov campaign in a few months on 26th July.
We have launched this website to connect every citizen to development work and to increase their participation in democracy.
And today, after a year, I am happy to note that about two crore citizens have visited MyGoV website.
About 5. 5 lakh citizens have reacted, and that is, more than 50,000 citizens have registered information on PMO APLICATIONS.
Is it right that such people have difficulty in taking the ticket of the train
However, this thing looks smaller on the top but the government did not remember this thing.
However, on the issue raised by Akhilesh, the government has seriously considered and today a different system has been implemented for the reservation of tickets for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Halli becomes a new logo, a to-line is created, a programme policy is being formulated, a lot of positive information is received on MyGov.
It is experienced that new winds are flowing in the governance system.
A new consciousness is being felt.
In my speech on 15th August, MyGov information has started to be received to issue issues in my speech.
From Chennai, Sumitra Raghavchari has suggested many things.
I believe that it is a good idea for the citizens of the country to suggest issues for what should happen in my speech on 15th August.
I am sure you will make good information.
I take care of one thing that reaches you.
I do not want to instruct anyone from the responsibility of the central government, state government or local institutions.
Just two days ago, I saw a scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was changing about ten minutes and wounded.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bengaluru, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanti Kakunje of Murbidri in Karnataka, expressed his concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accidents.
However, I urge the parents to take care of their children whether they are driving a bike or a four wheeler or a security alert, they will be taught from the house and the parents will get it from the family.
In this regard, the government has formulated a lot of new policies and initiatives, be it training citizens on road safety, be it road construction system or be it providing immediate assistance to the accident victims.
Keeping in mind all these things, we will introduce the Transport and Security Bill.
We consider taking several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
This scheme is cashless treatment for the highways of Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda, Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
This means that the injured will get immediate medical assistance in 50 hours after the accident and we will give priority to the treatment of the accident victims without any precaution whether the bill will be filled or not.
Toll Free Telephone Number 1033 will be available across the country to provide information about the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that accidents will not take place because the life of each one and everybody is more important.
Sometimes I tell you that the workers should be karmayogi.
In the last few days, I felt like talking to you about it.
But how to bring consciousness in the work taken by the hands
Vijay Biswal showcased how his interests and art capabilities are mixed with his work.
It is likely to be spoken about his picture and I have got the information about another thing.
The entire group of government officials in Madhya Pradesh and Harda district has touched my hearts with a different task and a different mission started by the team.
I like his work and you will feel that it is a different thing that these officers started the campaign Operation Malayalam War.
But it is a matter of fact that he gave a new turn to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
There is a camp named Kesla near the Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh .
The people of this village have constructed toilets with a mission.
Now no one in this village goes to the open for toilets and when the construction of toilets is completed then the village celebrated the festival of Anandotsav.
I have a good example of how the values of social life change, how the mindset of the people changes and how the citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to the North-Eastern region.
However, the people of the North-Eastern region are active.
They will go to the village and speak to the officials of the administration, to the representatives of the people and the citizens.
The central government will do whatever it is possible to solve these difficulties.
A good effort, an effort to move away from Delhi to the east, the Act East Policy, which I say is this.
My dear countrymen, the success of Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and joy for all of you.
We know this news but we don't care about it.
I always tell these officers that the IAS officers of the government should visit a school or college near about two to four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This work is difficult but it has to be done.
During the examination there is no electricity therefore do not break into the study of children .
If you want to start a small business and industry in the village then you will have electricity.
At some places, we have to go to another village to charge the mobile.
We have started it, we must do it.
Today, I felt like talking to you on different topics from Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes to you all.
Definitely send your information and new ideas for 15th August, I will certainly be able to use it.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
I feel that there is something less.
We used to hear a lot of things in the form of a self-sufficient family of 130 crore Indians sitting in our human beings, in a very light environment.
Sometimes your own things were being inspired for us.
You can imagine how this is a holiday period in the middle.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month is 11 o'clock in the morning.
Every moment I feel that I miss something.
And whenever I speak Mann Ki Baat, I speak alone, and that word may be mine, the voice may be mine, but that story is yours, it is yours, it is yours, it is your valour and valour.
I was just using my words and my words.
There was a feeling of absolute emptyness in the mind .
Once in mind, now the elections are over, you will soon come and talk about four things.
But then I thought, no
It is our Sunday program and it should continue.
But these Sundays only made a lot of wait.
Small, simple and simple things are also the reason for bringing about changes in the lives of the society.
This is a part of it and this order gives birth to a new energy, pure consciousness and in one sense we have to move forward by keeping this order in mind the consciousness and energy of New India.
In the last few months, there have been several messages in which innumerable people are missing Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read and hear this message, I feel very happy.
This is my journey from Ahm to Vayam.
This silence dialogue with you for me was also a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people have asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in the Dhamdhumi of elections.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will be keen to know the answers to these questions.
Only one tells me that the slightest vacancies given to Mann Ki Baat had created in my mind and I feel that in the valleys of Kedar, in the cave alone, perhaps the mind must have got the opportunity to fill this pocket.
Just as many people have expressed their desire to know about the visit of Kedar and your efforts to strengthen a positive thing, I feel consistent with your speeches.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, which are inputs, are different from routine, that is, daily government work.
Sometimes you have sent letters also become the reason for inspiring me.
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes.
I understand the challenges faced by the country and the society.
At the same time, people also say what is the answer to these problems.
I have seen that in the letters, people express their problems and also write what answers they have.
Answer to the links of questions, some new ideas, directly or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and society.
Today, my heart has been filled with great happiness.
In the last time, I had said that now we have met in three-four months, some people had taken out the political meaning and said, "Hey, Modi ji has so much confidence and he has so much confidence.
This self-confidence was not of Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
All of you have taken the form of trust.
And that is why I had said in the last Mann Ki Baat that now I will be talking to you after a few months.
And you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we move with this feeling then we will continue the order of Mann Ki Baat as before.
The movement was not limited to the prison.
There was an anger in the minds and hearts of the people.
There was a stride in the mind of the democracies.
Whenever we get food from time to time, we don't understand what hunger is.
Likewise, someone shares the importance of democratic rights and at the same time he understands.
Every citizen of the country feels that in the times of emergency, you will be able to share something.
Even if someone smiles the thing we have never used, then it will be sorry and painful.
Some arrangements have been made in the Constitution of India, so that democracy has come here.
There is also a need for an incident to run a social system.
Laws and regulations are also required and rights and duties are also discussed.
But India is proud and proud to say that there is a greater edition of democracy for us than laws and regulations.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage.
And we have become a small man with this legacy.
Therefore, the country had called for a full election not for ourselves but for the protection of democracy.
We have easily taken the precious democracy that we have got.
In India, more than 61 crore people got the right to vote in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
But if the share of the world was to be shared then I would like to say that if one has left China then more than the population of any other country has left the right to vote in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States and almost double.
More than the population of the entire Europe, there are more voters in India.
You can imagine how much resources and human resource are required to observe this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and staff worked hard day and night and could cross the elections.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have fulfilled their responsibilities to achieve this great sacrifice of democracy.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked hard.
You can imagine how widespread the total election was.
All these voters were supposed to be deprived of their electorate, to ensure that all eligible voters have the right to vote.
In remote areas like Arunachal Pradesh, a single female voter was made a polling station.
You will feel new to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two-two days to reach that remote place.
Besides, there has been a matter of pride in this election.
I extend my best wishes to the Election Commission and to every person involved in this election process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you all have often heard from my mouth that I request books or books.
We all can give books instead of flowers while welcoming.
After listening to this, people have started welcoming books at several places.
I have recently visited a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniyan'.
I liked this visit very much.
However, I could not get a lot of time but during the journey I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
In his stories, Premchand has depicted the truth in the society, while reading it, the pictures of that time have to be produced in front of our eyes.
Every description he wrote, every thing is alive.
His stories seem to have an emotional integration of the entire India.
While reading the story of 'Nasha' he wrote, my mind ran through the question of economic inequality in the society itself.
I remember the time of my youth.
Our youth used to debate overnight on the economic inequality of the society.
It shows the sensitivity of a child, the immense mother in her mind, the maturity of the ideas at such a young age.
When Hamid of 4-5 years comes to us today with a glimpse of glimpse from the fair, human sensitivity reaches a very high summit, the story will ultimately make the verse reader very emotional.
In this story, one of the poor farmers' lives are very lively portrayed.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village situated in the very dense forest of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
Muralidharan and a small tea shop driver P.
V.
Chinnathampi, both of them started the library with tireless hard work.
Sometimes both of these books used to make bundles and take books from our backs to our village in the jungle.
Today, this library is working to show a new direction to everyone along with tribal children.
The mission of 'Vanka Gujarat' in Gujarat has been a good success.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and read books.
In today's digital age, during the time of Google Guru, I urge you to keep your books in your daily work for a while.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country not only think of the present times but also think of the future challenges.
When I was reading the response you sent to the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remember that many people have written a lot about the water problem.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Success Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about the challenges related to water.
Water is equal to Mother and we should get maternal blessings and the grace of Mother Jalrupi remains upon us.
Due to the deficiency of water, there is dryness in many parts of the country every year.
We save only eight percent of water and therefore we need to solve this problem.
Just as we have solved many other problems with Jan Bhagidari and Jan Shakti, we will find solutions to water problems with all the capabilities, with all the collaboration and determination.
Keeping in mind that the importance of water is the highest, the country has now become a new Jal Shakti ministry.
This will enable speedy decision-making on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote letters to Sarpanches and Gram Pradhan from all over the country.
In order to save water, to keep water storage, do not drop rain drops, to save rain water, the village heads should speak to the Gram Sabha and the meeting.
The resolution has been made to save every drop of water in villages and villages and to save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you about a Sarpanch.
The people there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Gram Pradhans, all Sarpanches and all the Sarpanches for saving water.
Several structures across the country have made such a pledge for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
Therefore, the people of the village are now in the competition to build a water temple in their villages.
I have already said that if collective efforts are made then there are very good positive results.
There cannot be a single specific formula to overcome water conservation across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But the goal of all is one and that is water conservation and water conservation.
The work is being done to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These will solve the problem of sucking water.
Due to the construction of water tanks in Thimaipalli in Telangana, the lives of the people of the village are changing.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a big change.
I was read about the collective efforts made in Vellore in Tamil Nadu that 20 thousand women came together to revive the Naga river.
I also read that the women of Garhwal are working together in a very good way for Rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that when we all work together and strive firmly, it becomes impossible.
When everyone will be involved in the work of water conservation, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to ask the countrymen for three things.
My first request is that just as the people of the country have transformed the Swachhta Abhiyan as well as initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is a prasad of God.
Earlier, we used to say that the touch of Paris was made of iron gold.
I say that water is a preservation, and Paris means that water touches are creating a new life.
A awareness campaign should be launched to save every drop of water.
Make the society aware and connect with society.
I urge you all to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If anyone of you gets the opportunity to visit Porbandar at the birthplace of revered Bapuji then he must have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapuji.
That is why I always say that if someone goes to Kirti temple then he must see the storage tank of water.
Let us make a list of water conservation related methods and encourage people to conserve water.
You all can share your information using JanshaktiforJalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude for one more thing.
He told me through a tweet how the Presidents, the Prime Ministers, the dignitaries and the common citizens of the world celebrated Yoga Day in their country.
On that day, the whole world looks happy and happy with a family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Then don't you want to respect such services by recognising them
The Prime Minister's Award was announced this year to promote Yoga in 2019 and contribute excellently to development.
This is inspiring.
Now, if Yoga is going on, then in this area, Indians are not behind.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also been awarded and have been dedicated to Yoga for the last few decades.
My dear countrymen, your journey is starting today, new feelings, new feelings, new resolutions, new powers, but I will continue to wait for your advice.
Let us continue to meet and speak.
I hear your feelings and keep your mind alive.
Sometimes I try to live with that feeling.
You will continue to get your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, during the next month's Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the terrorist attacks in Pulwama, there has been an intense feeling of sadness in the minds of the people of the country.
Condolences are being made to the martyred soldiers and their families.
The feelings of great sadness are in our hearts and in my hearts against such terrorist violence, the same feelings are in the hearts of every countrymen and humanity that believe in humanity and humanity all over the world.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our Armed Forces have always shown unique adventure and valour.
Where he has shown a wonderful potential to establish peace.
He has worked to give a positive answer to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how action has been taken within 100 hours.
The courage that the father of the martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar showed in such a tragic event is inspiring all of us.
We will send our second son to the army to fight against the enemy and we will fight ourselves, he added.
The whole country salutes the indomitable courage of the martyrs of Jagat Singhpur in Odisha, Shri Prasanth Sahu, the wife of Meenaji.
He has also decided to recruit one of his only children in the CRPF.
He said that when the martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in the tricolor in Gumla village in Jharkhand, his innocent son will also be recruited in the army.
The courage shown by these innocent children is the feeling of every young child in India today.
This feeling is visible from the houses and houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
No one of our brave martyrs is exceptional to their family exception.
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria or the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the son of the martyr Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of martyrs is inspiring.
We don't need to look at the ancient events of history to know what is sacrifice and penance.
These are moving examples in front of our eyes.
These are the examples of inspiration for India's bright future.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for the past several years.
Therefore, it is natural for the countrymen to have a curiosity and curiosity about it.
Shri Yut Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka on the Narendra Modi App, expressed happiness over the completion of the work of the National War Memorial.
This memorial is a place to preserve the story of the great bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to build a motivational memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National Military Memorial and the direct work was also started.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, this National Military Memorial will be handed over to millions of countrymen to our army.
The country will make a very small effort to facilitate the loans you have on.
This new memorial has been built near the India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti Bhag.
I am confident that the sacred work of visiting this National Soldier Memorial is in the vision of the countrymen.
It is a national military memorial that symbolizes the gratitude of the country for the supreme sacrifices made by the soldiers after independence.
The building of this memorial will showcase the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The theme of this National Military Memorial is based on four centre cycles, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
The flame of Amar Chakra is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrdom soldiers.
The protector chakra after this is reflecting security.
There are queues of dense trees in this cycle .
These trees are a symbol of soldiers and are giving a message to the citizens of the country that the soldiers are on the border and the people of the country are safe.
Anyone will come here to know about the bravery of these brave soldiers and then we will be able to get the information of those soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country.
Our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces are not really possible in terms of great and invaluable contribution in the development of the country.
I believe that all of you should express gratitude to the men and women police personnel who are constantly working for our security.
I hope you will definitely visit the National Sainik Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
This will inspire others to visit this sacred place and will also be eager to visit this sacred place.
This time when I was reading the reactions that I had received from you, I would be able to pay attention to the very remarkable reactions of Ashish Mukhopadhyay ji.
He wrote that on March 3, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
Both have come from different family backgrounds, but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
Paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat in a way to salute the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great landmarks have not only brightened the name of Jharkhand but the whole country.
The whole country is grateful for his contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can take the name of someone as a guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British took Birsa Munda while lying down completely hiding and showing a very chaturity and caught him.
Do you know why the British had to accept such a path of reluctance to catch Munda
Because these big empires were frightened by English Munda .
Lord Birsa Munda had only removed the British government, which was decorated with guns and guns with the help of his traditional bow.
In fact, if people get such an inspirational leadership, then the collective will power becomes stronger than the powers of the armed forces in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda not only fought with the British for political independence but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
He has done everything in his alphase.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited the light was brought like sun rays .
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the age of 25 years.
Like Birsa Munda, the son of Bharat Mata has been in every part of the country.
But unfortunately, the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If the personality like Lord Birsa Munda makes us realize the existence, then the personality like Jamshedji Tata created a big institution in the country.
Jamshedji Tata was supposed to be the hub of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
Not only this, he established several world class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Once Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekanand Ji had visited the ship during the visit of the United States, there were discussions on various subjects.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Sciences was laid by this discussion.
My dear countrymen, our country's former Prime Minister Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29 February.
You all know that this date comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, a simple and quiet personality, was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget for the most time in the Parliament in an independent India.
Morarji Desai led Indias skilled leadership during the difficult times when the country's democracy was in crisis.
Morarjibhai Desai humbled himself in the movement against the Emergency to protect democracy.
They had to calculate a huge price in old age.
The government of that time had hampered them and put them in the tunnel.
When Janta Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution will not be abrogated even during the period of emergency.
Morarji Bhai had amended this incident to repeat the way democracy was killed in the Emergency Lawn, 1975.
Today, once again, I pay my tributes to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, people were very excited about the Padma Awards.
In such a situation, we feel that those people who work with selflessness and dignity should be respected for their work.
Many people are making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways with extreme hard work.
Those people who are selfless in the service of the people, in the service of the people, in the service of the society and in the service of the nation, are Karmayogi.
This is a real worker and is far away from the world of fame, they do not know whether your names have come or not.
He believes in the work, and the message of Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam is in a way that he is accomplishing the Gita.
I would like to talk to you about some such people today.
Khatri is working to bring rare painters to the new generation.
Tree of Life, made by Abdul Gafur, I had given a visit to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of the Padma awards, Shabbir Said of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gomata .
The way he has dedicated his entire life to the service of Goddess Goddess Goddess, his work is different.
Despite the age of centuries, they are imparting Yoga training to many people in the world.
So far, he has made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers, and Jamuna Tudu, who is known as Lady Tarjan in Jharkhand, has worked hard to do two hands with Timber Mafia and drug addicts and saved 50 hectares from destruction of forests.
Because of the hard work of Jamuna Bai ji, the villagers of that area plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their household.
He has worked towards empowering women and how farming can be beneficial.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their region to become financially self-reliant by connecting with Self Help Groups.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of India that is changing in a way.
My dear countrymen, I have just come here with a heart-breaking experience that will tell you here today.
Today, wherever I go to the country, my effort is to meet some of the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PMJAY i. e.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I remember that this scheme has brought about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to get cashless pharmaceutical treatment, then all of us must inform him of this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations in schools will start now.
The tenth and twelfth examinations will be started in the next few weeks in different examination boards across the country.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the students and their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, in Delhi, a big programme like 'Exam Pe Church' was organised and it was like the Town Hall program.
The Pariksha Pe Discussion programme was a very pleasant interaction on various subjects related to examination.
This will benefit the students, he added.
All the students, their teachers and parents can see the full recording of this programme on YouTube and my best wishes to all the exam warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, discussions about India are going on and we cannot talk about festivals.
This is the reason why we have a thousand years old culture and tradition.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend some time with Divyang brothers and sisters during this visit to Kashi.
And it is a pleasant surprise to hear the copy of Nawal for me.
The way I speak in the Mann Ki Baat, I will duplicate the same methods.
I felt very fond of this thing that people just listen and leave Mann Ki Baat.
I was really impressed with the power of the disabled young man.
My dear countrymen, it is a wonderful experience for me to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Many times, while speaking to all of you, while reading the letters you have sent or listening to the ideas you have spoken on a telephone, I feel that all of you have considered me a member of your family.
This is a pleasant feeling for me.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, all of you are busy in the dharma of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
Respecting the strong democratic tradition, Mann Ki Baat will be the last Sunday of the month of May.
This means the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May.
After the election, with a new belief and with the strength of the blessings of all of us, I will once again start a programme to interact with you through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to talk to you for several years.
Once again I express my gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas should continue to follow his responsibility by working hard, that is, the residence of Lord Shivaji and stay in Kailash Dham.
His reputation was a scholar who had wonderful influences on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He guided his entire life to provide food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of the supremely respected Swamiji.
In 2007, our former President Dr.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the revered Swamiji.
This poem of In Giving, You Receive Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Your Actions Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life and mission of Siddhaganga Monastery in a beautiful manner.
Once again, I offer my respect to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our Republic - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
It is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission to see the large level of elections held in India and the skills that the Election Commission manages.
In our country, every citizen of India, who is a registered voter.
There is no stone unturned to ensure that there is a registered voter, he will get an opportunity to vote.
In Himachal Pradesh, the polling stations are being set up at a height of 15,000 feet from sea level, while voting is arranged on extremely remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Imagine, just for a voter.
It is natural to be proud of the Election Commission when I hear this thing.
This is the beauty of our democratic beauty that the Election Commission's staff should go to far-flung areas and arrange for voting in order to give them an opportunity to use their voter.
I appreciate the Election Commission, which has been striving to strengthen our democracy.
I would urge the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they must register as voters.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote.
We must realise this responsibility.
This should be our tendency, our tendency.
This should be our edition.
I urge the nominees of the country to make people aware by conducting a mission to get a voter registration or to vote for the people.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and our participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave people who contributed to the freedom struggle of India on Netaji's birth anniversary.
You know that many rooms and buildings were closed since independence in the Red Fort.
Closing rooms in the Red Fort are now a very beautiful museum, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
Yaad-e-Jallian and 1857 Atin Fitty Service, India's First War of Independents, have been dedicated to the nation, and this entire complex has been dedicated to the nation as Kranti Mandir.
Every brick of this museum has a fragrance of our glorious history.
Thai Thai inspires us to see the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle in the museum.
At this very place, the brave son of Bharat Mata, Colonel Prem Sahagal, Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillan and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had run the British Rajvatin Khat.
When I used to see the memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Temple, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap hat.
Netaji used to wear that hat.
I allowed the hat to be kept in the museum so that the people coming there should see that hat and inspire patriotism from it.
In fact, our heroes need to be bravery and patriotism in different forms to new generations.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
In a programme, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place where Netaji Subhash Bose had hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, all were surprised because there is a tradition of 15th August here.
This is the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as brave soldiers and skilled associations.
One such brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Let us go to Delhi, let me eat, I will give you freedom, by making many bright announcements, Netaji got a place in the minds of every Indian.
And I am glad that the files related to Netaji had been brought to everyone for several years.
I remember that day when all the family members of Netaji had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we discussed several issues related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that several places related to the great heroes of India have been developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir related to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that is Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you about the life of Netaji.
I have always considered an important medium for connecting with the radio people, as well as Netaji also had close relations with the radio and he also chose radio to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu started the Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers and people of the Azad Hind Fauj through radio.
Subhash Babu had a different style of commencement of his address on the radio.
At the beginning of his address, he used to say that as soon as Is Subhash Chandra Bose speaking to You Over the Azad Hind Radio, a new zeal and a new energy was transmitted to the audience.
I was told that these radio stations used to broadcast weekly news in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashtu and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by Gujarat resident M.
Vyas played a very important role.
The programmes broadcast by Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been set up in this Kranti Temple .
An attempt has been made to present Indian art and culture very attractive methods here.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 centuries old paintings and artworks.
The excellent art works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jemini Rai, Saloz Mukherjee are being performed in the museum.
And I would urge you all to visit Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that art discussions are going on here and I am telling you about seeing the best art works of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, we would have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on several subjects.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, he has also drawn several beautiful natural pictures and not only have he worked to bring many human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he has not given any names to most of his pictures.
He believed that those who see their paintings would understand the meaning of that painting, and the meaning of their message from paintings would be known from our perspective.
Their painting exhibitions have also been conducted in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope you will definitely visit Kranti temple to see their paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through our thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas ji used to give the greatest message from a little humble.
He used to say that in the species of Haizo Ketan, the patraidas of Haizo Ketan are not connected to the human beings, but if the bananas are not finished, then the leaves below the leaf, then the leaves below the leaf and the ultimate leaf are not finished, but the entire tree is finished, in the same way, the humans have been seen in different species and human beings are not there.
He used to say that if in reality God is in every person then it is not right to distribute it on a caste, creed and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour throughout his life through his message.
It will not be wrong to say here that he explained to the world the true meaning of labour's dignity.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov that I should highlight Indias space programme and its future aspects.
I would like to urge the students to take juice in the space programme and think about moving ahead from the sky and I appreciate this message, especially the message I have given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has contributed a significant role in Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to numerous young scientists of the country.
We are proud that today our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets.
This is the 24th January that our students have launched Kalam-Set.
Sounding rockets made by the students of the University in Odisha have installed several records.
The more space missions have been launched since independence in 2014, the more space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record to release 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon show India's presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technologies in a better way to protect live and property.
Whether it is a cyclonic storm, railways and road safety, space technologies are being helped.
Our fishermen brothers have been given navigation devices, which are also helpful in their safety and economic development.
We are using space technologies to facilitate delivery and responsibilities of government services.
Around 40 lakh houses have been geo-tagged in about 23 states under the Housing for All.
At the same time, under MNREGA, about three and a half crore assets have also been geo-tagged.
Our satellites today have become a symbol of the growing strength of the country.
Our excellent relations with many countries of the world are the same contributions.
South Asia Satellites have been a unique initiative, which has also offered development to our neighbouring countries.
Through its unbreakable competitive launch service, India today launches not only the developing countries but also the satellites of developed countries.
Skies and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space programme gives the children an opportunity to move forward by thinking differently and knowing the limits that were impossible till now.
We have a vision to inspire and explore new stars as well as the stars of our children.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those who play will open up and many young and young sportspersons have come out openly in Khelo India this year.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports events at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
When the sportsperson performs the best at the local level, he will perform the best globally.
This time, sportspersons from every state have performed well at their respective levels in Khelo India.
Life inspires many sportspersons who have won medals.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
Under the age of 21, the captain of the women grabbing team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi, is a resident of Satar, a very young man who was born and gave a boost to the skills of his brother and his brother Sonali.
It is often seen that girls do not get much encouragement in sports like kabddi.
Despite this, the golden grave chose and performed excellently.
Asansol's ten-year-old Innovation Shaw, Khelo India Youth Games wins the youngest gold medal.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, Akshata Baswani, won the gold medal in the weightlifting.
Their elders are farmers in Belgaum.
When we talk about building India, then a New India is the pledge of youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling us that not only big cities are contributing to the creation of a New India, but also the youth, children, young sports talents from small towns, villages and towns are contributing to the creation of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contents.
This is the name of a clean beautiful toilet.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, they are making paintings and making them beautiful, you will get to see the pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all the Sarpanchs and the heads of the village to lead this mission in our Panchayats.
Definitely put your clean beautiful toilets on Myljatghar and social media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we have started a journey to keep the country in mind together to free the country from clean and open defecation.
Today, India is moving forward in the direction of Open Defecation Long before 2nd October, 2019, with the help of everybody in India, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examination and examination warriors.
Ansul ji, thanks for this issue.
The first part of the year is the season of examinations for many fairs.
From the students, from their parents to the teachers, all the people are busy in the examination related work.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would certainly like to discuss in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, but you would be happy to hear that two days later, on 29th January, I will interact with students from all over the country with parents and teachers will also participate in this programme.
And students from abroad will also participate in the event.
I will surely put some of these ideas and information in the Town Hall programme.
Through social media and Namo App, we can also see the same lifestyle.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
You should also pay homage to your martyrdom for two minutes.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
The year 2018 will end.
And only then is the benefit of experience and self-confidence of selecting.
What can we do, which will transform our lives and contribute to the development of the society and the country.
My best wishes to all of you in 2019.
You must have decided to recall any memories of 2018.
It is also important that India will be remembered as a country in 2018 as a power of one hundred and thirty-three crore people.
And we all are also proud of the fertilizers.
The worlds largest Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance Scheme was launched in 2018.
Electricity reached every village in the country.
The prestigious institutions of the world recognized that India is working to eradicate poverty at a record pace.
With the unprecedented resolution of the countrymen, the coverage of cleanliness is moving forward to 95.

This year, India has won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has also performed well in the Para Asian Competition.
If I talk about our collective efforts for the men of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will emerge.
All this has been possible by the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, in December, we have faced some extraordinary Indians.
Dr. Jayendran died on 19th December in Chennai.
Dr. Jayendran is known as the most affordable treatment provider to the poor.
People say that he was ready for patient service.
com on this website, I have read a lot of articles about the motivation of his society.
Similarly, on 25th December, Sulagittenarasamma of Karnataka passed away.
In the beginning of this year, he was awarded Padmashree.
There are many people like Jaichandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the welfare of the society.
While you are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts being made by the doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors from the city are organising camps and giving free treatment to poor patients.
This kind of shirt is taken every month by the heart lung cricket care here and in these camps there is a facility of free treatment of many types of diseases .
Today every month hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors who are selflessly serving patients is really worth mentioning.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Madhya Pradesh had launched the cleanliness mission in Jabalpur.
I'm just the betterindia.
I am sure that this will bring more and more people to know about our heroes that transform the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good works are being done around us in the society.
And all this is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is a matter of importance in every society.
When sports are played, there is also energy in the minds of those who see them.
We see a lot of fame, identity and respect for the sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many such things that are bigger than the world of sports.
I will now tell you about the Nanaya Nisar, the daughter of Kashmir, who won the gold medal in the karate medal in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanaya taught and practiced Karata with hard work and bitterness and learned the barks of it and proved himself.
I pray to all the countrymen for their bright future.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the 16-year-old Rajni had a lot of discussion in the media about this girl.
Rajan said that his father has made a lot of sacrifice and hard work to reach here.
Jasmer Singh went to work every morning before Rajni and his emotions got up.
When Rajan expressed his desire to learn the fists, his father collected all possible means and enhanced his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to exercise fists because the financial condition of her family was very furious.
Despite all the obstacles, Rajni continued to learn the fists.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh Ji and Usha Rani for helping Rajni and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle has become the fastest Asian in the world.
It was driving about 300 kilometers of cycles everyday for 159 days.
You imagine 300 km cycling everyday
His responsibility for driving a bicycle is really worth mentioning.
Whether we are inspired by listening to such achievements or not.
Especially when my young friends hear about such incidents, they also get inspired to show them something by crossing the obstacles.
If you determine that if there is strength in the resolution then all the problems fall on their own.
No problem can be obstructed .
When we listen to such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, in January, there will be several festivals like Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi.
On the occasion of all these festivals, somewhere the color of traditional dance will be seen in the glorious country, somewhere the iron will be burnt in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day begins to grow gradually and the winter season of Sugi starts .
My best wishes to the farmer brothers who are our food donors.
Ekta Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is a spirit of our festivals in diversity.
We can see how much our festivals have become united with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not different, there is one individual and equality.
The best example of our close relations with nature is the calendar based on festivals.
In this there are festivals of the year, along with this there is also information about planets and constellations.
From this traditional calendar we get to know how old we have relations with natural and astronomical events .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the date of festivals is fixed according to the moon and the sun calendar .
It depends on the calendar that counts according to the calendar.
Festivals are also celebrated in many parts according to the condition of stars.
Gadhi Pandava, Chetichand, Ugadi are celebrated according to the lunar calendar, while Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh, Bihu are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Rivers and water conservation have special importance in many of our festivals.
The festival of Chhath is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
On Makar Sankranti also lakhs and crores of people bath in the sacred rivers .
Our festivals also teach us social girls.
On the one hand, they have ancient importance, on the other hand, every festival is easily inspired by social brotherhood.
I extend my best wishes to all of you in the 2019 and wish you a lot of happiness in the coming festivals.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can be proud of and can show pride to the world and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from all over the country come there and are always associated with the Kumbh Mela.
The Jansagar of faith and faith is in the Kumbh.
Millions of people from abroad have gathered in one place.
The tradition of Kumbh is accomplished and blossomed with its great cultural heritage.
From 15th January this year, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organised in Prayagraj, which perhaps you all are eagerly waiting for.
Saints and saints have already started reaching Prayagraj for Kumbh Mela.
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the list of unique cultural traditions of humanity, which can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of many countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At that time, the flags of several countries were hoisted at one time.
People from more than 150 countries are likely to come to Prayagraj.
With the divine divineity of Kumbh, India's grandeur will illuminate its colorful marks in the whole world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium to find itself and every person coming here feels different.
This is a great academic experience especially for the youth.
I myself had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the preparations for the Kumbh Mela are going on at a rapid pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, emphasis is also being laid on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
If the Kumbh event will focus on cleanliness along with cleanliness then its good message will reach far and wide.
This year, the devotees will also be able to visit Akshayavat after the holy bath at Triveni Sangam.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of the faith of the devotees, was closed in a fort for several years, so the devotees could not see it even though they were willing.
But now the doors of this Akshayavat fort have been opened for all.
I would urge you that when you visit the Kumbh, you will definitely upload some photographs on social media showing different aspects and colors of the Kumbh, and more and more people will be inspired to visit this Kumbh.
May this spiritual Kumbh become a Mahakumbh of philosophy for Indians in India.
May this Kumbh of art and creation be the Mahakumbh of powers.
My dear countrymen, the people of our country are very excited about the Republic Day celebrations of 26th January.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unprecedented relationship.
Mohan became Mahatma from South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly in opposition to separatism.
He also established Financies and Tolstoy Farms, from where the voice of peace and justice was raised in the whole world.
The year 2018 is also celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela, which is also known as Madiba.
We all believe that Nelson Mandela is considered to be an ideal in the fight against alphabetry all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to serving Turungawas for so many years from respected Bapu.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration for the entire world but also inspire us to build a society with love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit in Kevadia on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat where the highest statue of the world is Statue of Unity.
The detailed discussions were held on how steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the launch of the Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, which will be awarded to those who have contributed to national unity in any way.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been striving to maintain Indias integrity.
Sardar Patel believed that the real strength of India was united in diversity.
Respecting his feelings, we pay homage to him through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, 13th January is the sacred day of Guru Gobind Singh Jis birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, for a long time in his life, North India was his workplace and he sacrificed his last life in Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi North India and the last of life in Nanded.
In a similar way, the entire India has received his blessings.
If you look at their lives then you can see the reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of Father Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji obtained the post of Guru in an alphaus of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice as a heritage from the Guru.
His personality was calm and straightforward, but when he tried to smile the poor and the weak, when injustice took place on him, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak.
One hundred and a half lakh boys, birds, son-main-baj Turaun, then Govind Singh Nam Kahaun Tey used to say that it is not appropriate to showcase our strength by fighting against the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that removing the sufferings of human beings is the biggest service.
He was an excellent tricolor, along with Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country which are not discussed at a broader level.
Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority (IFSI) is implementing this.
I am working to promote safe and healthy habits of diet.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritious food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, F.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to him for this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this initiative.
I would like to say that you should also participate in this and especially the children should show these things.
It is important to get education which gives importance to diet from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last event in 2018 and we will meet again in the year 2019.
Life, be it individual or nation or society, inspiration is the foundation for the progress of that life.
Let us move ahead with new inspiration, new enthusiasm, new resolutions, new achievements and new heights, let us move forward, let us change ourselves and change the country.
On 3rd October, 2014, on the holy occasion of Vijayadashmi, we all started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
The same person was the driver.
There was no clothing on the dhaba.
On the sides of the road, he had made a very small tappy basket.
There was a discussion on the radio at that time.
This should be reached in the remotest parts of the country, from the villages of the entire corner to the metro cities, from the farmer brothers to the young professionals.
Recently, All India Radio has conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the implications received from that survey, some are very different, observative.
Of the people who have been surveyed, about 70 percent of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Many people feel that Mann Ki Baat has contributed immensely to a positive spirit in the society.
This is a reflection of the positive spirit of our countrymen.
Many people have also expressed their experience that Mann Ki Baat has enhanced the spirit of voluntaryism, voluntaryism and doing something ahead.
There has been a change that people are now coming forward with great enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that the popularity of radio is now increasing due to Mann Ki Baat.
But there is no single medium of radio in this journey.
Thank you very much for phone call ending
The doubt that you have expressed is absolutely right.
However, if a leader is given a mike to speak and lakhs and millions of listeners are there to listen to him then what else should be there
He studied what words were used repeatedly.
This study has concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started the Mann Ki Baat programme, I was sure that there is no politics in it, no government's readings and no Modi in it.
I have got all this inspiration from you and you have done a big job to achieve this resolution.
In the letters that came before every part of the Mann Ki Baat, what are the expectations of the audience from the online telephones
What will happen and what will happen to Modi but this country will remain immortal and our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore countrymen will continue to live.
Anybody from the remotest part of the country writes to me that people like us should not pay much to small shopkeepers, auto rickshaw drivers and vegetable sellers.
Now a mission like selfie with doter can be started in a small village of Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word.
Mann Ki Baat is a matter of aspirational India.
If you want to give a simple answer to the question we have asked, then you can say that nothing is being prepared.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
Because every time I get letters from the people before Mann Ki Baat.
By calling this number, people also record their messages in their voices.
Before every part of Mann Ki Baat, I try to save the maximum number of letters and comments.
And that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of that journalist and the feelings of that journalist become a part of my ideas.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
It is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all examples, emotions and inspiration are of my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat so far, but these people send their letters.
Efforts are made to ensure that all the letters and advice related to the letters that cannot get place in the Mann Ki Baat.
It is because of his hard work that Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of All India Radio prepares every part for broadcasting in different languages.
Some people take away the sounds of Modi and listen to Mann Ki Baat in regional languages spoken in style.
On one hand, he becomes Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their talent and skills they are showing.
I urge all of you to listen to this program in our local language too.
But many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat have also been raised by the media.
Cleanliness, road safety, narcotics-free India, Selfie with Dotter, etc. on these topics, the media has created innovative ideas and made it a campaign and worked a lot further in that field.
Without your cooperation, Mann Ki Baat will remain incomplete.
Sometimes our ancestors also stand in a big crisis in interaction.
Besides acceptance and reaction, I prefer to understand what the person in front of us is saying.
Communication Gaps are usually discussed between the elderly, the elderly and the younger children of the family.
In fact, most of the households are confined to discuss with young children and children.
It discusses the study of children or their habits and their present lifestyle for a long time .
I have always been striving for what they are doing or how these children think, whether they can learn something different from them.
In the end, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation has a desire to do many things at the same time.
I say, what's wrong in this
The same youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and dream big dreams and have brought about this change.
My dear countrymen, Vinita ji from Gurugram has written on MyGov that in the Mann Ki Baat tomorrow, on 26th November, I should talk about the Constitution Day.
He said that this day is very special because we have accepted the Constitution, it is now 69 years and we will enter the 70th year.
Imagine, within three years, these great personalities have created such a comprehensive and comprehensive event.
The way these great people have formulated a roadmap for such a rapid incident, this work is still an excellent example of the management and productivity of the past.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties i. e.
The synergy of these two is going to take the country forward in the lives of the citizens.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then our rights will be protected by ourselves and if we obey our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected by ourselves.
I still remember that when the Republic of India was 60 years old, in 2010, we had taken a glorious luxury journey in Gujarat with an elephant rule.
In order to create awareness among the youth about the Constitution and to know about the important aspects of the Constitution, our efforts to link them to the Constitution were memorable.
And let us ensure that there is peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever we talk about the Constitution Committee, we can never forget the contribution of the great man.
He was a great man, respected Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Maha Parinirvana Divas is on 6th December.
It is not a new thing for India that what is the Republic and what is the parliamentary system.
He said that this freedom we got after such a struggle is invaluable and we need to protect our blood to the last drop.
India First, Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, all of you celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and next year, that is, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought about the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have also been instructed to celebrate this program in a big way.
Similarly, the 550th light of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries around the world.
At that time I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, this guru had a great loss.
But the way the state government has worked with the help of the local people, it is still going to be an ideal.
An important decision has been taken by the Government of India to build Kartarpur corridor so that travellers of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur in Pakistan.
But our journey will continue in the same way.
The more people will be associated with you, our journey will be better and enjoyable.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of the people that what do I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the youngsters of the country are ready to run for unity every year.
I urge you all to participate in this race for a large number of unity.
About six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, photographs of Sardar Patel were published on the face of the world's famous international month Time Month which was published.
This was a map of India which was divided into several parts.
Then more than 550 institutions were in the country.
Though the juice of the British in India was over, they used to break the country in many parts and disintegrate and then leave the country.
The Time menstruations have written that India is facing threats like destruction, violence, food striking, inflation and politics of power.
The Time menstruations have written that in all these, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will have the ability to get the country into the thread of unity and fill the wounds.
This report of ' time ' menstruation was opening many other aspects of the life of iron man .
In the decade of 1920, how he made arrangements for rescue operations after the floods in Ahmedabad, how he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha.
He has merged all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad or Travankor or the ideological maturity and strategic skills of Rajasthan, we can see a single India today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on seeing this nation and our mother India built in the bond of unity.
We will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation while paying homage to Sardar Patel on the 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat, the height of this statue is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty statue in the United States.
This statue is the world's tallest skyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud that the world's tallest statue is on the Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the ground, will now enhance the glory of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the slaughter from the slaughterers.
This historic event has a direct link with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old story of India's great military officer Sam Manikshaw.
In his speech, Field Marshal Manikshaw reminded him of the time of the Colonel.
On 31st October, the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt.
I pay homage to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, Strongth, Skill, Stamina are very important in the world of sports.
The youngsters of the country who have these qualities will not only progress in areas such as economy, science and technology, but will also hoist their flags in sports.
Our Para Athletes, who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018, got the opportunity to meet.
In this event, India won a total of 72 medals and created a new record and enhanced Indias honour.
I was fortunate to meet all these talented Para Athletes personally and I congratulated them.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be happy to hear that in the Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have performed the best.
In this event, we won three more medals in Mix, besides 13 medals.
You must have remembered that Indias performance in the Asian Games this year has been better.
Look, while speaking for a few minutes, how many times I used the best and most glorious words so far.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is taking new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those areas which have never been considered.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who has won a gold medal for the country at the 2018 Asian Para Games.
He has been disabled since birth.
When he was eight years old, his father was born.
Then he took eight years in an orphanage.
After abandoning orphanageram, he worked as a waterwater in the DTC bus and the roads of Delhi.
Today, Narayan is winning Gold for India in the same Narayan International Competition.
Not only this, India has never won any Olympic medal at Judo at a senior or junior level.
But Tababi Devi won the silver medal in the Yuva Olympics and made history.
Tababi Devi is a 16-year-old young sportsperson from a village in Manipur.
Their elders are labourers and mother works to sell fish.
Many times it came to his family that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not come down.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his responsibility is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you have successfully organised the FIFA 17th World Cup in 2017.
The entire world appreciated the success of sports.
A new record was created in the number of audiences in the FIFA under Seventin World Cup .
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums in the country and enhanced the enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
This year, India has got the privilege to host the Men Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will start in November 2018 and will run till 16th December.
Whether every Indian plays a game or plays a game, he has a sense of intimacy towards Hockey.
India's history in Hockey has been written with gold.
Earlier, India has won gold medals in many events and once India has also been the World Cup winner.
India has also given hockey many great sportspersons.
When Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without this great sportsperson of India.
The magician of Hockey, Major Dhyan Chand, knows the whole world.
After that, Hockey has travelled from Balwinder Singh Sinior, Lesley Glodius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, Team India sportspersons are inspiring the new generation of Hockey by their hard work and dedication.
For sports lovers there is a good opportunity to see adventurous face .
Let him go to Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other associations.
During this time along with enjoying sports you can also see many world famous visiting and sacred places including the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Chilka Lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian Men Hockey team for this competition and assure that 1. 25 billion Indians stand with them for their support.
I extend my best wishes to all the teams of the world coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kind of people who are serving for social work are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new age, new generations, new hopes, new zeals and new dreams, we are moving forward to do this work.
A few days ago, I had visited a programme where a portal has been launched, its name is Self For Society, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country have started this portal to encourag their employees for social enterprises and provide them such opportunities.
Every Indian will be proud of the zeal and intimacy they have for this purpose.
IT to society, I am not me, I am not, I am not, I am not, I am, I am not, I am, I am not, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am,
Somebody learns children, somebody teaches senior citizens, somebody is engaged in cleanliness, somebody helps the farmers and there is no desire to do all this, but it is a self-reliant spirit of dedication and determination.
A young man himself learned wheel chair basketball to help the Divyang's wheel chair basketball team.
This feeling, dedication is a rapid initiative for special work.
Doesn't any Indian feel proud of this
My dear brothers and sisters, When I was watching the information about the people for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see an entertaining tip of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He wrote on MyGov, Please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the rituals and traditions of many tribes of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
How do we need to adopt their traditions for sustainable development and learn something from them.
Manish ji, I appreciate this theme for the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is the subject that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture, today all the world, especially the western countries, are discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for balanced lifestyle.
However, our India is not able to get rid of this problem, but to solve it, we only need to take a difference, to see our rich history, traditions and especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
It has been a part of our tribal culture to collaborate with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses .
In the Bhil tribal tribes of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh people worship with the faith of trees like Pipal and Arjun .
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Vishnoi society has shown us the path of environmental protection.
They are particularly supposed to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees, but they are not allowed to harm a single tree.
In Arunachal Pradesh, Mishmi claims to have a relationship with tigers.
They also consider them as brothers and sisters.
Tigers are seen as the protector of forests in Nagaland .
The people of the Varali community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as guests and the existence of tigers for them is prosperous.
It is believed in the Coal community of Central India that their fortunes are connected to the tiger, if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will have to stay hungry.
In the reproduction season of Gond tribal fish in central India fishing stops in some parts of Kethan river .
In the remote areas of Nilgiri Plains of South India, a small slaughtering community is broken, traditionally made up of goods available at local level.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that tribal communities insist on living together and peacefully, but if anyone is harming their natural resources then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighter was from the tribal community.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought strongly against the British government to protect his wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those people and institutions who have done some unique work for the society.
This kind of work looks irrelevant, but in reality, there is a great impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I used to read about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh in Punjab.
A common and hardworking farmer was married to Gurbachan Singh ji's son.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we will marry the daughter-in-law of the bride in a simple manner.
There is no need to spend too much on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this occasion in a simple manner.
But he said suddenly, but I have an impression.
Nowadays, when it comes to the topic of marriage, it seems that there is a big demand in front of the bride's family that will be difficult for the bride's family.
But you would be surprised to know that this was brother Gurbachan Singh who was a simple farmer, what he said, what he kept in front of the bridegroom's father is the true strength of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said that we will never burn Parli in our farms.
We can imagine how big social power is there in it.
But we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform the personal context into social interests.
Mr. Gurbachan Singh ji's family has put an example in front of us.
I have read another village in Punjab in Kallar Majra, which is near the navel.
Kallar Majra is a matter of discussion that instead of burning cereals, they mix it in soil and the technology that is required to be used for it is brought.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to all those who are making excellent efforts to keep the atmosphere clean.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle as a true heritage.
Like the drops and drops of oceans, small activism and awareness and positive work play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been said in our books: Daw: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Prithvi Shanti: Ap: Shanti: Medicine: Shanti: Vanaspatai: Shanti: Brahma Shanti: Vanaspatai: Shanti: Visvadeva: Shanti: Brahma Shanti: Shanti: Shantirav Shanti: Shantiridhi, Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Shanti: Santi..........
Establish peace in every corner of the world, in life, in my heart, in you, in every corner of the world.
Peace: Peace: Peace: Whenever there is a discussion of world peace, the name and contribution of India will be seen shining in golden letters.
11th November this year has a special significance for India as the first war ended on 11th November 100 years ago.
The event will complete 100 years, that is, the massive destruction that took place in that period and the loss of human beings will complete a century.
The First World War for India was an important event.
In fact, we didn't have to give anything directly to that war.
However, our soldiers fought with bravery and played a very big role and made supreme sacrifices.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there was a war, they were not less than anyone.
Our soldiers have shown valour in remote areas and in adverse situations.
The same objective was to re-establish peace.
In the First World War, the world saw all the destructions.
According to estimates, about one crore soldiers and the same civilians lost their lives.
This makes the world feel the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, the meaning of peace and harmony is not just war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, global cooperation and coordination need to be done.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the matter of our North-Eastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unique and the people here are extremely talented .
Our North-Eastern India is known for excellent work.
Northeast India is a region that has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award for 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
The award is given by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) associated with the United Nations.
You will be happy to hear that this award is with Oscar in the field of Best Policy.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award behind the 51 nominees of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October is over.
We are feeling that there is a huge change in the weather.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and take care of your society.
This festival is an opportunity to take new decisions.
This festival should go ahead in a mission mode and have an opportunity in our lives to make a solemn resolution.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more your progress will be, the more the progress will be made for the country.
