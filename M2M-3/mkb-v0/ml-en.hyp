Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, you are greeted.
Today is the holy day of Deepawali.
Nowadays, Deepawali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The feature of this festival is that not only the Indian community but also the governments and the citizens of the country and the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with joy and joy.
There is a microscopic world of India.
Friends, Tourism related to celebrations in the world has its own attraction for festival tourism.
In our country, every region has its own diversity celebrations and people from other countries are particularly interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we decided in the last Mann Ki Baat to do something different to this Diwali.
I had said, Let us all together, this time, on the occasion of Deepawali, we will celebrate the women's strength and its achievements, that is, we will respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately, innumerable stories of inspiring stories appeared in the society.
Written in the Worangal corpse on Namo App, my mother is my power.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took responsibility for five children.
Today we have five brothers in good work.
My greetings to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is acting in the film, says that she has a daughter of a bus conductor, who has led the Al-Wiman Division of Assam Rifles, Major Kushbu Kanwar Bharat Lakshmi.
Kavita Tiwari has her daughter Bharat Lakshmi and her own strength.
They are proud of their daughter being a good painter.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT examination.
On the other hand, Megha Jain writes about a 92-year-old man who has been supplying free drinking water at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Meghalaji, the humility and compassion of this Bharat Lakshmi is inspiring.
Many stories like this have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share things close to you...
The feeling of that poetry and the words of that poetry are now written in the seventeenth century.
What a great word, what a great emotional feature, what a good thought is in this poem in Kannada.
For the people of Pinnida Parmegond, Himavantan Pinnida Bhrigu Pinnida, Jasulidunu, that the hill king Himavan, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni, because of his daughter Lakshmi, the king of Janaka became famous because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
Our society has a strong personality and a bright future due to the greatness of these daughters.
Dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I can't forget what I went to the gurudwaras of Wankuver and Tehran.
I have a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will need several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stood firm on many evils like touch.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji gave his message to the world far away.
He was the most traveling person at that time.
He went to many places, everybody's heart was enjoyed by his humility, humility and behaviour like the common man.
The great religious journeys of Guru Nanak Dev Ji are called Udasi.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east and west, and saw people, saints and sages everywhere.
The well-known saint Shankardev of Assam is also considered to be inspired by him.
He also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya related to Buddhism.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has gone to Sri Lanka in South India.
During the journey to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had found solutions to the water problem there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During a journey like this, Guru Nanak ji had travelled in Kashmir and in the north India.
It has established a strong link between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and the people there considered him a guru.
He is also a worshipper in Uzbekistan.
He has also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He holds the minds of millions of people, according to his teachings, he is still following.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Delhi via Amritsar.
They visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which marked the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
These diplomatic delegates also got the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and also to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
After that, many Ambassadors shared their pictures in the social compositions and wrote about good experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you all will remember October 31.
That is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India, on the lines of unity in this country.
Sardar Patel had a surprising ability to unite the people and was also emotionally confronted with those who were disagreeed.
Sardar Patel had seen and learned every small thing in depth.
In fact, he was a personality of analysis.
At the same time, the organization's capabilities were also excellent.
He has achieved skills in preparing projects and improving war strategies.
When he reads and listens to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, he will know how deep his preparation was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Conference of Congress in Ahmedabad.
Patelji had the responsibility to make all the arrangements related to the MahaSammelan.
He used this opportunity to improve water supply in the city.
Nobody has any problem with water.
He asked the farmers to make Khadi bags.
The farmers made bags and sold them to the representatives.
The delegates needed the fear of stealing shoes because they kept shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, Khadi sales also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution in the Constituent Assembly.
He highlighted the importance of ensuring fundamental rights, so that there is no possibility of any difference between caste and caste.
Friends, We know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, as the first Home Minister of India, has made a pivotal endeavour to unite nations and to reduce history.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to note everything.
In 1947, after the partition of India, the eyes of our neighbours fell on Lakshadweep and they shipped there with the flag of that country.
As soon as we noticed this, Sardar Patel started taking strict action without spending a while.
He directed the brothers like Arkot, Ramaswamy, Arkot, Laxmanaswamy, etc. to take them from Tiruvankur to Lakshadweep and to raise the Tricolor Flag there, and to first fly the Tricolor Flag in Lakshadweep.
The tri-coloured flag flew soon and the neighbour of Lakshadweep's neighbour's dreams to capture the lakshadweep were defined.
After this incident, Sardar Patel and other brothers have been instructed to ensure that all assistance required for the development of Lakshadweep is available.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist place .
I hope you all will visit these beautiful islands and beaches.
Dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, I dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in the memory of Sardar Patel.
This is the tallest statue in the world.
To double the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
Every Indian is proud of the tallest statue in the world.
The head of every Indian rises proudly.
You will be happy that more than 26 lakh visitors have come to visit the Statue of Unity within a year.
I am confident that the people there have started dragon fruit farming, which will also become a major source of livelihood for the people there.
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a study for the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry.
We are witness to how a place has been developed as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
People from all over the country and abroad come there.
Several arrangements are being developed automatically after each other, including travel facilities, housing, guides, environment friendly arrangements.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, On the last day, the Time Magazine will be an Indian who is not proud to have given the Statue of Unity a great place in the world's largest 100 tourist destinations.
I hope you're all going to see the Statue of Unity with some time away from your precious time.
However, every Indian who finds time for traveling should go to at least 15 tourist destinations with family and my request to stay at night.
Friends, As you know, since 2014, we celebrate the National Unity Day every year on 31st October.
On this day, we send a message to save our country's unity, integrity and security at all costs.
On 31st October, the Forum is being organised every time.
This will be attended by people from all sections of the society and from all levels.
This is the symbol of the nation being the One, the For Unity is moving towards the same direction and wishes to achieve the same goal.
Likewise, there is a special interest and zeal among the people of Marathon.
The phone unit is also a beautiful opportunity for it.
Running is beneficial for mind and mind and body.
That's why not only the body, the mind and the unity of the cultural India, but also to bring India to new heights.
So, if you live in any city, you can find out where you're running for unity.
I hope you all will run for Indias unity and your fitness on 31st October.
Dear countrymen, Sardar Patel embraced the root of unity in the country.
Dear people, our society was always very active and aware to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look at ourselves, we can see many examples of continuous efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, sometimes the problems of the society, its contributions and memories are regular.
How many people of different kinds went to the plain.
All kinds of stakeholders were playing games to make their own achievements from the environment.
What kind of language is spoken to warm the atmosphere
Efforts have been made to spread turmoil in different voices.
We remember that some readers and some rhetoric have only spoken to make themselves important, what are neutral things.
He respected the upliftment of the court with great pride and did not allow the society to become a warming and pressure-enhancing environment.
These things have to be remembered forever, which makes us stronger.
Those days, those moments give us a sense of duty.
This is the example of the voice of unity and the power of the country.
It was a major blow to the country.
I pay my homage to the great man today.
My dear countrymen, if we hear a story from home to home, if we hear a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
It is inspired to tell every individual, every family and every village its own comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort for cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
125 crore Indians have the right to consequences.
But there's a pleasant and attractive impression.
I'm listening to you again.
The world's highest battlefield, temperature is 50-60 degrees minus.
Oxygen is the only place in the air.
It is a very adventurous thing to live in the midst of such challenges in the opposite environment.
In such a opposite environment, our brave soldiers not only keep our boundaries on the chest, but also conduct a programme called Swachh Siachen.
We know this Siachen is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness campaign here means clean water for those living in the valleys and they use water in rivers like Nubra, Shyok.
Dear people, the festival is an opportunity to awaken the spirit of all of us.
If Deepawali is in the family, especially buying something new and bringing something from the market is going on at least.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
We don't have to go to Taluk if we get the things we need in our village.
If you get to Taluk, you don't need to go to the district.
As much as we try to buy local goods, Gandhi will become a great opportunity for himself to become 150.
We have to buy anything that our khadi slaughterers shaped with the hands of our brethren.
I urge you to buy local things with the best wishes of Diwali.
Look, how important we can play in realizing the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes due to carelessness, there's a fire.
There may be blisters.
I urge you all to control yourself, celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2018
There will be no Indian who does not feel proud of our armed forces and the soldiers of our army.
Every Indian will always be enthusiastic to express his happiness and support to our soldiers, whether in any region or in any caste or community or in any language.
Yesterday, hundred and fifty five crore people of India celebrated the day of our army's valour with pride.
We reminded the Surgical Strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers replied to many of our nation in their faces to those who demonstrated that it was a terrible war on the other side of terrorism.
Our military exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country with the idea of more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation knowing what our strengths are.
How capable we are and how our soldiers save their lives and save their lives.
On the day of Parakram Parvat, the youth reminds of the pride of our armed forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who are trying to avoid the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India is always committed and dedicated to peace.
In the twentieth century, in the two world wars, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed great sacrifices for peace.
Remember that it was a time when we had no connection with that war.
It was a brave valour of our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the most armed forces in various peacekeeping forces of the United Nations.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmet.
My dear people, things in the sky are different.
On 8th October, we celebrate the Air Force Day.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those who serve the nation and to their families.
When the invaders from Pakistan started a sudden attack in 1947, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and war equipment reach the warground at the right time to save Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force responded to the enemy in 1965.
No one knows about Bangladesh's freedom struggle in 1971.
In 1999, the role of the Air Force was sustainable in relieving Kargil from the grip of crossings.
At Tiger Hill, the Air Force carried out a bomb attack on the enemy's camps and destroyed them.
I am grateful to the IAF for the commendable work done by our Air Force personnel, be it rescue operations or rescue operations during accidents.
India can proudly say that not only in the armed forces, but also in the women's power, the same contribution is made in the armed forces.
How to save Tommy all over the country.
You know Abilash Tommy is a very brave hero.
He is the first Indian to run the world with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
Over the last 80 days, he was on his journey on the ocean to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible seashore caused him an accident.
But this hero of the Indian Navy has been fighting in the sea for several days.
He lived in the middle of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
I didn't agree to defeat life.
I spoke on telephone when I saved aspiration from the sea, a wonderful example full of courage, determination and valour.
His courage, valour, determination and strength to overcome and win the disaster will certainly be inspired by the younger generation of our country.
Dear people, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
This year is an important significance on 2nd October.
For two years from now on, we are going to celebrate various events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the whole world.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle was strengthened, he revived those thoughts and prepared a new edition.
His thoughts have been placed in front of the people about the rights of the venerable Bapu farmers, villages and labourers, and many issues like cleanliness and education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Puja Baba was a public organizer.
Dad's speciality was to join people and join them, this was his nature.
This is an experience for everyone as the most important feature of his personality.
He has convinced every individual that person is the most important and essential for the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he made it a mass movement.
As per Mahatma Gandhi's request for the freedom struggle, people from all walks and sections of the society dedicated themselves.
In that Gandhiji says, I'm giving you a mantra.
And you feel that you're not skeptical, you're skeptical.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, we have to think of one thing on the basis of the growing middle class in the country, their increasing economic strength and growing purchase capacity.
When we go to buy something, can we remember the venerable Bapu for a moment
Can you remember that mantra of the sacred father
Can you imagine which citizen of the country will be able to achieve the benefits of the goods I buy
Whose face will be happy
Who can benefit directly or indirectly by buying it
If the poorest of the poor benefits, I will be more happy.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I am confident that a small step will make a big change in the lives of the poorest and weakest person.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that if he cleansed the premises, he would not even know how it was.
But that happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, in my country's economic growth, in economic empowerment, in the fight against poverty, we feel that there is a great contribution from us.
But I believe that it would be the real patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to keep the old and torn clothes of Khadi, because somebody's hard work was hidden in it.
He used to say that all these khadi clothes are very hard-worked and they should be used in every specimen.
This feeling of tea for the country and love for the people of the country was filled with every corner of the small and lengthy great man.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with Puja Baba.
As soon as the name of Scientists comes, the Indians will shine a lot of respect in our minds.
His compassionate personality is always proud of the people.
Besides, he looks very humble, but he had a strong personality like a mountain inside, the specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
His Jai Jawan Jai Kisan symbolises his strange personality.
In a reflection of his selfless penance to the nation, he gave the mantra to the youngsters and farmers of the country to reach the peak of victory over the narrow rule of nearly one and a half years.
People from all over the country are associated with this hard work of the fifteenth day.
Even those who worked with cleanliness did not have such a heartbreaking thing to be taken care of if they didn't have a phone related to this subject, even if you didn't have a big deal of facilities after the toilet was built.
I want to thank you for phone calling.
The closing ceremony of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be held on 2nd October, 2018 with the beginning of the centenary celebrations of Baba.
Dear people, there is a written in Sanskrit: "Nyayamalam Swarajya Syath".
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, various provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1993.
A few days later, the Commission will complete its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission not only protected human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
Our favourite writer, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Prime Minister of our country, said that human rights is not a unique vision for us.
During this 25-year visit, this institution has created an atmosphere of ideas and faith among the people.
I think this is a very comfortable event for a healthy society and for the best democratic values.
Today, human rights commissions have been set up in 26 States along with national level human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand human rights and bring it into action, this is the basis of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Dear countrymen, while the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan is coming in October, you cannot remember that Rajmata Vijayaraj is starting the birth centenary year of Scindia.
These great personalities are very inspired by us and bow down to them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb in detail in the next Manki Baat, but for a few years, on 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organized in all small and big cities, villages and streets of India.
This year, we have to organise an Ernforce Unit in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
The race for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the whole country.
Our efforts should be made to ensure that all sections of the society and every part of the country be united through the Autonomous For Unity Programme on 31st October.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat 2018 August
Today, the country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the people on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan is believed to be a symbol of love and faith of brothers and sisters.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are many stories incorporated in the pattern of faith in the people of two different countries and religions.
Within a few days, Janmashtami is being celebrated.
Congratulations to all the people on Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima.
I congratulate all those who are associated with this great heritage and bringing it to the common man.
We are proud that Tamil Nadu is the most ancient language in the world, and since Vedic times, cultural language has played a major role in the promotion of knowledge.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still speaking in cultural languages.
That's why any subtle description of a subtle emotion or subject can be explained properly.
At the same time, it is easier to understand that it is connected to our soil and our tradition.
For example, the importance of the Guru in life is to be understood - the disciple of Ekampi Akmasthu Guru, Pragadhyayethavya, Nasti Tad-dravaya, Yad-Datwahyanarini Bhavet.
The name of Radhakrishna is known as Sarvapathi.
His birth anniversary is celebrated throughout the country as Teachers Day.
I extend my best wishes to all teachers of the country on Teachers Day.
I also appreciate your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, the years come with new hopes for our farmers who work hard.
Rainfall provides relief to trees, trees and dry reservoirs sprinkling in severe heat.
But sometimes there's a great and devastating flood.
Nature has come to a situation where it rains more than it drives somewhere.
We have seen that the terrible floods in Kerala are very seriously affected by peoples lives.
Today, in this difficult situation, the whole country is with Kerala.
We feel compassionate to those who lost their own.
Though one hundred twenty-five crore Indians cannot solve the lost lives, they want to ensure that the unhappy families stand shoulder to shoulder with your shoulders on this occasion of grief.
I pray that the injured recover at the earliest.
I am confident that Kerala will rise due to the zeal and courage of the people.
Unfortunately, the damages that are left out of the accidents.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity in danger.
Wherever the accident occurs, whether in Kerala or in any other state of Hindustan, in the district or region, everyone from Kachh to Kamrup and Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something on their own.
Every age and every workforce play their own role.
Everyone is ensuring their role in smoothening the sufferings of the people of Kerala and sharing their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried the best to save the flooded people.
Dear people, this time Mann Ki Baat was being examined.
The subject written by more and more people across the country was our beloved, Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Gaziaabad, Swati from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Katihar from Katihar in Bihar and Eklesh Pandey urges people to write on various steps in Atal ji's life by writing on Narendra Modi Mobile App and My Giovi
It is sad that the country and the world heard Atal ji's death on 16th August.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister was the leader of the nation.
In a way, for the last 10 years, he had gone away from active politics.
There was no place in the news, not in public life.
The gap of 10 years was very big, but after 16th August, the country and the world saw that the ten-year period in the minds of ordinary people of India did not make a minute gap.
Whatever love and respect was with Atal ji, the sorrow that the whole country has spread, it shows his vast personality.
India will always be obliged to Atal ji in the name of the first Constitution Amendment of 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed to 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the Prevention of Currency Act has been reduced to one-third to three-thirds.
In addition, clear instructions have been made to disqualize those who change the party.
Over the years, a political culture that has been formed in India, has not been divided by the departments, but to joy the political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
This step of his career is for money and resources.
Besides, more efficiency.
This change has led to a long vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atalji was a native devotee.
During his reign, the time of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5 pm after following the British tradition, because it was the time when Parliament started in England.
During the presentation of Atal ji Budget in 2001, the time of presenting the budget has changed from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more independence - during the reign of Atal ji, the Indian Flag Code was created and gave it authority in 2002.
The Departments have added that the National Flag can be hoisted in public places.
It's a good thing, it's a good news for democracy.
It will be a good tribute to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, for a good democracy, for a good habit, for a continuous effort to strengthen democracy, for taking forward discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his commitment to fulfill his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay homage to Atal ji for all.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament ended.
You will be happy to note that in this conference, the productivity of the Lok Sabha is 118 percent of the Rajya Sabha's 74 percent.
The Lok Sabha has passed 21 Bills and Rajya Sabha 14 Bills as a result of the party's efforts to make the Monsoon Session effective.
This annual session of Parliament will always be remembered as a social justice and a convention that has been implemented by the youth.
During this conference, the great bills that benefit the youth and the backward communities have been passed.
For several decades, there was a need for setting up of OBC Commissions like the Scheduled Tribes Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has succeeded in forming the OBC Commission this time and has given it constitutional authority.
This step will become one of the goals of social justice.
The Amendment Bill was also introduced in the Conference to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the good of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
It will also prevent criminals from committing crimes and will fill confidence in the communities.
There is no unjust and cultural society against women's power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the criminals who have been killed.
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill and has ensured that the Department of Strengthened Penal Code (DoTP) is ensuring stricter education.
You might have read in the newspaper a few days ago that the person who has been killed in adult child has been sentenced to death in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh in a two-month trial.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial for five days and sentenced the culprits to death.
The court of Rajasthan has taken such a very quick decision.
The Act will play a good role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
I would like to assure the Muslim women that the whole country stands firmly for justice to them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the parliamentarians of the country on this occasion.
My dear countrymen, the attention of crores of people is now focused on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, people are searching for medals in newspapers, televisions and news in social media, which Indian sportsperson has won.
Asian games are still going on.
Congratulations to all the medal winners for the country.
Our girls have a lot of names among those who have won medals for the country, this is a positive sign.
The young sportspersons who won the medal are 15-16 years old.
It is a good indication that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages, who have achieved this victory through hard work.
I once again wish the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons a good show.
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day.
I respect the thoughts of the child.
We all have seen the construction of houses and houses with stones and rocks, but can you imagine the construction of an excellent, enormous and amazing temple of a mountain, which was a single rock about 1200 years ago
However, the Brihadeshwar Temple in Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable coordination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Anybody will be surprised by the ueen Ki Wave, built in the 11th century at Pan in Gujarat.
India's land was an engineering laboratory.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
On that part of the country, he is a puja, and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and self-confidence.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have shown their distinct personality throughout the world.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we have to think about the future.
We have to do workshops there.
Disaster Management has become a big deal recently.
The world is facing natural evils.
In this situation, what kind of structural engineering should be
How can we decide the priority in making waste free
We have to think of many such things when we celebrate Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
Due to India's geography and diversity, sometimes rain and preferences are shown.
But why are we blaming the rain
V.
Twelve kids of football sportspersons in Thailand took their coaches to the cave during their departure.
It'll take a few hours to enter the cave and get out there.
Because they couldn't find any other way, they took shelter on a small rock inside the cave - that's not one or two days, ten days.
If the children see death in front of them, you can imagine how these moments will happen when they have to live directly every moment.
On the one hand, they were straightforwards, on the other hand, the human values of the world were united together.
People all over the world were praying for the safe release of these children.
But when good news came to the end, it was comfortable for the world.
But I think I see this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission as a team.
I think it's a matter of learning and understanding everybody's restraint.
In this initiative, a naval personnel of Thailand had to sacrifice their lives.
It is surprising to the world that despite such a difficult environment, they have not been able to expect in a dark cave with such courage and forgiveness.
It sees miracles happen when humanity meets together.
The echo of hope, faith, determination and confidence was the specialty of the poems of Neeraj ji.
We have told the Indians that Niraj ji is one of the most powerful and inspirational ones.
It must be dark.
I pay homage to Shri Neeraj Ji.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is true.
I have won admission as a first year student at Delhi University this year.
During our school board exams, you talked about the tension and education of the exams and what is your message to the students like me
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
Because it's the peak season of colleges.
This is the time when millions of youngsters like truth come down from school to college.
In February and March, the exam papers and answers will be the time for April-May to play holidays and then wait for a result, to decide and choose a leading direction in life.
Children reach the shadow of professionals from the shadow of parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy since the beginning of their life.
For the first time, he went out of the house, went out of the village and got out of a safe environment and had to be regulated.
For the first time, many youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to life.
Many students might have joined their colleges and some would be ready to join.
I have to tell you to be calm, to enjoy life, to enjoy the soul in life.
There is no other way than books, we need to learn, but we have a habit of finding new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
Children's friends are unmatched, but it is a matter of consciousness to find and build new friends.
Learn something new, learn new skills, learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the winter season, a student from a poor family in Madhya Pradesh was watching the news of how Ashram Chaudhary won a success by surviving the challenges faced by life.
There are so many students who are from the poor family and from the challenging environment, who have done inspiring things with their own dedication and dedication.
Father is the driver of DDC, Prince Kumar in Delhi, Abhay Gupta, who was studying under the street light in Footpath, Kolkata and Afreen Sheikh, daughter of Afreen Shaikh, father of Auto Richha driver Ahmedabad, and daughter Khushi in Nagpur, a school bus driver, and Kartik in Haryana, a father's guardian and father's father's father's brother Saheb, who worked in his bricks.
If we look at the environment, we can see many such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country inspires my mind.
I was once interacting with Indian youth in Sanjoz City, known as the Technology Hub in America.
I told them how they can use their capabilities for India and do something from time to time.
I appealed to make brain drain into brain gene.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahuji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have made a different effort by accepting this challenge.
With their professional skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have prepared a Smart Gaw App.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world, but also makes them aware of any information and knowledge on their own mobile.
The villagers of Taudhpur village in Rae Bareli, the Prime Minister of the village, the District Magistrate and the CDO, inspired people to use this app.
This App is in a way a digital revolution in the village and it is easier to record, track and monitor all development works in the village.
The App has phone directory, news section, events list, health centres and information centres in the village.
This app is also very beneficial for the farmers and the rural feature of the app, and the factor rate between the farmers in a way benefits as a market for their produce.
If you look at this event, you will see that the young man living in America, living in his lifestyle and thoughts, leaving India several years ago, but he knows from the corners of his village, understands the challenges and feels emotional relations with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes due to distance, sometimes due to environment, a thin layer of skin covers it, but if a small canal touches it, it appears once more, it takes it to the past.
"Santoshji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Of course, Pampur Vari is a very amazing pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is being celebrated this time on July 23.
Pampur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before ASHA Ekadashi, i. e.
Millions of newsmen are participating in this journey known as Vari.
Pilgrims reach there for the darshan of Lord Vithal and Vithoba, called Vithoba and Panduranga.
God is good for the poor, the deprived and the oppressed.
People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
Going to the Vidhoba temple in Pampur and its magnificence, beauty and spiritual enjoyment is a different experience.
If I get the opportunity to tell the audience of Manki Baat, I must participate in the Parpur Valley once.
The people of Maharashtra are still aware of the innumerable pilgrimages like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram.
It is powerful to fight against blind dignity and this monk tradition will continue to inspire every corner of Hindustan.
It is a message of harmony, love and brotherhood from all the practices related to it.
There is a mantra of fighting society with respect to blind dignity.
The worldman was a personality full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and wisdom of the British rulers to demonstrate their mistakes.
The Englishmen were afraid of him to try to seduce treason three times in 20 years.
It's not a small thing.
I would like to present a funny event related to Lokmanya Tilakan and his statue in Ahmedabad before you.
When we reached Ahmedabad in October 1916, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him about a hundred years ago, during this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel got the opportunity to talk to him.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was influenced by Lokmanya Tilak.
Naturally, the British were dissatisfied with this, and the collector continued to allow it.
However, Sardar Saheb was Sardar Saheb, who was firm and firm, who had to leave his position, would have established the statue of the Supreme Court.
Finally, the statue was built and it was inaugurated on 28th February, 1929 by Mahatma Gandhi.
Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the World Justice.
Ganesh Festival was celebrated with traditional honour and festivals and became a strong medium of social awakening, social awareness, harmony and equality among the people.
It was a time to unite to fight the British in the country.
Out of this, our ancient heritage and our heroes of history are still interested in our younger generation.
Today, in many cities and all the streets, you will see Ganesh shrines.
This is a good opportunity for our youngsters to learn about leadership, organisational awareness and develop their capabilities.
This time, from the idol of Ganesh ji, all the decoration materials should be environment friendly and every city should have a competition for environment friendly Ganesh festival.
I'll surely bring these things to the people.
The world mandate has made confidence among the people, making a seal, self-reliance is our right to be born and it will be achieved.
It is time to say that even today, Swaraj is our right to be born.
Every Indian should have good results of governance and development.
This is the construction of a New India.
On the same day, after 50 years of the birth of Tilak, another son of Bharatamba was born on 23rd July.
He sacrificed his life as we breathe the wind of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are many youngsters like Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Ab Hamare Dil Mai Haidekhana Hai Jor Kitna, Baju-e-Kat, Mem Hai lines like Asfak Unah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his zeal for freedom have inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived, but never bowed to foreign rule.
A few days ago, the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championship held in Finland has created history by winning the Gold Medal of Indias brave lady and farmer daughter Hima Das in the 400m race.
In response to my letter to the fear of unity, my other daughter told me that the preparations for the Asian Games are going on from Indonesia.
In the e-mail, unity writes: I am proud that the most important moment in the life of any athlete is the tri-color flag which I have achieved.
"Oneness, we're all proud of it.
The name of unity was brightened.
In Tunisia, the World Para Athletic Grand Pre 2018 won Ekta Gold and Bronze medals.
I bow down to the fear of unity and Yogish Kutiyya and Sundar Singh for your courage.
My best wishes to all of you for the centuries of celebrations in this August, which has been patriotic and patriotic monument to live well for all of you.
Once again, I'll be in Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, there was a cricket match in Bangalore.
You can clearly understand that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
The two teams performed well in this game.
Bouler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan showcased the exhibition of IPL this year.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their capabilities.
Rashid Khan is representing a big player in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done one of the best ideals in the world.
During the purchase of Indian team trophy, for the first time, the Afghan team participated in the International Competition was called together and took photographs.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am confident that we will also participate in sports with a similar sportsman spirit.
Dear countrymen, the fourth Yoga Day on June 21 presented a different view.
To see the whole world happening.
At the high snow laden peak in Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly practiced yoga.
Yoga is the task of breaking all the borders and uniting the people.
Thousands of enthusiastic people in more than 100 countries have made this occasion a big festival without caste, religion, region, colour, men and women.
It is natural that people from all over the world have participated in the Yoga Day programmes with such enthusiasm.
It is a matter of pride for the country that hundred twenty five crore people have practiced Yoga in the security forces of our country and in the water-car-skies.
Some of the brave soldiers performed yoga at the intervals and some practiced yoga on snow laden mountains in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force exercised Yoga at a height of 10,000 feet above the ground in the middle of the sky.
They did swimming in the sky and not in the plane.
Yoga was conducted in schools, colleges, offices, gardens, high buildings and sports.
Yoga has united people from all over the world across castes, religions and regions and we have believed in the Vasudhaiva family for centuries.
Our sages, sages and other sacred sages are focusing on any subject that Yoga has actually shown it in its midst.
More and more people will make it part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, some people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell me about Dr.
It's okay.
Remember the doctor only when we get a problem.
But this is a day when our doctors have achieved the achievements, this is an opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society on this occasion.
The role of the doctor is not only in treating the disease.
He said, "They do not only change the treatment but also make the healthy today, the doctor has a medical speciality, and they have a great experience about how it affects our lives.
With their capabilities and skills, Indian doctors have shown their personal impressions all over the world.
Heads of the medical sector are also known as hard work and addressing the problems related to miserable treatment.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to our doctors friends on the occasion of Dr.
Dear people, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a prosperous history like a month or a day without any historical event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
I'm coming to Magahar on the twenty-eighth day.
Do you know why he went to Magahar
There was a belief that those who died in Magahar would not have heaven.
On the contrary, those who die in Kashi will have heaven.
Magahar was considered foolish, but Saint Kabir didn't believe it.
They are the same inspirational sources in today's era.
That is, the true spiritual saint knows and understands the pain of others.
The man who doesn't know the pain of the others is stupid.
At that time there was an unprecedented and conflict in the world and he conveyed the message of peace and harmony.
Together with the minds of the world, he worked to remove the differences.
His words are true even after centuries.
Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev is also a guru.
He has guided millions of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society and see humanity as a whole, to change them.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, "Bhagwad Seva is serving the poor and the poor."
In 2019, the 500th Light Mountain of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated.
I would like all of us to participate in it with zeal and zeal.
I urge you all to think of new ideas, new suggestions, new ideas and new ideas about how Guru Nanak Dev's 150th light festival is celebrated in the society and all over the world, to make preparations and to observe the light festival with great importance.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific event that embarrassed humanity in Jallianwala Bagh has lasted hundred years in 2019.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and Dr.
Shyamprasad is the birth anniversary of Mukherjee.
I have written to the people on this occasion about Shyamprasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji for the first time thank you very much.
Dr.
Accepting the invitation of Shyamprasad Mukherjee in 1937, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation in Bengali Language at Calcutta University.
When the British rule came to power, it was the first time that anybody at the Calcutta University spoke in Bengali language in a convention.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid a strong foundation for India and industrial development and built a strong foundation and a strong platform.
In the first industrial policy of India announced in 1948, his ideas and visions have been marked.
He had a dream that India should be professionally independent in every field and be skilled and prosperous.
He wanted SMEs to take care of handicrafts, clothing and hut industry.
The All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi-Vilage Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950 to provide financial assistance and institutional mechanism for proper development of housing and small industries.
Indias defence manufacturing should also be enhanced by Dr.
Shyamprasad Mukherjee was the most important thing for India's integrity and for that he had to sacrifice his life at the age of only 50.
Come on.
People talked about their imaginations, happiness and their achievements.
In far-flung villages, girls are providing services from pension to passports to the elderly in the village through Public Service Centres.
An ice cream manufacturing industry is being carried out by a sister in Chhattisgarh.
Like Ajan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters in the country are providing medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was looking for jobs two-three years ago, and today a business has been successful.
Not only this, ten and five are also employed.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste processing at the Tinkering Lab in the school at their young age.
There are some in the society, without speaking disappointing things, without speaking of failures, without trying to make unbelief, without finding ways to break the way to unite.
In such an environment, when common man arrives with ideas and new zeal and events in his life, it is not the best of the government.
Even the incident of a small child in such a small village can be inspired by hundred and fifty five crore people.
When I spent time with the beneficiaries through video bridge with the help of technology, it would have been comfortable and inspired to do something.
A new joy and new zeal is being inspired to provide life to the poorest of the poor.
I am very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can feel the fragrance of good.
I noticed something last day, it's a very different experience.
He has successfully worked with the farmers, projects and worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers.
In a way, the farmers have a major role in the entire network from crop production to marketing, and are trying to ensure double profits by ensuring the role of farmers and seeds to improve the crops.
Sowing bank has been built for that.
Women take care of this seed bank, and women are also connected to it.
I don't know anything, some don't know, some don't know, some don't know, but millions of people do some good things continuously.
Dear people, it is going to be a year in the middle of GST.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, today is really transformed.
People from different political ideologies are sitting there, people from different states are sitting and people from different priorities, but the decisions taken so far in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
Prior to GST, there were several types of taxes in the country, according to this arrangement, only one kind of tax is available throughout the country.
GST is the victory of honesty and this is the festival of honesty.
Earlier, there was a complaint of Inspector Raj regarding tax in the country.
In GST, IT and Information Technology have been replaced by an Inspector.
Everything from Return to Refund is being run online through IT.
GST was perhaps the biggest tax reform programme in the world.
Such a huge tax reform in India has been initiated because it has been adopted by the people of the country to ensure the success of GST through Jan Shakti.
It was usually thought that such a big reform was going to take 5-7 years to achieve full success in such a big country and such a large population.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Hello.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - Yes, I want to tell them something.
These six daughters of India, their team, have returned to India on 21st May, after travelling around the world on an INSV terrain over two hundred and fifty days in the sea.
The entire country welcomed them with enthusiasm.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their travellets.
Once again, I once again congratulate the world for enhancing the courage of those daughters and enhancing the strength of the Navy, especially the Indian daughters, for enhancing the dignity of India.
Who doesn't want bravery.
If we take care of the development of humanity, we will see progress from the womb of adventure.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On 16th May, 5 tribal children from an Ashram School in Maharashtra, Manisha Dhrure, Pramesh Ale, Umanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam climbed to the highest peak in the world.
The students of Ashram School started training on August 2017 and trained at Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Machin Shaurya.
They won Everest as a name and made the country proud.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all those associated with Chandrapur School, to these small children.
Sixteen-year-old Shivangi Pathak was the youngest Indian girl who won Everest from Nepal.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all those brave brave brave men, especially to the daughters.
They are tagging each other and challenging them.
Everyone is involved in this fit India movement.
The film industry and sports stakeholders, the common man of the country, the soldiers of the army and the teachers of the school participated in the event and listened to it all around.
If we fit, India and fit...
Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team has challenged me too, and I have accepted his challenge, this is a good thing.
Such a challenge will encourage us to fit and fit others.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard often about sports, sportspersons and something I say.
Last time, the heroes of the Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme.
"Chavi Yadavji, thank you for calling on the phone.
It is true that the games that were part of the lives of all the children who had played earlier in every street are decreasing today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes in the night, sometimes after dinner, children used to play for hours.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these sports.
The same game is known in different names at different places.
I am from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as 'Chomal-Isto'.
It's used by a square square board of 8:8 size, or a sword, or a square square square.
This game was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called 'Chaukabara' in Madhya Pradesh and 'Padkuli' in Kerala, 'Champal' in Maharashtra,' and 'Thayam Games' in Tamil Nadu and 'Thayam Games' in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you know, people from all over the country don't know the language, huh,
This game will tell us we're also playing.
Those who don't play childhood and cool will be.
Children are playing games in villages and cities.
It has been called by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Billa.
In Odisha, Gulibadi is called Vitidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own weather, season.
Like the city's flying season.
When everybody flies the city, everybody plays and shows the different qualities of us without any fat.
The elders look serious, but when they play, the child who hides them comes out.
Traditional sports encouraging our rational thinking, concentration, awareness and swiftness along with physical ability.
At the same time, we also know our culture and heritage.
Many sports make us aware of the society and the environment.
By calling people, we can create a great historical collection of our traditional games.
This time theme is to eliminate plastic waste - Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to understand the spirit of this theme, not using polythene, low quality plastic, to reduce the impact on the nature of plastic waste, on wildlife and on our health.
On the website of World Environment Day Wed-India 2018, see, know and try to implement many suggestions in a very attractive manner.
When it is hot, when it doesn't end the rain, when it becomes unbearable cold, everyone starts speaking like specialists Global Waming, Climate Changeing.
But what's the matter with me
All this is basically climate change, as a result.
Our culture and our traditions taught us not to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had argued for this in every step and in every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a key role in the CoP21 Paris Agreement and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How can we move on this matter
What can you do new
It's rainy season.
There are reports that the world is preparing to celebrate International Yoga Day on 21st June.
The world has again understood Yoga for Unity for Unity for the past few years.
Yoga always has the courage to protect us like our father.
If all these qualities are friends, then Yogi succeeds in all kinds of fears.
I once again urge all the people to promote our heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, well-being and well-being nation.
Dear countrymen, today is 27th May, the memory of Indias first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Prayers to Panditji...
The memories of this month are linked to another person.
In the month of May 1957, Indians showcased their strength to the British.
Veera Savarkar wrote that it was not a shame in 1857, but the first struggle for independence was not alarming.
Savarkar's life was full of features.
But after that he was a great poet and social reformer, he always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee has described a very good description of Savarkarji.
Savarkar took poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and adventure revolutionary.
If you have the desire to do something then you can succeed in all the resistances.
This is not just a matter of secure, you can see it in every corner of Hindustan.
If you look around, you can see how people fail to compulsions.
When we still go to a tea shore, when we enjoy the tea there, some of the nearby discussions and discussions will be noticed.
These discussions can be related to politics, sociality, films, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country, this is the problem, this can be solved.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called ASHA-ASHAN for children living in the streets and slums, for this, the poor teamaker spends fifty percent of his arrival.
He provides education, health and food to all the children who come to school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao's hard work, dedication and a new direction for the lives of the poor children.
He left the darkness of his life.
You'll have a lot of things like this.
There will be innumerable events.
Come on, let's encourage good.
The moon will wait for a few days.
I believe that everyone will celebrate with great enthusiasm and on this occasion, especially the children will get good gifts.
Id hopes to strengthen harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
We'll get back to Manki Batt next month.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
71 countries, including India, participated in the event.
When such a big event takes place, you can imagine what will happen when thousands of players from all over the world participate.
Who can leave it in an atmosphere containing the determination to achieve enthusiasm, passion, ideas and hopes.
India records in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badminton.
India won 66 medals including 26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze.
This victory will make every Indian proud.
Everything's drowned in the same emotion.
Words will be sorry directly to make that feeling clear.
But I would like to hear you from the player.
It was my dream to be a single sportsperson of India and Manipur.
Do you know that this time all the restaurants who went to participate in India won the medal
Manika Batra won all the medals they participated.
She is the first Indian woman to win the Gold Medal for India in Personnel Table Tennis.
India got the highest medal shooting.
Fifteen-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest player to win gold medal for India at the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only para power lifter to win the medal at Commonwealth Games for India.
It is also special that this time more women are the medal winners.
Whether squash or boxing or waiting lifting or shooting, women showed wonders.
The last fight at Badminton is Indias two sportspersons, Saina Nehru and P.
Sindhu was also amongst us.
Despite the competition, everyone was eager to get both the medals from India itself.
Sportspersons from different parts of the country have gone from small towns.
They have the role of strong friends in every environment.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I called upon the people, especially the youth to fit India.
Come and cooperate with fit India and urge fit India to lead.
I am very happy that people join it with great enthusiasm.
Shashikanth has written sharing his own picture of the swimming pond, My Weapon is my Body, My Element is water, My World is swimming...
Dhawl Prajapati has written sharing his own picture of trekking and fit India is traveling and trekking for me.
I am very happy to see the well-known people inspire our youth for fit India in a very attractive manner.
The Sanima artist has shared a video in Akshay Kumar's film.
All of you must see in this he's doing exercise with Wooden Beed.
He says that this exercise is very good for the outside and the muscles of the stomach.
There's another video.
In that he's playing volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India's efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
One more thing is to say that Yoga is the name of the Inexpensive Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparations.
The significance of International Yoga Day on June 21 has now been accepted by the world.
You're ready now.
Not only alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your school, everywhere, everybody, be it men or women, should try to connect with yoga.
Today, there is no need to specify in India or anywhere in the world how Yoga is beneficial for the overall development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You've also seen my animated video prevalent.
They're very nice to show a teacher through an ammunition.
You'll get the benefit of that.
I would like to tell you something to invite you for a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time to learn something new now.
Otherwise, internship provides a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to get life in a new way by escaping from paper, pen and computers.
My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
A Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 has been launched in collaboration with the three Ministries of the Government of India - Ministry of Sports, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Drinking Water.
If the students of the college, the youth of NCC, the NSS, the Nehru Yuva Centre, want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to participate in the change of the society, then they can join it, if they want to be the cause of it, if they want to do something active in the society with a positive energy.
It will enhance the support and strength of hygiene, and it will be enjoyed that on 2nd October, when Mahatma Gandhi celebrates his 150th Birth Anniversary, something has been done before that.
The awards will be given at the national level to the best of the participants, the best of the college and those who have done good work at the university.
Not only this, the UGC will provide two credit notes to those who have completed very well.
I invite students, students and youngsters to internship once again and take advantage of this.
You can go to MyGov and register Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youngsters will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I am keen to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, know about the events, send the photo, send the video.
Use this holiday for a new experience.
I would like to urge the people to see it all, and we can see how many people do good things in every corner of our country and what good things are going on.
Last day I saw the story of the youngsters who have gathered selflessly for the education of poor children.
Together with these youngsters, a big programme for education is being started for the street children and children living in the huts of Delhi.
The condition of kids who are begging on the roadside or working on a small scale has caught them, so that they got off for this active activity.
The youngsters and teachers associated with this programme have been making a big effort to transform their lives for two hours and make social changes.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand are inspired by the farmers across the country.
They have changed not only their own but also the destiny of the region through their collective efforts.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand is mainly cultivated by Raghi, Chaulai, rice or barley.
Because of being a hilly area, the farmers did not get the due price.
This biscuit of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
The farmers formed a cooperative group in Munar village and started a biscuit factory.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the government has linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
The biscuit now reaches 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani, not only in Bageshwar district.
With the help of farmers, the annual turnover of the group has not only reached up to Rs. 10-15 lakhs, but it has also resulted in reduction in employment of people from the district due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
We don't think water conservation is a social responsibility
Imagine how to protect every rain drop.
We know that water conservation is not a new subject in the minds of Indians.
Not the subject of the book, not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived it for centuries.
They gave priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They looked for new solutions to maintain every drop of water.
There are large rocks in Manar Kovel, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and New Kottai and many ponds are still like tourist destinations.
But do not forget that these big conservations of water storage are a living example of our ancestors' efforts.
The ponds known as Rani Ki Bawadi of Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat are UNESCO World Heritage Centres and their excellence is worth seeing.
These ponds are water temples in a way.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is one of the largest and most beautiful Bavadi in India, which is in a watershed area.
In April, May, June and July, it is a good time to collect rain water and we will get benefits according to what we prepare for the first time.
In the last three years, everyone has done some of the things in their own way in water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, 64,000 crore has been spent for water conservation of about 55 of the total cost of Rs.
Over the last three years, such water conservation and water management have made about 150 lakh hectares of land more profitable.
Sasur and Khaderi rivers, who were dry with the help of people from about 40-45 villages, were revived.
Whether animals or birds or farmers or farming or village, how blessed is this success for all of them
Ayen Kumar Banerjee MyGov of Devitola village in North 24 Fargan district of West Bengal states that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year, but many do not know the vision of living peacefully, beautifully and inclusively.
Please, people should discuss this issue in the Manki Baat programme to know about this.
Rabindranath was a talented personality and a multi-faceted personality.

We must recognise that India is the land of Lord Buddha by showing the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice and he has guided millions of people all over the world.

Today, this is the most human value required in the world.
Buddhas motivation in the social philosophy of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is very inspiring.
Babasaheb said that my social philosophy was established in three words - freedom, equality and brotherhood.
The roots of my philosophy are in religion, not in ethics.

Babasaheb empowered millions of people who are suffering, exploited, forbidden, who have been laboured, who have been laboured, who have been empowered by the Constitution.
There's no greater example of compassion.
This compassion of people's pain was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
The teachings of Lord Buddha are traditionally available anywhere in Asia.

India's experiment was successful and India was capable of science and technologies.
The day is marked as an exhibition of military power in India's history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that the power of the soul is essential for peace.
Similarly, when you gain strength as a nation, you will be able to live peacefully with all of you.
The Nuclear Test was conducted in May 1998, not only for the country, but also for the country, how it was done and it was very important.
The land of India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India has always laid down new goals and heights.

I read about the online course of Culture in Comal Thakur My GOV.
I am very happy to see you, who have been an IT professional, a cultural love.
It has been told by the concerned sections to get information about the efforts being made in this direction.
I also urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat, who works in Sanskrit, to take forward the suggestion of Kamalji.
He urges everyone to pour water to birds in summer.
Shakal ji, I've got your feeling to all the audiences.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresh ji says I want to tell the youth about their health.
He feels that our youngsters are physically weak when they are tampered with ASEAN countries.
Shanti ji, the Union Government has shared those photographs in the social media and the Narendra Modi App.
Like it, retweet it, get it to friends.
From Chennai, Angha, Jayesh and many children have written to me in the gratitude cards given behind the book "Exam Warrior".
I touched my mind with so many letters, so many phone calls and words I read and heard...
Even if I talk about them, I'll have to talk for months.
In summer, birds and birds have spoken of water.
There are letters of farmer brothers and sisters from Kisan fairs and agriculture to all over the country.
Some people who are aware of water conservation have suggested.
The festival will have letters about our festivals, our culture and our traditions.
In these experiences, in these examples, such inspiration, energy, spirituality, and the spirit of doing something for the country.
This includes the strength of climate change throughout the country.

This is why many letters are related to agriculture.
This time, I have seen the Doordarshan DD Kisan Channel with a video of discussions with the farmers and all the farmers should contact the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan...
Mahatma Gandhi's feeling of soil, farming, farming and farming, and farmers, appears in this line, he said, "To forgot the how to dig the thread and to tie the soil, to forget ourselves.
Likewise, Lal Bahadurashtri had strongly argued about the conservation of trees, plants and trees and the need to adopt good farming practices.

In one of his speeches in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged the farmers to use new technologies and introduce new innovations.
Last day I went to the Krishi Uniti Mela organized in Delhi.
I had a pleasant experience to have my discussions with the farmer brothers and scientists, to know about several experiences related to agriculture, to understand new innovations related to agriculture.
But the most affected me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This very small state has seen a great deal of work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have produced records in 2015-16 compared to five years earlier.
If I say in detail, the MSP considers the wages of other labourers on a small amount, the cost of their four wheels, instruments or instruments rented, the cost of seeds, the cost of all kinds of fertilizers, the cost of irrigation, the interest paid on the state's land tax, the cost of land sowing, not only the farming of the farmer or his family who works on the farming of his own.
Besides, a lot of work is being done for agricultural market reforms in the country to provide fair prices to the farmers.
Efforts are also being made to connect rural markets with Holsey markets and global markets.
My dear countrymen, this year the centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Swachh Bharat is our determination.
Besides, how would one hundred twenty five crore people join shoulder to shoulder with shoulder to pay the best tribute to Gandhiji
I urge you all to share your opinions through My Geovi.
What should be the Logo of Gandhi 150
What should be the slogan, the mantra, or the festival
Today, the country has moved from traditional methods in the health sector.
All the health related matters in the country were already the responsibility of the Health Ministry.
Today, all the departments and Ministries... be it the Ministry of Swachhata or the Ministry of AYUSH or the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the State Governments are working together for a healthy India with affordable healthcare along with defence routes.
Disease prevention is the cheapest and easy healthcare.
As much as we are aware of disease resistance, there will be benefits to the individual, family and society.
Cleanliness is the first thing that life should be healthy.
As a nation, we have faced a challenge, as a result of which sanitation coverage has doubled in four years and almost 80 percent.
Besides, comprehensive work is being done in the construction of healthcare centres across the country.
Today, Yoga has become a public meeting and has reached home with the dedication of all of us.
This time, there will be only 100 days left to reach the International Day of Yoga on June 21.
In the last three International Days of Yoga, people from all over the country and the world participated with enthusiasm.
We must ensure that this time we will do yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do yoga.
Inspire children, youth and elderly citizens in new attractive ways to do Yoga.
Various Yoga programmes are being organized throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can we create a awareness about Yoga as a movement from now on to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share the video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayamas together.
They'll be very helpful.

My dear countrymen, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
Industry was a good medium for him to provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully launch the Make in India campaign in the country, Dr.
With this vision, today, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Cities Mission have been launched in the country, and all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country, be it good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education and digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance.
He wanted no person to live in poverty forever.
At the same time, he believed that his poverty would not be overcome only because he had laid down something for the poor.
Today, initiatives such as Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are giving birth to our young friends.
Various River Valley Authorities and various water-related commissions are the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkars vision for the development of the country.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
He highlighted the importance of Federalism and Federal Systems to work together between the Centre and the States for the development of the country.
He showed us that it is not necessary to be born in a big or rich family at the heights, but some people living in a poor family in India can dream of dreams and make efforts to realize those dreams.
Baba Saheb has played Ambedkar.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes on rural development, poverty welfare and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to participate with enthusiasm in these events.
My dear countrymen, there are several festivals coming in the coming days, the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishakhi.
On the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, it is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and vision of Lord Mahavirji, the messenger of Ahimsa, will inspire all of us.
Greetings to all the people on Mahavir Jayanti.
When we talk about Easter, Jesus Christ's inspirational advice will be remembered, he always gave the message of peace, harmony, justice and compassion to humanity.
Vaishakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science and some are written.
We see the colour of the sea blue, but we understand from our experience that the water does not colour.
Have we ever thought why the water of the river or the sea looks colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in 1920.
This is the question that a scientist has given birth to modern India.
Now when we talk about science, the first time Bharat Ratna C.
One of his findings is famous as Raman Effect.
It is said that this is the day he found the truth of light skating and he got the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
Scientists from Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
The famous 'Boson' party has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai and was inaugurating the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very happy to know about the wonders in the field of science.
Artificial Intelligence will help in manufacturing robots, botts and other specific purpose machines.
Now the machines make their own intelligence smarter through self-leaning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
In that programme on Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientific community how Artificial Intelligence could help in making the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters easier.
Could we be able to know more well about natural ills through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in the field of agricultural production
Can artificial intelligence help in providing healthcare services to all, make it easier and treating diseases in a modern way
Last day, I got the opportunity to participate with the Prime Minister of Israel in the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man told me about the development of a digital device.
I think many such things can be used by artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies are called Value Nutral.
Any machine we want to work.
But we depend on what we want to do with the machine.
Tom Alva Edison, who found the lighting bulb, failed several times in his experiment.
Once asked about this, he replied, "I looked for tens of thousand methods to find a bulb.
"I mean Edison made his strength even after his defeats.
Obviously, Saubhagya, I am in Aravalli, the workplace of Maharshi Aravind today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and raised many questions to British India.
The idea of questioning the truth again and again is important.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't sit quietly until you get answers to questions.
On this occasion of National Science Day, my best wishes to scientists and others associated with science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on all subjects such as security and extremism during difficulties and people write something related to it to me.
Shri Ravindra Singh and Narendra Modi Mobile App have been commissioned from Pune on the safety of jobs.
He wrote that in our country, there is no good security norms in factories and construction works.
Next March 4 is Indias National Security Day and hence, the Prime Minister said that people should be aware of safety and security at the Mann Ki Baat programme.
When we talk about public security, two things are very important, taking initiatives and preparing.
One needs at the time of accident - safety during disorder and the other is necessary in daily life - safety in averid life .
If we are not cautious about safety in everyday life, if there is no such awareness, it is difficult to be at risk.
We have often written on the boards we see on the way - if there is no awareness, the accident will certainly cause a wrong loss, lose happiness and laughter and ensure safety without leaving the world so fast.
I am told that the Fire Brigadukers in the cities of the Fire Brigade should go to each school once a week or perform in front of the children in front of them.
Therefore, there will be two benefits - Fire Brigade will have a habit of sitting carefully and the new generation can know about it.
In terms of disasters, India is a country with diversity in terms of geographical and weather.
This country has faced many disasters like natural calamities, chemical accidents and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority, i. e.
NDMA reaches rapid rescue operations at various accidents like earthquake, floods, cyclone and landslides.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives due to heat wave.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat has decreased significantly to about 220.
It makes us understand that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in the society, there are social organisations, there are aware citizens and I congratulate all those who reach the rescue in minutes whenever there is a disaster.
The number of such familiar heroes is not less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces etc. reach disasters and help the brave people without their lives.
We have to make a society aware of the accident.
In our culture, we preserve values and often talk about security values, but we have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our life.
In our normal life, we are traveling on a plane hundreds of times and we see the air hostess in the air warns about security at the beginning.
We must have heard it hundred times, but if someone takes us to the plane and tell us where everything is, where is the life jacket how to use
That's why our ears on the plane have a habit of hearing, but we don't even think I have these warnings.
This is what happens in all areas of life.
We shouldn't think security is for anyone else.
If we are all aware of our security, then it will also include the feeling of security of the society.
Dear countrymen, this time, with the objective of Swachh Bharat in the budget, the villages had given priority to the subject of 'West to Energy' and 'West to Energy' in Bayogyas.
The objective of this Gobar Dhan Yojana is to clean up the villages, transform the dimension of the animals and composta and biogyasa in farming areas and generate funds and energy.
India has the highest number of four cattle in the world, where about 300 million cattle and their cattle are about 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme, this work is also progressing.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to participate in this gathering called Clean Energy and Green Job and come forward to convert the waste of your village into wealth and transform the supplementary chain.
My dear countrymen, we have heard of many kinds of festivals like music festival, food festival, film festival etc.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the first jubilee festival of the state was held.
The purpose of this festival was to create awareness about sanitation and to make aware of the unique methods of taking the waste of the city actively and bringing it into reuse of the axe.
During this festival, various programmes were organized, in which the people of all the age groups participated.
Inspired by the programme in Raipur, various textile festivals were organized in other districts.
Everybody shared new ideas on cleanliness, discussions and poems in their own way.
The importance of waste processing and hygiene has been presented in a new way in this festival, congratulating the people of Raipur, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers there.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
A lot of events are being organized in our country and around the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred and honoured to those who have done their best in various fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
He said that the idea of full womanhood is a complete freedom, and the idea of Swamiji's advanced 25 years ago shows a sense of women's strength in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life, and it is our responsibility.
We are part of the tradition that we recognize men in the name of women and children were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kausalya-Nandan and Gandhari-Putra.
Today, our women power shows self-sufficiency and confidence through their actions.
With their own progress, they carried the country and society forward and reached a new goal.
Our vision of New India is an extremely women-powered, strong and equitable partner in the overall development of the country.
A lot of examples can be put forward to what women's power can do, and inspiring stories of life can be seen by the environment.
I've got one thing from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand have to consider that these numbers are not very low and 15 lakh women have joined the campaign for a month.
These women in Jharkhand are showing that Swachhta movement in ordinary life can transform culture into a common man's habit.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago, Eliphanta Island had seen electricity in three villages after 70 years of independence and how happy it was for the people there.
You know that Elephanta Island is 10 km away from Mumbai in the sea.
This is a very attractive centre of tourism.
I congratulate the government and the people there.
I am happy that the villages and caves in Eliphanta will now see the light of electricity.
This is not only an electrification but a new beginning of development.
May the light spread in the lives of the people, be happy in the life... whenever the moment will be more pleasant and exciting than this.
Dear countrymen, we celebrated Shivratri last day.
Now, in March, it is the time to produce plenty of farming and golden harvesting wheat and other golden harvesting pomegranates, which is the specialty of this month.
Besides, this month is the Holi festival, which is a favorite month for all.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with Harshollas.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much, greetings.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in the function.
On 1st February, he recalled the commemoration of Kalpana Chaula, who had travelled through space.
While Kalpan had gone to Verpe in the accident of Colombia Space Petrol, millions of youngsters from all over the world had inspired us.
We lose Kalpana Chaula at such a young age and it is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that these women in India are moving very fast in every field and enhancing the country's pride.
In ancient times, women of our country have received the respect, their place in the society and their contributions all over the world wonders.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
I'll tell you about Bai Bachao, Bai Padhao.
In the ancient times, it is said in 'Skandpuran' - Dashuputra, Samayanya, Dashuputra Karyayan, this is the result of availability of Marthya, Tat Availability Kanyakayaya.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, with ten sons, you'll get a virtue in a woman.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why in our society, women have been given the status of strength.
Make this woman power integrate the entire country, the entire society and the entire family into the framework of unity.
Whether it is the panditya of the scholars of the Vedic times, the scholars of Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitrei, the knowledge and devotion of Akamaha Devi and Meerabai, the skill of Ahlyabai Holkar, the courage of Rani Laxmibai, the strength of women will inspire us.
Increase the dignity of the country.
A number of examples have been given following the light trilateral.
He writes that our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's warplane is inspiring to fly on Sukhoi 30.
Under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, she has written about the world tour at INSV Tarini, women members of the Indian Navy.
He mentioned that the three brave women, Bhavnakanth, Mohana Singh, who are the pilots of Chaturvedi Ever Warfare and are trained in Sukhoi 30.
The women led by Skilled Vajpayee are proud of flying to San Francisco, USA and Delhi in Air India's Boying Jat in Delhi.
All women must remember...
These women - the first woman marchant navi captain, the first woman train driver of the journey train, the first woman firefighter, the first woman bus driver in Antar, the first woman in Antar, the first woman in Everest, the first woman in Everest, and the first woman in all such areas - the first of all such women in our women power society, have taken up extraordinary leaderships by achieving the reality of our women.
They have laid down all obstacles and all resistances in the strength of hard work, motivation and determination.
Not only their contemporary people, but also for the future generations.
They will be filled with a new zeal and inspiration.
You have to prepare a book about these women whom you have possessed - not only in the country but also inspire the women's power, in their lives, inspire them.
This is also available for e-books on the Narendra Modi Web site.
Womens strength has a significant role in the positive changes in the country and society.
When we talk about women empowerment, I would like to tell about a railway station.
You must have thought of the link between railway stations and women empowerment.
Ma'Unga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all the workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a territory of Maoism.
The Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere full of violence, attacks, bombs, guns, pistols.
In such a terrible area, tribal women are getting self-sufficient by running e-ORICHA.
For a very short time, many women have been associated with this.
At the same time, it will enhance environmental protection and work.
The District Governance has played a significant role in the success of these women till the District Bharatakoot, from the Grand Availability and Parisalan.
For centuries, individual and social perseverance in our society continues to strive for social evils and evils.
A few days ago, such a start was started in Bihar.
The world's largest humanitarian crisis is about 10,000 km long to root out social evils in the state.
Through this campaign, social witnesses were awakened against the evils of child marriage and women's practice.
The State resolved to fight against evils such as women and child marriage.
The youngsters, mothers and sisters, who are enthusiastic and enthusiastic, participated in this fight themselves.
The humanitarian ecosystem in the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna has become unlimited to the borders of the state.
In order to get the right direction of development for all of the society, it is necessary that society should be free from misconduct.
Let us together pledge to free the society from misconduct and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
He did not know about the Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Yojana earlier.
Now, when we came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Yojana, the cost of death decreased by 75 percent when Nir started buying deserts.
For the past few days, a lot of people had to write about it, and have to say.
The objective of the scheme is to enhance the quality of life and to enhance healthcare for anyone.
Deserts available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 per cent cheaper than branded deserts.
That's why quality buffaloes are available at affordable prices.
More than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
There's not only a desert price but also a new job for those who want to find personal jobs.
Affordable desert is available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and Amrit stores in hospitals.
The only objective of this is to provide affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country is to create a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh in Maharashtra has shared a photograph in the Narendra Modi App.
I am aware that the citizens of Akola have organized a Swachhta Complex to clean the Morna river as per the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Twelve months before the Morna river, the mouse flows only during the rainy season.
The river is completely full of grass and poultry and is a painful sight.
Several wastes are dragged on the river and its shores.
A work plan will be set up and on the first step of Mission Clean Morna, a day before Makar Sankranti, on 13th January, the two sides of the Mornana River will be cleaned at fourteen places in four kilometres area.

The masses can bring about big changes.
Congratulations to the people of Akola, the district administration and the ruling elite, all those who have participated in making this work a mass movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
Dear countrymen, you must have heard of the Padma Awards these days.

Lakshmiji has been serving the society through his own knowledge of greenery.
The nation has given Padma Shri a respect for the contribution of the society by identifying this personality that the world knows.
Their husband died without treatment at the age of 23 years and inspired the poor to build a hospital.

Sometimes we have to invite them in schools and colleges and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, there should be some of the efforts of the society.
Friends, We celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas every year on 9th January.

We pay homage to the great martyrs who laid down their lives for defence.
They're not just theories.
Friends, Congratulations to all of you for 2018, end my words.
Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This is the last day of this year's Mann Ki Baat, which is the last day of 2017.
I shared many things with you this year.
A few hours later, the year will change, but our shared ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, we all remember the great lessons of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of the spirit of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramahamsar used to say, "Serve life with emotion".
An extraordinary life full of courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singhji is a source of inspiration for all of us.
In this effort, he had to lose a lot personally.
It was a very fortunate occasion for me to participate in the Prakash Festival organised in Patna Saheb on the occasion of the 30th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh earlier this year.
We can decide in our mind that we can learn lessons from the great lessons and inspirational lives taught by Guru Gobind Singh and try to build a life.
1st January 2018, i.e. tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say it's special, I say it's really special.
Indian democracy welcomes voters in the 21st century and voters in New India.
This India is excited to welcome you as voters of the 21st century.
You will be proud of being a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
Voting is the most capable of bringing about progressive changes in the lives of millions of people.
You don't only have the right to vote.
You can also be the creators of the 21st century by thinking about how India should be in the 21st century and what your dreams should be about India in the 21st century.
The youngsters of New India are synonymous with enthusiasm, freshness and energy.
The dream of New India is realised through our strong, skilled and strong youth.
When we talk about New India, it is about a free India from racism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
India free from waste and poverty.
New India is accomplishing the aspirations of all.
New India is a power that leads us to peace, unity and harmony.
My youngsters should come forward and analyze how the New India will become.
How can we realize our visions before 2022
How can we build a India like our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, we have to organize a public meeting to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
The population of development, the population of progress, the population for a talented and powerful India.
Today, many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and winning.
I would like to imagine how the youngsters of this New India can get the knowledge of the schemes that are opening up such opportunities, as soon as they are 18 years old, they will be able to get the knowledge of these schemes and become a system that can be achieved by them.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positive thinking and enthusiasm.
There's a report in English, Pesimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The epidemics and reactions were really encouraging.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some people shared the events that have influenced their minds, particularly positively.
Some shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fish Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm talking from the place called Bodel.
According to my husband's suggestion, one rupee per month was insured.
He died in the accident.
So we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
The National Highway has been going through our different villages since 2017.
My name is Satish Bewani.
We have been dependent on the pipeline of the soldiers for the last 40 years.
Now we have a special pipeline.
This was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many people who do such things at their own level in the manner of positive changes in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the New India that makes us all together.
Next time, I got to know about the inspirational story of Pasya Amj and Bashir Khan Khatk at the front of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination, free from the oppression of terrorism and hate.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 the terrorists had burnt his heritage house.
His family had to leave his legacy land and migrate there was much more terrorism and violence.
He chose a different way for himself and served the people.
To escape from the opposite circumstances, he himself created the story of victory.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth of the country.
Even though the environment is bad, Anju has proved to be unsuccessful with positive steps to despair.
Last week I had the opportunity to see some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
There was enthusiasm, enthusiasm, energy, dream and determination.
I got inspiration as long as I spent with those kids.
This is the power of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the Shabarimala temple of Kerala not only in my country but also in the world's famous religious places.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees reach every year to get the blessings of Lord Ayyapaswamy.
How big challenge can it be to save such a great place of devotee, such a great place of devotee
If there are mountains and jungles, do you say specially
A police officer named Vijayan launched a programme called Poona Poona Poona Poonavan under which an awareness campaign has been started in the field of waste defecation.
Any devotee has become a habit that the journey cannot be completed without any physical work on cleanliness.
There are no big people in this campaign, no small people.
Every devotee considers it to be part of the worship of God for some time, works for cleanliness, works for removing waste.
It is surprising that every morning the sight of the waste waste waste waste waste and all the pilgrims participate in it.
Whether it is a big celebrities, however big the wealthy, however big the office bearers, everybody participates in the programme of pilgrimage like ordinary devotees.
There are many such examples in front of us.
Puja is a part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees in such a sanitation place in Shabarimala.
There is a simultaneous pledge to clean up with a severe wound.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we took a pledge to fulfil Bapus incomplete mission of supreme Swachh Bharat and Swachh Bharat.
Bapu ji worked for the same thing throughout his life.
In rural areas and urban areas, changes have been seen in collaboration with the people in a wide range.
The worlds largest survey Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted between 4th January and 10th March, 2018 to assess the achievements made in the field of sanitation in urban areas.
The Survey will be conducted in more than 4,500 cities in about 40 crore people.
I'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
Analysis of the use of Swachhta App and upgradation of various service centres will be done.
It will be checked whether the city has made all arrangements to transform the cleanliness of the city into the habit of the people and to become the habit of the city.
Don't want the government to clean up.
All citizens and citizens' organisations have great responsibility.
I urge all the people to participate enthusiastically in the Swachhta Survey that will take place in the coming days.
Try not to lag behind your city, to avoid your street and village.
On the basis of this survey, the ranking of cities will be done - if your city has more than one lakh people, in rankings at the country level, if there is less than one lakh population, then it should be your dream to get the highest position in local rankings.
Come, with this determination, once again reminding Bapu, we can use the best initiatives with the determination of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things look very small but as a society, there is a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I would like to share such a thing with you in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
Injustice has been done to Muslim women for decades, but no one has discussed it.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have advised the Minority Affairs Ministry to ensure that all women who apply to go alone are allowed to go to Haj.
Generally, the elections are being held by ruining Haj pilgrimage and I want women who are appealing to go alone to avoid this hesitation and give them an opportunity to consider them as a special category.
India's development journey has progressed on the basis of our women's strength and their talent.
I am confident that it will continue to move ahead and I want our women and men to get equal rights and get equal opportunities and our constant effort to move together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, it will be remembered on 26th January, 2018.
This year, leaders from 10 ASEAN countries will come to India as chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations.
This time, on Republic Day, there will be no more than ten chief guests.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and in 2017, India's association with ASEAN completed 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians to join these great leaders from 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is the country of festivals.
I don't even know that there was a day that wasn't associated with the festival.
We've just celebrated Christmas now, New Year's coming here.
May the New Year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us move forward with new freshness, new enthusiasm, happiness, new determination, and lead the country forward.
The Month of January is the time when the sun moves to Uttaranchal and this month is celebrated with Makar Sankranti.
This is a festival related to nature.
In Rajasthan, all festivals like Sankranth, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
All these festivals are celebrated between January 13 and January 17.
All the names of these festivals are different but the basic principles are the same.
My best wishes to the New Year 2018 once again.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Mann Ki Baat, September, 2019
At age, they are greater than us, they are witnesses to every step in the country and every step in the country.
I had the privilege of talking to Didi on phone before leaving for foreign travel.
It was a lovely conversation like Anujan speaking to his sister.
I don't normally speak about personal conversations like this.
Modiji-Latadididi, Pramanam.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes and best wishes to Modiji on his birth anniversary.
May the health of the daughter be good, and the blessings of the sister be made to us all.
He was calling to pay homage to Didi before he went to America.
I was very happy to hear that Lataji-Modiji's phone will come.
Will you go back to me
Everyone at home...
Lataji, I think it is with the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the audience.
You don't know what you are.
I know that the picture of India is changing as you come.
Modiji yes.
Mother is very happy with this love of Modiji and sister.
I am extremely grateful to Modiji and sister always remember me.
Once again, I wish my birthday.
Modiji had come to Mumbai this time.
Modiji, but I'll be late.
Modiji should come home and eat some Gujarati food from the hands of his sister.
Lataji, of course.
I'm lucky to think that.
Modiji - Pramanam Deeti.
Lata ji Pranamam.
Congratulations to Modiji-Didi, Namaste Namaste.
Modiji Namaste.
My dear countrymen, with the new night, the time of celebrations has once again reached with new zeal, new energy, new spirit and new determinations.
Now the whole country will be full of festivals for weeks.
All the family members will gather together in the festivals.
This is the darkness under the light.
Perhaps this word has only words, it is an order for all of us, a vision, a motivation.
On the one hand, while some houses are brightened, on the other hand, you think the darkness is covered in some nearby leaves in front of them.
The real happiness of these festivals is that when this darkness doesn't exist, it's very low light.
They're looking for the needy by collecting clothes, sweets and food from people's homes.
This time, in this season of festivals, can we try to make the darkness below the light with the awakening and determination
The smile of the face of many poor families will double your happiness in the festivals, your face will be more shiny, your light will be more bright and your Diwali will be more shiny.
Can we welcome Laxmi in a new way this time
In our culture, daughters are considered as Lakshmi because daughters bring good fortunes and prosperity.
With our own dedication and dedication, with wisdom, and with the name of the family, society and the country, many daughters will be amongst us.
Can we honour these Laxmis of India on this occasion of Diwali
We have many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things.
Our society should recognize such daughters, respect them and be proud of them.
Together, we all have organized a great gathering called Selfie with Daughter, as it has spread all over the world.
Likewise, this time we will organise a public gathering of Bharat Ki Lakshmi.
Encouraging Laxmi of India is a way to strengthen the prosperity of the country and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have said earlier that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have got the opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with many people who have known and unknown me.
A student from Arunachal, how far last day, Aleena Thyang sent me a very funny letter.
My country is Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my results came, people asked me if I read the book Exam Warriors.
After that my experience was very good.
If I read that book before the exam, I felt very good.
At the same time, this little friend has given me a job.
But I have a request that you can help me.
I'm sure it's all.
I'll definitely try to write in my words, in my own way.
I once again express my gratitude to this young friend of Arunachal, student Alina Thaiang.
Look.
This time, as we have discussed the victory in the Open, the speech of Governor Up Daniel Medvedev was also discussed and there was a lot of popularity in social media.
I also heard that speech and played.
In Dan, 23, the motivation of Madvedev and his power were attracting everyone.
Of course it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he failed to speak to Rafael Nadal, a 19-year-old Grand Slam winner and historian in Tennis.
If someone else was on this occasion, he would have become depressed and disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the audience.
Nadal, a Dan champion, praised Nadal and said how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis, how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal and humility of a man who failed in a single game was to be seen.
If you don't hear Medvedev's words in Dan, I'd like to tell you all, especially the youth to see that video.
It's a great moment for people from all classes and age groups to learn and beyond the princely states.
The princes aren't a big deal.
Life is a victory.
In our country's sciences, it has been described in a very beautiful way.
The thinking of our ancestors is certainly commendable.
It is said in the scriptures: Vidya Vinaya Upaita Haritina Chetansi Kasya Manujasyamani Kanchana combination is Loksya Lochananandam, who cannot win his mind if a person is united with qualification and humility.
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, I'm going to tell you now for your good.
There will be debates, parties and opponents, but there will be great success in preventing some things before they grow up.
It's very difficult to stop some things when it's too big, very wide.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully, we can protect something.
Tobacco intoxication is the cause of nicotein.
Eating this in childhood only affects the growth of the brain .
But today I want to tell you about a new subject.
You must have known that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
E-cigarettes are different from normal cigarettes.
When the liquid substance containing nicotine in e-cigarette is hot then a kind of chemical smoke forms .
Like other cigarettes, it mixes aromatic chemicals to not spread stink from it.
Even if the father had a chain smoker at home, he saw others at home trying to stop smoking, and children would not have a habit of smoking cigarettes and bidi.
He doesn't want to smoke cigarettes at home.
He knows that smoking and tobacco cause great harm to the body.
But e-cigarettes are very different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarettes.
It's very ignorant about the accident, so sometimes the e-cigarette gets admission in the house just like it's just foolish.
You know if someone smokes around us, we can smell it with smell.
In his pocket, cigarette packets, but it's smelling.
However, e-cigarettes are not so, so many children and youngsters are roaming around in their books, offices, pockets, and sometimes in their hands, in their books, like fashion, or not.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
This new method of intoxication is prohibited in the country in order to destroy our youth, not to pursue the dreams of the families, not to destroy the lives of the children, this disease is prohibited from spreading roots in the society.
I urge everyone to quit tobacco addiction and not misunderstanding e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, right
It does not mean Fit India is going to Jim for two hours morning and evening.
For fit India, we have to stay away from it.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a great Vasundhara.
Several human tricks are pouring on this earth.
India was the birthplace of extraordinary people like that, and the workplace.
They are dedicated to others, not for themselves.
Such a great personality will be honoured at Vatican City on 13th October.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians and Pope Francis will declare Maryam Treasia holy on 13th October.
Sister Maryam Treasia, who worked for the betterment of humanity in his narrow life of 50 years, is an example of the world.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrate Gandhi 150, we are proud of not only India but the whole world is proud that we have taken a pledge to get rid of the plastic used by 130 crore people once.
India has shown a move in front of the world in terms of environmental conservation, so the whole world is now the light of India.
I am confident that all of you will be part of the gathering to remove single use plastic on 2nd October.
At every point, people play their own role in this triple.
But a young man in our country has done a very different move.
When I turned my attention to this work, I called him and tried to know and understand his new methods.
He said it can be beneficial for the country and the people.
Mr.
For the first time when I heard the word Plogging, it was a new word.
Perhaps this word may be used in foreign countries.
But in India, the Ripudaman Dalvi gave it a lot of popularity.
Come on, let's talk to him.
130 crore people use only one step in this direction, and our India will continue to take 130 crore steps in terms of elimination of integrated use plastic.
Ripudaman ji, thank you once again.
My best wishes to you and your team and to this new vision.
I want to remind you of one thing.
However, it is time for some people to start training, to plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August, I told you from the Red Fort that you should travel to 15 places in India by 2022.
Make a plan to stay at least one night or two nights at least 15 places.
You see, understand, experience India.
My dear countrymen, once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on the various festivals of India full of diversity.
Yes, yes.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should also be kept in mind that people are not supposed to be accidental or accidental.
We need to take care of that.
Together, we will celebrate festivals with enthusiasm, with new dreams and new determination.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Hello to my dear countrymen.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the children from Karnataka.
He urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country at a function organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Vijay Karnataka Day.
And they published the selected letters.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These small children also know the problems of the country.
They also know the discussions in the country.
Kirti Hagde from Uttarkanta... complimenting Digital India and Smart City Projects, the child says that we have to make changes in our educational system and that children do not like classroom reading and they like to know about nature.
If we give children knowledge about nature, perhaps it will be very beneficial in the future to protect the environment.
Reeda Nadaf, a child from Laxmeshwar, writes that she is proud of being the daughter of a soldier.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers
And it's natural to be proud if the army's daughter is too much.
Irfan Baigam from Calburgi writes that the school is 5 km away from home, so it has to leave home early and it's late at night to return home.
That's why he says he can't spend time with friends and he says he should have a nearby school.
But I liked that the newspaper had done that letter to me, so I could read those letters.
It's a good experience for me.
Dear people, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
This is the same day in 1949 the Constituent Assembly of India accepted the Constitution.
The Constitution came into force on 26th January 1950, so we celebrate the same day as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked for nearly three years to build the Constitution of India.
It will be a matter of pride for those who read about this discussion who were dedicated to the nation.
Can we imagine how hard they worked to create a nation full of diversity
When the country gets rid of the slavery of slaves, how much they have expressed their vision of discretion and vision.
It's not an area of untouchable life, there's no subject of nature.
Equality and sympathy for all are the faces of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in reality.
Be it a citizen or a ruler, we must move forward with the feelings of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should suffer any kind of damage.
17 different committees were constituted on the basis of important issues in the Constituent Assembly.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution.
He played a great role.
On 6th December, on the day of his Mahanirvana, we remember and remember him regularly.
Baba Saheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the sacred day.
Sardar Patel has become a steel person from the farmer's son and has done a very extraordinary thing in a country's framework.
Sardar Saheb was a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was the Chairman of the Consultative Committees constituted for the welfare of Minorities and Tribals.
I remember and salute the brave citizens, police personnel and security officers who lost their lives that day.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Today, terrorism is taking a terrible form in every part of the world as a day-to-day event.
We have suffered a lot in India for the past 40 years due to terrorism.
Our thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is challenging humanity.
This is the land where Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi sent a message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism make a cruel effort to weaken our social relations.
Therefore, it is necessary for the time to be more awakened by human forces.
My dear countrymen, on December, all of us will observe Navy Day.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the river.
This country has an unprecedented link between our land and the oceans.
If we look at history, 800-900 years ago, the rice naval force was considered to be the most powerful naval force in the rice dynasty.
Their naval forces played a major role in the growth of the Chholas empire and making them the economic power of the time.
Several examples of the naval expeditions and exploration journeys of rice can be seen in collectiveness.
Most of the world's naval forces have been supplied to women in warships for a long time.
However, in the rice naval force, 800-900 years ago, many women had played a very important role.
Women also participated in the war.
The Chala rulers knew very well about the construction of the ship.
When we talk about the naval force, who can forget his ability to make Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the naval forces.
The Konkan coast was in the state of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts such as Sindhudurg, Murud Janjira and Golden Fort associated with Shivaji Maharaj were either beside the sea or surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy was waiting for the safety of these forts.
The Maratha Navy had large ships and small boats.
Their naval forces were capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from the enemies.
How do we remember Kanhoji Angre when we recall the Maratha Navy
He took the Maratha Naval Force to a new height and set up camps of the Maratha Naval Force at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions, whether in Goa's liberation campaign or in the 1971 Indian-Pakistan war.
When we talk about the naval forces, the war is in our eyes, but the Indian Navy has come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian affairs.
The ship Sumitra immediately helped save the people and transferred many of the fisheries from the sea safely to Bangladesh.
When there was a major flood in Sri Lanka in May-June this year, three ships of our naval forces immediately arrived there and helped the government and the people there.
On 21st November, when a trade ship was robbed in the West Golf, INS reached Trikund for help.
Our navy has been proud and proud of our security forces, we are always proud of our security forces, and are respected by the neighbours, whether to provide healthcare services to the Fuji or to provide immediate relief, and to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country at a time of accident.
Whether it is the Armed Forces, the Navy or the Air Force... all Indians bow down to the bravery, bravery, bravery, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the country to live comfortably and peacefully for the hundred and fifty five crore people.
Army Flag Day is celebrated on 7th December every year.
This is a day of pride and respect for the soldiers of the country.
I am happy that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to organise a programme from 1st December to 7th December, which is a programme to reach the citizens of the country and make people aware about the Armed Forces.
In a week, children and adults should wear the flag.
There should be a movement of respect for the army in the country.
You can call the soldiers in schools and colleges and get information about the army from them.
We can make it a good opportunity for our new generation to know about the army.
This opportunity is to collect wealth for the well-being of all the soldiers of our armed forces.
The funds are being used through the Military Welfare Board for the rehabilitation of the families of the heroes and the injured soldiers in the war.
We can also contribute to their well-being.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
All we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to soil.
Imagine what happens if there is no soil produced in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
It has been thought in our culture long ago, so we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, there is a natural effort to have agriculture, soil, devotion and gratitude, on the other hand, scientific schemes were part of life to nurture the soil.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to the soil and conservation of soil in a scientific manner.
We are proud that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are interested in modern science, are trying for it and take appropriate decisions.
I heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorund Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The production capacity of soil has gradually decreased.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and treated them on timely revision of their soil and advised them to provide chemicals, other fertilizers, micronutrients and bio-development.
You will be surprised to hear the outcome of the advice that the information received from the soil health tests has been implemented.
At the same time, the quality of soil has increased.
Farmers have started feeling that if we want to think about the crops, first think about the maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal maternal
Our farmers have made more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to cultivate soil.
We have devotion to Mother Bhuma, but have we thought how harmful the mother's health with chemicals like urea
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that the motherland has serious damage due to the use of urea more than required.
Can our farmers decide that half of the urea used in farming can be used in 2022 when we are 75 years of independence
We all have started feeling global temperature and climate change.
There was a time when it started cold before Diwali.
Now the beginning of December, the cold has slowly stepped down.
The 8-year-old unspeakable child made Visil his weapon.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, he climbed to the houses of the village, waking up people, he started teaching them not to defecate in the open place with handlooms.
Kumhari village was free from external defecation due to this child who was teaching about cleanliness every day in 30-40 houses.
The younger child, Tushar, has been inspiring to promote cleanliness.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are determined, capable and courageous.
We'll get somethin' to learn.
Today they work well in every field.
Whether in sports, in any competition or in any social step, our disabled people are not behind anyone.
Our Divyang sportspersons have won four medals in the Rio Olympics and you will remember that the D-20 Cricket of the blind is a champion in the World Cup.
Different kinds of competitions are being held across the country.
The seventeenth National Para Swimming Competition was organised in Udaipur last day.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in this and showcased their skills.
One of them is Giger Tucker from Gujarat and 80 of his body has no muscles.
He was selected for the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics as a result of his skills.
He is one of the 32 Para Swimmers trained in the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salute to Jigger Taker... to him... my best wishes.
Today, the Divyangjans can reach any area and have a special focus on opportunities.
It is our endeavour to ensure that everyone in the country becomes capable and a society inclusive should be formed.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day, the prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
My heartfelt best wishes to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I think it's very good to add something to this suggestion and make changes.
The elders in our village will always say.
Forget sorrows, don't forget comfort.
Can't you make sure you have your role in this
Come on, let us share good wishes in the Narendra Modi App, MiGOV or on social media in positive India (Hashtag Positive India).
Remember the events that are inspired by others.
Remembering good things will have a feeling of doing good.
The energy to do good things.
We can see the strength and consequences of this collective shape together.
There's a chance to speak a lot of things.

Even though the sun and water are important in Chhath Puja, the utensils and fountains made of bamboo and soil are essential in respect of its worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshipping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will respect and worship those who are admired.
But the Chhath Puja gives us a message to those who are sure to be worshipped.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also linked to this festival.
Cleaning the entire house before Chhath, people are enthusiasticly involved in rivers, lakes and ponds, pilgrimages i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is a celebration of environmental protection, illness prevention and faculty.
It is natural for anyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
You may be happy to hear that such a business has been done in a store of Khadi and Handicrafts.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift coupons increased by about 680 percent.
Overall sales of khadi and handicrafts have seen an increase of about 90 this year as compared to last year.
It shows that today young people, women and people of all ages like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, and how many families working in handloom.
He says we should also remember our brave security forces.
We're also supposed to send home sweets to the soldiers.
I was fortunate to celebrate Diwali once again with the brave security forces deployed on the border.
This time, I was an unforgettable experience to celebrate Diwali with the security forces in the Gures sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces are protecting the country by directing the harsh and difficult situations on the border and respecting all our security forces for that struggle, dedication, sacrifice and sacrifice for all the countrymen.
If we get the opportunity, we have to hear their prideful stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us don't know that the soldiers of our security forces are not only on our borders but also playing an important role in establishing peace across the world.
They are enhancing the fame of Hindustan all over the world as the Peace Keeper of the United Nations.
Last day, on 24th October, the United Nations Day was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their positive role.
We believe the Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
As a result of this belief, India has been actively participating in various important steps of the United Nations since its inception.
India has always given importance to women's equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
Its origin was suggested in the Kingdom that all men were born free and equal, as a result of the efforts of Indias representative Hamsa Metha, it was recognized that all human beings were born free and equal.
Looks like it's a very simple change, but it's a healthy thinking.
Indias biggest contribution to the United Nations is the peace mission of the United Nations.
India has always played an active role in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Some of you would be the first to know about this.
More than 16,000 Indian security personnel have served in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about seven thousand soldiers of India are associated with the UN peacekeeping operations, India is ranked third in the world.
By 27th August, Indian Jawans have served around 50 missions in 71 peacekeeping missions across the world in the United Nations.
These missions were from various territories of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Labanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients were treated in the Indian Army hospitals and saved innumerable people.
The security forces of India saved not only the people in different countries, but also won their hearts through mass harmony.
Indian women have also played a key role in establishing peace.
Many don't know that India is the first country to send women police teams to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This step of India is a source of inspiration for countries around the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police groups.
You will be surprised to hear that India's role is not only in peaceful purposes but also in about 85 countries India is providing training to the Peace Diaspora.
Our brave peacekeepers have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha.
Peace mission measures are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work to pass through remote areas.
We have to live among different people.
We need to know and understand different ecosystems and different cultures.
You must change yourself according to the local requirements and conditions there.
Who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salari when he remembered our brave United Nations peacekeepers today, he fought for peace in Congo, Africa and sacrificed his self-confidence.
Every Indian will be proud to remember him.
In 1989, at the age of 70, he was appointed the Operation Force Commander in Namibia, who served the freedom institution of that country.
General Timei, the head of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peace Force in Cyprus and sacrificed all for peace.
India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world as a peace ambassador.
We believe that everyone must live with peace and harmony and move forward to create a good and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage is brightened by the great men who have served humanity selflessly.
We were one of those extraordinary people who denounced the sister-in-law, saying Bhagini Nivedit.
Margaret Elizabeth lived in Ireland, but Swami Vivekanandan named him Nivad.
The word 'Niveditta' is entirely dedicated.
Then they dedicated themselves to the name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives by the influence of Swami Vivekananda and dedicate their lives to the poor.
Sister Nivedita's heart pained the attacks in the British regime.
Not only did the British slave in our country but they tried to make us mentally slaves.
They continued to strive to create an absurd awareness in our country by showing our culture.
Bhagini re-established the pride of Indian culture.
Subrahmanya Bharati, a well-known nationalist and Tamil poet, is known for the empowerment of a revolutionary woman.
Its inspiration is said to be Bhagini Nivadita.
Jagdish Chandra Bose, a great scientist who has been appointed Bhagini, worked in collaboration with him.
They helped in propagating Bose's research through articles and conferences.
Indias unique beauty is spirituality and science in our culture.
Sister Niveditta and Jagdish Chandra Bose are a strong example of this.
Hundreds of people died when a terrible plague spread in Kolkata in 1899.
Cleanliness work has started on the roads and roads without taking care of their own health.
Sister, a woman who came out to serve the poor even though he could live a comfortable life.
Inspired by their sacrifices, people came forward to cooperate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important heroes and heroes in the creation of a New India.
Your grief is true that the diseases of older people and the diseases in the evening of life have already started to appear in children.
It is surprising to hear that children are also afflicted with diabetes.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are called lifestyle disorders.
The main reason for the occurrence of such diseases to the youth is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle, and the changes in food habits.
Societies and families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about it, you don't need to do anything special.
It is only necessary to make small things properly and make them habitual and make it their own nature.
Instead of climbing up and descending the kids on the elevator, make the habit of climbing and climbing the stairs.
After dinner, try to take the whole family and walk a little bit.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
It's because I'm habituated to say that a person of any age can do it easily.
It is easier to learn indiscriminately and it is easy to say that it can be done anywhere, so it is comfortable.
There is no need for equipment or plains.
Several studies are being conducted on how much yoga is beneficial in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of life without seeing it as a medium of medicine.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have received good news in the past from sports.
Our sportspersons have thrown the country in different games.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup hockey crown through a good game.
Our sportspersons played a good game, so that India could become Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the support staff who helped the entire team.
After Hockey, India also heard a good news in Batminton.
Batminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open Crown and made Indians proud.
After the Indonesia Open and the Australian Open, the Super Series Territory won the crown.
I extend my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and enhancing Indias pride.
Friends, This month FIFA Under 17 World Cup competitions were held.
Teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showcased their skills in the football field.
I got a chance to go to see a game.
Sportspersons and audiences were very excited.
World Cup competitions have been successful and all teams have shown their best sports.
Even though India was not able to win the crown, the young sportspersons of India enjoyed their hearts.
The whole world enjoyed the festival of this game, including India, and the tournament was once attractive and attractive to football lovers.
Football's future is bright.
I once again extend my best wishes to all the sportspersons and all those who work with them.
Some send photographs of these missions of young children, some will be the story of the collective efforts of the youth.
There, a team of non-governmental organisation called Eco-Protection Organisation (Economic Protection Organisation) came out to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
During this 200-day long work, people continued to clean up a group in the fort without getting tired.
I am surprised to see the photograph and I will tell those who are disappointed to realise the dream of sanitation and disappointed by seeing the environmental hygiene, you will see the youngsters of the economic protection organisation, their sweat, their zeal and their determination directly in those active pictures.
If you see it, you'll be disappointed.
This Bhagirath effort for cleanliness is a miraculous example of beauty, harmony and integrity.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
People have a feeling of unity and equality in their minds by eating food together.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the meaningful life - to pray, to work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev composed Guruvani to tell him.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come on, let us try to move on the path of his message and his teachings.
My dear countrymen, after two days, we will celebrate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's birth anniversary on 31st October.
We all know that he has laid the foundation for modern Unity India.
If we travel through the extraordinary life of that great son of Bharatamba, we can learn a lot.
His expertise was to bring thoughts to the path of action.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the bitterest of India's work in a pattern.
He assured crores of Indians to be brought under the purview of One Nation, One Constitution.
He gave him the capability to overcome all obstacles, to take his firm decision.
He set a goal and moved forward to that goal.
He could have done this task of uniting the country.
All were equal nations in his imagination.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had said and always inspired us.
These words of Sardar Sab are still inspired and inspired by our vision of New India.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this festival of mutual understanding that you are also for unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, with a new vision, with a new determination, you all will revert to daily life.
My best wishes to all the people of the country to realize their dreams.
Three years have been completed after the Mann Ki Baat programme was launched by Akashwani.
This is the thirty-sixth episode.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can talk about those who send their minds from every corner of the country, but I get a lot of treasure.
Most of me are inspiring.
A few things are about reforms in government affairs.
Sometimes there are individual complaints, sometimes attracts attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember one thing that Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
I am sure that after three years, sociologists, universities, researchers and media experts will analyze this and bring light to the heights of all subjects.
I am sure that this discussion will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, it will get a new spirit and new energy.
Mann Ki Baat said that when we eat food, we should take it as much as we need.
But letters came from every corner of the country, from social organisations and youth that they were already doing this.
Thereafter, how many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Not only in India, but also in the world, the Self-with-Doter programme has become a big step.
This is not just a problem in social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
Every parents started feeling like taking some selfie to their own daughter.
All the girls started feeling that they have importance and importance.
Last day I was discussing with the Union Tourism Department...
I told those who came out of tourism wherever they went, I wanted to send photographs to India.
In a way, the pictures of lakhs of photographs and all corners of India have become a big economy for those who work in the tourism sector.
I am convinced of how big events are happening in Mann Ki Baat.
It was three years ago that the events of the last three years have come to light.
The country is moving forward with the right path.
This is a big capital for any country, a big power.
I bow to the people with my heart.
Once I talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat, Khadi said that Khadi was not a cloth, a thought stream.
The household shoes, twigs, and kartakhano... seem to be interested in young people's tile khadi.
Khadi's sales have increased, so the poor's house is directly connected to employment.
Khadik Rebate is being issued from 2nd October and is very low.
This will give strength to the poor of our country, to name it.
Increasing interest with Khadi has encouraged people working in the Khadi sector to think in a new way in tax and khadi in the government.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring solar power
The ancient heritage has been decayed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think how to revive it.
We have collected a variety of works.
Several people have created job opportunities.
The Khadi Village Industries Division in Pampore, Kashmir has revived its training categories that have been locked in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to contribute to this region.
The resumption of this Training Centre will help the new generation to build innovative manufacturing, ghee and new products.
Ordinary people and others have started giving khadi products as gifts.
In a natural way, we can realise how a thing gets encouraged.
My dear countrymen, we all decided in Mann Ki Baat last month that we will celebrate the Swachhta Festival across the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti.
It is said that cleanliness will connect with the people.
Our Honble President started this and the nation joined it.
Today, the aged people, women, cities and villages are part of the cleanliness mission.
I thank the Honble President.
People from all sections of the country have considered it as their own, and everyone is associated with it.
Be it the sports sector, the film sector, the education sector, the schools, the colleges, the universities, the farmers, the workers, the officials, the government employees, the police and the army, the survey is related to this.
There has been a change in prevention of others from polluting the public places and the people working there have started feeling a little pressure.
I am happy that in the first four days of the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, more than 75 lakh people have joined me with the work related to more than 40,000 start-ups.
We're cleaning one place this time, and others care not to be cleaned carefully.
But if cleanliness is a habit, it must become an emotional spirit.
This time, with the name of 'Swachhata Hi Seva', fish also took place.
More than two and a half children participated in the Swachhta Lectures.
Thousands of children brought colorful pictures.
I do not forget to express my gratitude to media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They carried this gathering very sacredly.
They joined them in their own way and contributed immensely to creating a progressive environment.
A few days ago, somebody took my attention to the work of the 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
Their brand Ambassador of Cleanliness has made Sri Nagar Nayak Bilal Dar a hero in the sports sector when you talk about the Brandy Ambassador.
On seeing plastic, polythene, bottles and other silkwords, the bill removes it and makes a little income.
Billa's Corporate Ration gave a car and uniform, and he went to other places and told people the lessons of cleanliness, inspires people, stays behind it until they see the results.
Bill Dar is a young child of age, but he is inspired by everyone interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
Dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of today's history and it is natural for me to remember the great men when talking about history.
This month of October we remember many great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who led us and led us to the 21st century, who had suffered many difficulties for the country, were in front of us in October this month.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal Jisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing to live for the country, to do something for the country...
Not only did Gandhiji, Jaiprakash Ji and Deendayal Ji showcased their lives in their lives, are miles away from the corridors of power, but they lived with a lot of life and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about the human beings who stood at the last corner of the society.
Sardar Sab united the country.
We have to run forward to unity.
You have experienced this diversity of India, touch it, feel its fragrance.
You will see that these diversities of our country will work as a big school for the development of your personality.
Holidays are the days of Deepawali... we have a habit of traveling anywhere in the country.
Tourist journey is natural .
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand, but with the influence of description, we like to travel abroad.
The people of western India don't know what is in the entire India.
How diverse is our country
It should be noted that when Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilakan, Swami Vivekanandan and our former President Abdul Kalanji had visited India, they had got a new inspiration to see, understand, live and die for them.
All these great men traveled all over India.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
He tried to embrace India.
As a student can we try to understand and voluntarily understand our different states, different communities, people, their lifestyles, their traditions, their dresses, their food habits and their beliefs
The value addition to tourism is not just because we look at it, but by understanding it as a student and trying to become a part of it.
I would have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of the country by telling my own experience.
I've got the opportunity to stay in more than 450 districts at night...
Today, when I have this responsibility in this country, I have the experience of those journeys.
I'm comfortable to understand things.
I appeal to you that you have not realised the unity in the diversity of this vast India as a seal, but as a store of our immense power.
It has the dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food items are there .
I don't have to repeat if you eat every day every day.
This is the greatest strength of our tourism sector.
Not only do you want to go out of the house during this holiday, you don't want to get off for a change, go to know, understand and get something.
Include India and involve the diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be more prosperous through these experiences.
The limits of your thinking will be widespread.
Who's a greater teacher than experience
Normally, the time from October to March is time for travel.
People are traveling.
I'm sure if you go this time, you'll take my call forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share your pictures.
Send a photo on the subject of Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you can communicate with the people in the walking place, send photographs.
Not only for buildings, but also for natural beauty, but also for the life of the people there.
Write a nice writing about the journey.
Send My Gavi to Narendra Modi App.
I think it would be better to encourage tourism in India to find out the best seven tourist destinations in your state.
If you can go to those seven places.
Can you give some information about it
Filmmaking, making video and encouraging publicity about such good places - the government will recognize the varieties you find.
You can also be a source of inspiration to promote tourism during the period from October to March.
I invite you to it.
I have a deep influence in my mind.
I'm a man like you.
One thing that happened last day must have been in your mind and people have seen a divine example of women's strength and patriotism.
Its abnormality is that the husbands of Swati and Fund are sacrificed by serving Mother India.
Can we imagine what will happen if there is no life in this young age
But Balidani Colonel Anand Mahadik's wife, Swat Mahadik, determined this tough situation directly in the mind and joined the Indian Army.
He has been trained for 11 months and has changed his life to realize his husband's dream.
His wife's fund took a firm decision and joined the army.
We can be proud of this maternal power and it is natural for all people to respect these heroes.
I convey my best wishes to those two sisters.
They have inspired millions of people of the country with new inspiration and spirit.
My best wishes to those two sisters.
Dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between Navaratri festival and Diwali.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is going on in our country.
I'm sure the football will be all around.
Every generation will be interested in Football.
My dear countrymen, this is the new night.
It's time to worship Durgam Bay.
The whole atmosphere is clean and pure.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
It is believed to be the festival of power.
On the 75th anniversary of Indias independence in 2022, let us move forward by making a five-year framework to realize the dreams of freedom fighters, the determination of hundred twenty-five crore people, the determination, the scale of work, the scale of effort and determination.
Thank you many.
English rendering of the text of Malayalam Speech by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to the people of India on 27th August, 2017 at 11 a.m.
My heart is blessed with respect to my dear countrymen.
On the one hand, when the country is drowned in festivals, on the other hand it is natural for the country to get rid of the news of violence from any part of Hindustan.
Our country is a country of Buddha and Gandhi and is a country of Sardar Patel, who laid down his life for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have recognized common life values, non-violence and mutual respect, it is a part of our mind.
We have been telling Ahimsa Paramodharma since childhood.
I said from the Red Fort that in the name of faith, be it religious belief, be it political belief or belief in traditions, there will be no violence.
There is a provision for justice for all individuals in the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This country will never be allowed, no government will be allowed to allow those who pursue the law, who are guided by the path of violence, whether individual or society.
Everyone has to head before the law.
The law will determine responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not merely in food habits, lifestyles and dresses.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Our celebrations are also diverse.
Our cultural heritage has been centuries old, looked at cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, but there will be no ceremonial day in 365 days.
Looking at all our festivals, we can see that there is no festival related to the timelines of nature.
Everything is directly related to nature.
Many of our festivals are connected to the farmers and are directly connected to the fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals, for the first time, I want to tell you 'Mithami Dukadam'.
Yesterday, there was a celebration of 'Samvatsari' in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival of 'Varushan' is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the celebration of 'Varushan' is the day of the anniversary.
This is a really amazing tradition.
The festival is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is known as 'Chamavani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of greeting each other as 'Michami Dukadam'.
In our sciences, SAMA VIRASYA BHUSHAM i.e. SAMA VIRASYA BHUSHAM.
The sorry man becomes hero.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, "It is the specialty of a strong man to forgive."
In his drama Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare wrote about the significance of forgiveness, "Mercy Is Tives Blusset, It Blusset Him Datt Gives Him Datt Text", the one who forgives and forgives receives the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated for ten days.
This festival is a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the festival of Ganesh.
Now it's time for a celebration in Kerala.
One of the brilliant celebrations of India, Onam is the main festival of Kerala.
This is of social and cultural importance.
Onam showcases the rich cultural east of Kerala.
This festival enhances the message of love and harmony in the society and brings new enthusiasm, new aspirations and new faith in the minds of the people.
Now this festival is becoming a fond of encouraging tourism.
In Gujarat, the Navaratri Festival and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become an attractive attraction for the fun in a way.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We need to think of what we can do on this subject.
Idul Suha will also be celebrated after a few days.
Festivals are a symbol of devotion and faith and we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of modernization are changing.
Various types of tests are conducted in every family.
See how big changes are, how pleasant changes are.
As I said, the whole country is full of intellectual awareness.
I'm very happy to know somebody about new innovations.
Somebody said that an engineer collected some specific soil and added it, so it was imparting training to build a Ganesh statue.
When he offers that Ganesh in a small basket of water, he gets dissolved quickly in water.
He didn't stop with that.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Mission will be launched and it will be three years on 2nd October.
Its results have started to be seen.
Toilets have increased from 39 percent to 67 percent now.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been released from external defecation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water rose, the waste spread everywhere.
We can create an atmosphere of cleanliness across the country.
After the construction of the toilet, you can add your name to the portal and the family who has helped you.
In this, you can write in different languages, no age limit.
You can make short films on your own mobile.
2-3 minute long short films that are inspired by cleanliness.
In any language, there can be a silent picture.
Take yourself a partner in this.
You will see how bright this October will be on Gandhi Jayanti.
After 15 days of sewerage, imagine how sacred will we enjoy to pay homage to respected Bapu when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October after the Swachhta Hi Seva programme.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my special commitment to you.
I'm waiting for your message with greater hope than you wait for Mann Ki Baat.
I'm eagerly waiting for every thing you say to me to learn something.
It's an opportunity to change the things I do.
I use your small things to think with a new perspective.
"Prime Minister, I'm speaking immaculately from Pune.
I once went to the mall with her for shopping.
She spent two thousand rupees for a sari, spent Rs 450 for a pizza.
But he argued with the auto driver who had to go to the mall about five rupees.
On the way back, the vegetables were bought and the price for it was 4-5 rupees.
I felt very bad.
We pay money at large places without questioning the price, but we argue with the brothers and sisters who depend on us for some money.
They don't believe them.
You must tell me about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful for making a great message through this heart-breaking phone call.
I am sure that if my people and my people take this habit in the behaviour of the poor, they will definitely leave it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August the country is celebrating Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey sportsperson, Major Dhyan Chand, who showed the light in Hockey.
His contribution to Hockey was sustainable.
I say this is because of the desire of connecting our youth with sports.
Sports must be part of our life.
If we think we are a young country in the world, our children should also be seen in sports.
Sports means Physical Fitness, Mental Alliance, Personality Enhancment.
What's more than that.
Sports are in a way an important medicine for the unity of minds.
The Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal to discover and enable young friends and talent.
Any child from all over the country, who has made some achievements in the sports sector, can upload video if he wants his personal identity.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to select the growing sportspersons.
Please tell the youngsters that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup will be run in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams from all over the world are going to make India their own home.
The enthusiasm and zeal of the six girls working in the Navy inspires us all.
These six girls came out to cross the sea in a small boat called INS Tarini.
It's called Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India all over the world after months.
This is the first time in the world that these six children will travel bravely in the midst of waves in the sea.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, we also celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
He was the President.
But he said he was a teacher himself.
He was a practitioner, a diplomat, a President of India who lived in every sense, was a enthusiastic teacher.
I love him.
Great Scientist, Albert Einstein said that this is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to awaken oy in creative exhibition and knowledge enjoying creativity and knowledge amongst his students.
This time when we celebrate Teachers' Day, don't we take a decision
Can we conduct a campaign like a mission
Teach to transform, education to mpower, learn to ear to ear change, learn to strengthen, learn to policy.
Can we take this mission forward with this determination
Everyone should take a decision for five years, guide them to accomplish it and be happy to achieve it in five years and succeed in life.
An atmosphere of this is to create our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions.
When we talk about change in our country, we will remember the teacher in the society as we remember the mother in the family.
Teachers have an important role in making changes.
Any event that has been transformed into life by comfortable efforts must have taken place in the lives of all teachers.
If we work together, we can play a big role in transforming the nation.
Let's move with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Honourable Prime Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in the city of Mumbai and works for the Harvard University's India Research Centre.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in economic inclusion schemes and related social schemes.
I would like to ask you whether India is economically safer after three years of Jan Dhan Yojana which started in 2014 and shows a stronger number of statistics and empowerment facilities are available to our women, farmers, labourers, villages and slums
The movement started on 28th August 2014 as a dream in mind.
On 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will last three years.
3 crore new families have been linked to this.
It is more than the total population of many countries in the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested about Rs. 60,000 crore in banks.
Today, the Prime Minister Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are giving birth to a new belief in the lives of those poor with a simple vision of one rupee or three rupees.
When the poor was in danger, when the prime minister of the family lost his life, some families got Rs. 2 lakh in a few days due to insurance of one rupee.
They will get inspired by it and hundreds of examples have come to me about how a scheme makes a change in the lives of a person, how it fills new energy and how it fills new faith.
They can interview such people and inspire new generations.
My dear countrymen, I once again wish Michami Dukad.
Thank you very much.
The speciality of human mind is that the rainy season attracts the mind.
Consequently, the changing climate and environment have adverse negative conditions.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, especially in Assam and North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people had to suffer from disasters due to heavy rains.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to assist the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, and citizens working with service morale are making maximum efforts to help people in this environment.
From the Government of India, all the soldiers, Air Force, NDRF and paramilitary groups are working with livelihood to help flood affected people.
Life becomes very complicated due to floods.
The NDRF team was appointed.
Climate warnings are nearly relevant due to technologies development and progress in environmental science.
If we decide the timeline for our activity as per climate indication, then we can save us from great harms.
When I get ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are preparing for it more than me and this time it is GST.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day, and I was very impressed.
Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) started this month.
I am very happy to hear that things are valuable and I feel very simple when I write a letter saying that a person living in the north-eastern regions, far-flung hilly areas, in the forests, was really scared that I was scared of luxury and now I started to understand things.
How much time is to come from one place to another, and how much the crowd on the highways is less.
Pollution has been reduced due to the rapid pace of tracks.
Goods reach the goals quickly.
The faster the simplicity of this transformation, the faster the transformation, the new registrations have taken place, the whole country has become a new belief.
However, I am confident that once economists, management experts, technologists and technologists will look at India as a model for the implementation of GST in the world.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a big change, with the participation of millions and millions of people in such a big country, it has successfully taken us to the peak of victory.
The world must learn about it.
All States have a role in implementing this GST and all States have the responsibility.
All decisions and decisions have been taken by the States and the Central Government together.
What a big dream of 'One Nation One Tax' has been achieved.
How the officers worked from the village to the centre, how dedicated they worked, how a cordial atmosphere was created between the government and the businessmen and the consumers and how they played a big role in enhancing their faith.
I heartily congratulate all the Ministries, all the departments and all the officers of the Central and State Governments involved in this matter.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias social power.
It's a history.
In a way, this is the initiative of social reform.
I once again salute crores of countrymen for making such a great effort successful.
My dear countrymen, August is the month of revolution.
The country became independent on 15th August, 1947.
In the month of August, several events are related to the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation must know what happened on 9th August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the people joined the freedom movement, tried and felt the difficulties.
We are inspiring to build a magnificent India.
Indias mindset united against English rule.
According to Mahatma Gandhi's call, lakhs of Indians were dedicated to the struggle with the mantra of 'Work or Death'.
Millions of youth in the country have observed their studies and observed books.
They got off after listening to the cry of independence.
On 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi called for 'Bharat Chhodo' but all the big leaders were put in jail by the English administration and at that time Dr.
The great men like Lohya and Jayprakash Narayan were the three pillars.
There were people behind all this victory, people had the ability, peoples determination and peoples struggle.
This effort, which took place from 1857 to 1942, took this fight to its jurisdiction in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the Englishmen had to leave India, which was drowned through 'Bharat Chodo'.
I would like to link you to its mathematics.
We got freedom in 1947.
Today is 2017.
For nearly 70 years.
The governments have come.
Successes have happened.
Hopes awakened.
As the years from 1942 to 1947 were decisive years to achieve the swearing-in.
From 2017 to 2022, five years have come forward to achieve the goal with determination and we will be able to celebrate the 15th of August 2017 as a pledge opportunity.
Crores of decisions.
Let's try to fulfil crores of decisions.
In that case we have to take a pledge.
2017 should be our dream year.
This August must be part of the vision.
It is not necessary to work or die today, but to join with a new India, to work with mind and body to achieve success, to live with this dream and to try.
In the next five years, we have to make a decision to be witnessed.
Social discussions can be organised for young organisations, student organisations and NGOs.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we get as a nation
What can I contribute as a person
With technologies, come forward with video, posts, blocks, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a mass movement.
uit India uis for the youth will also be launched in the Narendra Modi App.
This is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce the freedom fighters.
You must surely give a widespread propaganda to the people.
This time, I invite you to know your views on My Gov Apple or Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to talk about it as long as it is available on August 15.
I think it's about 40-45-50 minutes.
Dear countrymen, I would like to say one more thing today.
There is a socio-economic science in the economic system of India.
We don't ever look at it.
Our festivals and festivals are not only an opportunity to enjoy.
Our festivals and festivals are the efforts of social reform.
It connects individuals and society.
Thousands of jobs like Rakhis makers, Rakhis sellers and sweets sellers are associated with this festival.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn lamps to Deepawali - not just a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration or adornment of houses.
It is directly linked to the poor families who build soil chariots.
But today, when I talk about festivals and the economic values of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
I think when I see that the people of this country are more aware and more active than ever.
For the last one month, aware citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
They have requested that in Ganesh Chaturthi, the environment friendly Ganesh should be predicted and people should have an opportunity to plan to like Ganesh with soil.
I'm obliged to such aware citizens.
This time I'm telling you this.
I'm sure you will all be with me in this.
This will help its artisans and poor artists, and they will get jobs by creating idols.
The poor's stomach will be filled.
Come, let us connect our celebrations with the poor, connect with the economic condition of the poor, let us make the joy of our celebrations the economic festival of the poor, we must try to do this.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, be it the education sector in the country, be it the economic sector, be it the social sector or the sports sector, we are constantly watching our country's daughters at the heights and heights.
We, the people of this country are proud of our daughters.
Last day, our girls performed well in the World Cup by women cricket.
The pressure and tension appeared on their faces.
I've evaluated things in that conversation in another way.
I said, look, the hopes of the media are very different during this period.
Whether you win the game or not, you won the hearts of hundred and fifty five crore people.
The younger generation of the country, especially our girls, are actually working very much to enhance the glory of our country.
I once again congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our girls, and convey my best wishes.
Dear countrymen, I remind you of the August Revolution and remind you of the 9th August and remind you of the 15th August.
I recall the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
All the countrymen should take a pledge and prepare plans for five years for the dream realization of all the countrymen.
We have to take the country to new heights, to reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
Let us move forward with confidence that the future of the country will be bright.
Climate is changing.
Climate is comfortable due to heavy rains in different parts of the country.
Cold wind after the rains has been relieved from heat in the past.
Whatever is busy in life, in their own life or in public life, in tension, the rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and joy in different parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's chariot festival is being celebrated.
Those who learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar would have known that he praised Lord Jagannath's temple and the traditions there, because they include social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, a word 'Jagharnat' is known by a few people, which means a chariot that nobody can stop.
Looking at the meaning of this garden, this word has emerged from Lord Jagannath's chariot.
We know from this how the world has made this chariot of Jagannath in its own way.
The auspicious month of Ramsan was celebrated with sacred worship.
It's now Eid.
My best wishes to all on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramsan is a holy donor and is a joy sharing month.
On this auspicious month of Ramsan, I was inspired by an inspirational event in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters who come in about 3500 are living in that small village and in a way the sisters and sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population.
During this Ramsan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
17 lakh will be spent on the other requirements of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this auspicious occasion of Ramsan an opportunity for the good of the society.
Everything they do is inspiring.
The most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur open defecation free.
Our country has already been declared as Open Defecation Free States of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were announced.
I express my gratitude to these five states, to the rulers, officials and the common people.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits are part of our nature.
And I'd like to tell you that was a very good event last day.
Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh is an incident.
What was the goal
Construction of 10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen will be happy to know that the work of making 10,000 toilets has been successfully completed in 100 hours in collaboration with the common man and the government.
71 villages have become open defecation free.
In, through letters and airways.
Shriman Prakash recalled the time of Triple Tagore and presented the Fire on June 25 as a memorable remembrance of the dark period in the history of democracy.
This awakening of light for democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not only a system but also a culture.
The value of freedom is a constant awareness of the Eternal Guardians this Price of Liberty.
Continuous awareness is essential for democracy and therefore, it is necessary to remind them of the consequences of democracy.
And we must move towards the best things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable night of democracy.
In a way, the government was making the country a prisoner.
He suppressed the voices of opposition.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned in jail.
The justice system was not able to escape from the terrible shadow of the situation.
The newspaper was completely neutralized.
Students from today's journalists and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to enhance the awareness of the people of democracy by reminding them of that black period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem in a year after the announcement of an emergency, which he described in that poem as a mental condition.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is proud of the world today.
June 21, 2017 was the world meeting.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning.
Any Hindustani who is not proud of it.
It was not that Yoga was not before but when Yoga was engraved by the pattern of Yoga then Yoga became a glimpse of the world.
Most of the countries in the world have made Yoga Day an opportunity.
In China, people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level, at a height of 2400 metres in Peru, the world heritage of Machu Pichu.
In France, people performed yoga in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.
This programme was organised at 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a week long programme was organised.
10 stamps on UN International Yoga Day were released.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters
Officials from the United Nations and diplomats from all over the world participated in the event.
This time Yoga has once again created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people have made a new world record by doing yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our armed forces like BSF, ITBP, CRPF and CISF have made Yoga a part of work with their duty.
Some TV channels also promoted it.
The Honble Prime Minister said in Kerala in recent times that instead of of offering all the gifts at different places, good books should be given as a memorable gift.
This has started in Gujarat during your reign, but in recent times the use of bucks is more.
Can't you do anything
Can't we do anything to implement books instead of books all over the country
Khadiku said it would be Khadi's calendar to get encouragement.
As long as I was in Gujarat, the program continued, but after leaving there, I left the habit.
But I was once again aware of this programme in Kerala.
Now, there's a report on this.
Let's slowly make it a habit.
Buckey's age is too low.
Let's go after buying it in your hand.
Welcome to Khadi's calendar, however poor families are benefitted.
The cost will be less and it will be useful properly.
It has been so many years, but the queen of Elizabeth has kept the calendar of Mahatma Gandhi.
Several types of letters are available, many kinds of people burn.
I'm sure to tell you about it when I read a letter last day.
Aarulmozhi Shravanan sent me a letter to a family from Madurai in Tamil Nadu on the south.
Don't know what it was.
Considering the study of the children, he thought of some economic activity and thought that the family would have some financial assistance.
I took loans from the bank under the MUDRA scheme and started the work of buying some goods from the market.
That is, the Government departments will look after the registration of e-Jamm.
They're written to me very interesting.
They said, "I got the money under the MUDRA scheme, starting the business, added the list of what I can be given in e-jam and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, from PMO.
It was a new news for me too.
They pointed out what they bought at the PMO - two thermos were bought and received Rs. 1600.
This is empowerment.
This is an opportunity to promote industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, and has entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-Jam.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we can also honour our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is flagging not only on earth but also in the atmosphere.
Two days ago, ISRO-CartoSat-2 launched 30 NANO satellites with Series.
These satellites were from India and 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This Nano Satellite initiative of India will help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
A few days ago, ISRO GISAT 19 successfully launched.
It was one of the most heavy satellites that India has so far launched.
Our country's newspapers compare it to the weight of the elephant.
Our scientists can only imagine what they have done in the environment.
On 19th June, 1000 days of the Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
The Mangalyaan Mission was aimed at a total of six months when we successfully found the path of travel.
Recently, Indias Badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the pride of the country.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got the opportunity to interact with the inauguration of the Synthetic Track.
As much as we are associated with sports, sportsman spirit also increases.
Sports play an important role in personality development.
Sports has a great importance in overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
Children should also be encouraged by showing interest in sports in our family.
As the next Olympics, we all have to dream.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the frequent fervor of celebrations, all together this time is a new experience.
Once again, I wish you all the best wishes and I'll tell you some other things in the next Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of Malayalam Specific Broadcasting by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to the people of India on 28th May 2017 at 11.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan has started.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramsan, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the people of India and the world, especially to the Muslim community.
In Ramzan, prayer, spirituality and charity are of great importance.
Our country is a living country, who believe in God, who denies God, who denies idolaters, who oppose the idolatry.
We have the art of living together with all ideals and all kinds of worship and traditions of all kinds.
The message that gives us religions, castes, thoughts and traditions is of peace and unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramsan will help us move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again, I convey my best wishes.
I am very happy that a large number of people have made me feel their experience.
It showed me the zeal of telling you directly.
I can't read everything, I can't listen to everyone's messages.
But I saw everything together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn new words, some tried to learn some new things in the U Tube and try to learn new languages.
I'm very happy to hear a phone call.
I'm talking to Diksha Katyal.
I left my reading habit.
But during this holiday, I decided to read something.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, we realized how many struggles had to be fought to achieve independence and how many sacrifices were required and how many freedom fighters had been in jail for years.
I am inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has sacrificed a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation on this subject.
I am glad that the new generation wishes to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who laid down their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men left their youth in jails.
During the freedom struggle, the great men in the jails have done a lot of literary work.
Their gems strengthened the freedom struggle of India.
Years ago, once I went to Andaman Nicobar.
Cellular went to see the prison.
This is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Sarkar wrote a book Mashi Janmathe in jail.
The poems were written on the wall of the jail.
He was locked in a small cell.
A light and sound show running there is very inspiring.
People from all the states of Hindustan, who speak all languages, had sacrificed their lives in the Cellular Jail of Andaman with the auspices of 'Kalapani'.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
What is connecting with nature
Conservation of good land is to connect with nature.
Where is it better than Mahatma Gandhi's words...
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, "We should also take care of the unprecedented world" (One Master Care Aboud A World One Will Not C) i. e.
Nature has a power.
You must have experienced that when you get tired then how much energy will be fit if you put a glass of water on your face .
When we get tired, when we open the windows of the house, when we open the doors, we feel a new mood to breathe in the air passing through.
When we are in touch with these five eleven elephants, our body itself has a new spirit and a new energy.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care, we don't care about it.
Now, when you are in touch with nature, you must keep in mind if there is no new spirit within you.
Therefore, on June 5, the global initiative to connect with nature must be the initiative of each of us.
We are feeling the benefit of protecting our eastern ecosystem.
If we keep the environment safe then it will benefit the future generations.
May Atharva Veda be the most important guidance of the environment, we must recall that it has been created thousands of years ago.
Mother Earth is said to be mysterious.
It is said in the Vedas that the softness of ours is the cause of our land.
Earth is our mother, we are children.
In our country, many festivals and many worships are related to the environment.
Be it the educated, the uneducated, the inhabitants of the city, the village, the tribal community, the worship of nature and the love of nature is a part of social life.
We have to take it new words, describe it by describing new justices.
There are some factors from the States.
In most of the states, there is a big initiative in the field of tree plantation as soon as the rainy season starts.
Crores of trees are planted.
Schoolchildren, social organisations, non-governmental organisations and governments are moving forward.
This time also we have to encourage trees and contribute to it and dear countrymen.
June 21 is coming, June 21 is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, the fame of the 21st June Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world and connects people with each other.
On the one hand, many breaking powers in the world are distorted and India is contributing a great deal to the world.
Through Yoga, the world has been engraved on a pattern.
As the body connects the mind, the mind and the soul, today Yoga is connecting the world itself.
Two days ago, I had written letters to all the governments and leaders of the world regarding Yoga.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to Yoga and announced some awards.
Gradually took some steps in that matter.
I have received some opinions about this and I appreciate those who sent these comments.
It's very funny.
Grandpa, grandmother or grandfather, grandfather, parents, mothers, boys and girls, together with three generations to upload their pictures.
It will be an opportunity to give a new dimension to Yoga today and tomorrow.
Tomorrow, the picture will be tomorrow, and it will be a promise of a pleasant tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There are about three weeks left to be World Yoga Day.
This is a healthcare scheme in a way.
I invite everyone to be part of it.
When you gave me the responsibility of being a key servant, I got the opportunity to speak for the first time on 15th August at the Red Fort in Delhi, and I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I'm going to different parts of Hindustan.
What are some people doing, where are Modi going
I'm grateful to him for seeing this thing.
You'll understand if you hear this phone call.
Pramanam Modiji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
I see television and social media regularly that wherever you go, people take special care of hygiene.
In Mumbai or in Surat, people have collectively taken cleanliness as a mission.
Not only adults but also children have awakened about cleanliness.
Children who are blaming the dirty people on the road are connected to somewhere.
The media also gives great importance to it, and just a few days ago, I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
What is more pleasant than cleanliness is related to my journey.
We can have the habit of making the rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness will be a big deal.
It makes everyone happy and motivate who wants cleanliness.
When Modiji decides the journey, ask those who invite me, what level will cleanliness be at the place where I invite
How many tons of slaughter will you dedicate to me, and I'll decide whether I should come or not.
The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of of offering gifts, we have to say that it will eliminate the manufacturing of iron silkwords as a gift.
How many people can be saved from the disease.
What a great humanitarian thing
Looking wealthy, seeing these slaughterhouses as a resource.
It's not just ruined.
If we start seeing these slabs as wealthy, new methods of waste processing will come forward to us.
Young people associated with startups will also come with new schemes and will come up with new tools.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, has decided to initiate a big initiative in the field of sewerage with the help of people representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, on World Environment Day, about 4,000 cities of the country will be able to provide sufficient storage to collect soil and liquid waste.
There are two types of rats, one green and the other blue.
The liquid waste, peels of green vegetables, food residues, eggs and leaves are liquid, they should be poured into green pockets.
All this is beneficial in the field of farming and it is reminded of what is needed in green potatoes .
The second extension is to have unnecessary papers, iron extracts, glasses, clothing, plastic, polythene, frozen dubbs, rubber goods, etc.
Versova residents are the volunteers who took over the responsibility.
Brothers and sisters, today I would like to tell you that the Reasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir has become an open defecation free area in connection with the Swachh Bharat initiative.
I congratulate all the people in the Reasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, the calculation of the present government is going on everywhere in the press or in the TV channel or in social media.
Three years ago, you assumed me the responsibility of being a key server.
Several surveys were conducted, many polls were held.
I see all this as a healthy thing.
This three-year work has been changed in every way.
People from all walks of society analyzed it.
This is a very good way of democracy.
Governments should be accountable in democracy and the governments must calculate their functioning for the people.
I thank all those who have spoken differently, greatly.
Responsibility strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for the awakening nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of good and bad survey is on me as a common citizen.
As I said, I have an impact on my mind as a common citizen, that's important.
Two days ago, the Honble President, Honble Vice President, Honble Speech Gentlemen and all of them together released a study book on Mann Ki Baat, as a person, as a common citizen.
I am grateful to the President, the Vice President and the Speech Gentlemen, who have given importance to Mann Ki Baat for the time being discovered and gave importance to it.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat gave a new head.
Some friends also discussed me during the work of the book on Manki Baat.
He said that he would like to prepare a sketch on all the topics he talked about in Mann Ki Baat, and Akbar gave a art form to Mann Ki Baat to show his love without buying a copy of a rupee.
I'm grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, the next time when Mann Ki Baat speaks, the whole country will have rains, the weather will change, the results of the exams will come, the new study life will start... and when rains arrives, a new energetic, fragrance will spread everywhere.
In this environment, we will move forward with love for nature.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the people of India on April 30, 2017 at 11 a.m.
I salute my dear countrymen.
Whatever the curiosity of the children, the ambitions of the youth, the experience of the elders and the experiences of the adults, are being taken into consideration...
Observing usually, it is a people's habit to advise others.
On the train, if someone gets cough when he goes on the bus, he says, do this, do it.
Advice, suggestion is in our nature.
Earlier, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, I heard the voice of advice and learned something, then the team felt that it would be a habit for many people and that's why it was sending it.
But when we tried to delicately analyze it, we really got full of heart.
More than those who say these words, and those who try to come to me do something really.
They are striving according to their knowledge, strength, capability and environment to do good things.
I'm sorry when it comes to mind, these suggestions are extraordinary.
I was worried about wasting food in Mann Ki Baat last time.
This is an example of how things are being done with the cooperation of the society.
Today is the end of April, the last day.
1st May is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature itself has changed all the rules of sports.
Our country had to experience the heat of May-June this time in March-April.
Some people have sent suggestions regarding what to do during this summer, when they adopt people's opinions for Mann Ki Baat.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but it will be very beneficial to repeat it on time.
Many friends starting from Kartik are worried about birds.
They said that the balcony and terrestrial need to put water in the utensil.
Small children in the family are very enthusiastic about this.
If they take care of how to keep water, they'll go to the utensil ten times a day, if they keep a utensil, whether it has water.
Be careful if the birds are coming.
We think it's a game, but it's really a good experience to wake up the minds of the children.
He lived up to 103 years.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, the Bohra community has taken a big step to save the pimples through the Burhani Foundation.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed nearly 50,000 utensils to the world.
It got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Often, when the press giver, the milkman, the vegetables, the postman, etc. reach the household, we forget to ask if we want summer and water.
Young friends, I want to tell you some things.
Many of our younger generation are happy to live in a very comfortable condition.
Parents also grow them very safely.
But I would like to tell you as a friend how to be your holidays.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities...
Sometimes watching some things on TV or reading in the book, or listen to the experienced oneself... and feel the same...
May the experiment be sympathetic, let's get out of the comfortable condition.
If we are from a middle-class family, we are from a happy family.
You can't see the joy of sports in life before.
You wonder how big changes will happen in their lives when the children living in the society get the opportunity to play with you.
This experience will teach you a lot of things.
Let's go to the forests.
Sometimes heat groups will be organised and personality development sequences will take place.
There will be several development works.
Everyone will be busy in their world with the strength of technology.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
Another I said about skills, you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competitions.
It will be hard to buy the highest marks and go to a coaching class even during the holidays and will be in danger of the next examination.
However, we must keep in mind whether the humanity inside is without, whether it goes away from human gains.
Can we pay a little more attention to skill development
Stay away from technology and spend some time.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 readers of a new language, either Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati or Marathi or Punjabi...
Try to learn something you don't know, you must have some advantage.
New places, new cities, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a curiosity, understand, discuss with people, ask them... it's a different joy to see them.
Try and decide the place yourself.
Don't lose time for more travel.
I have to spend three-four days there.
Then go to another place and stay there for three-four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Share me the pictures where you go.
Share your experiences using Hashtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also made you a good opportunity.
The new generation has become almost free from the outlines.
They don't need money.
They are starting to believe in digital transactions.
Do you think you can do this so that you can earn money
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
You've downloaded the Bhim App.
Ten rupees will be deposited from the government to your account.
If 20 people get together one day, you can earn 200 rupees in the late time.
Businessmen and students can earn through this.
The project will be upto 14th October.
You have played a role in making Digital India.
You will be a guard of New India.
Holidays and opportunities for funding.
Introduce digital and earn.
Our country usually has an atmosphere of hate with the VIP culture.
However, I realized that it was so deep that even though the country's largest person, the government has decided that the government will not walk on the vehicle with a red light.
It has become a symbol of VIP culture in a way.
It is evident from the experience that even though the red light was on the vehicle, it was climbing to the minds of the people and intellectually became a VIP culture.
Now there's a red light, so nobody is entitled to the red light on the head.
I got a funny phone call.
People are worried about the red light.
The Government wants to talk about the red bican light prohibition.
I read in the newspaper and every Indian is VIP in line.
I'm very proud of it.
Thank you for that.
Instead of VIPs, EPI means Everi Person Is Important, everyone has importance.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to remember our history, our culture and our tradition again and again.
It will give us energy and motivation.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya, the 125 crore Indians.
We've been overwhelmingly reminded of it only for centuries.
Century may be very important for other countries in the world.
Through his own behaviour, he turned away those who were considered untouched by the society.
Thousands of years ago, he had played a role in entering the temple and successfully entered the temple.
How lucky are we for the birth of great men in our society to remove the evils of our society in all ages.
On the occasion of the 1000th Birth Anniversary of Ramanujacharya, we will inspire to awaken the idea of power in the organisation of social unity.
To remind Swami Ramanujacharyas memories, the Government of India will release a stamp tomorrow on 1st May.
Swami Ramanujacharya is respected and offered homage to him.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is another significance.
A few people would be aware that we are obliged to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect received by the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is memorable.
Today, while talking about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, the great Karnataka saint of the 12th century, the social reformer Jagat Guru Basveshwar is remembered.
Yesterday I got the opportunity to participate in a function.
I got the opportunity to release his speeches.
In the twelfth century, in Kannada, he has deeply thought of his hard work and those who work.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
This means that you can reach Lord Shiva's luxury dilapidated dilapidation through hard work.
I mean, by working, heaven can be achieved...
I'm often supposed to be Shreeva Jayate.
Dattopant Thangdi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie Group, often remembers the importance of employment.
It is natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi while talking about the workers today.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate the Buddha Purnima.
People from all over the world will celebrate it with Lord Buddha.
The life of Ashoka in India is an excellent example of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate to see that the UN is celebrating Vesak Day on this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This time it's going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to renew his memories.
Dear countrymen, an effort has been made to move forward in India with the mantra of Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas).
As Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas, it is not only in India but also in the global background.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capability of this satellite and its related facilities will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will be helpful in creating a framework of natural resources, in terms of tele-medicine, in the field of education, in terms of intensive technological connectivity, in terms of people-to-people contacts.
This is an important step in India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia.
Invaluable gifts.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice and a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhan.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore - his memories are traditional for us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also composed the National Song of Bangladesh.
One funny thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian who won the Nobel Prize in 1913 but also gave him a Nighthood status by the British.
However, Rabindranath Tagore was in the group of great men who had been killed by the British in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919.
It was a matter of deep impact on the minds of a child aged 12.
The child who laughed at fields and sports in childhood made a new inspiration in the cruel massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
The child who was 12 years old in 1919, Bhagath is the inspiration of all of us, martyr Bhagat Singh.
On March 23, Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British.
We know that even during the death, Bhagath Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were happy to serve Bharatamba and were not afraid of death.
All the dreams of life have been dedicated to the freedom of Bharatamba.
These three heroes still inspire all of us.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
As the British Empire, these noses were scared.
The prison was locked, the hanging was sure, but the British thought of what they were thinking about.
That's why on March 24, he killed those who were determined to hang.
They did it unusually without knowing.
Later, his body was brought to Punjab today and the British uninterruptedly burnt.
When I got the opportunity to go there for the first time a few years ago, I felt a specific tremor on that land.
I will definitely tell the youth of the country - if you get the opportunity, you must go to the graveyards of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Datt if you go to Punjab.
Freedom wisdom, its intensity and its propaganda was an increasing age.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
In the freedom struggle of India, the direct form of Gandhiji's thinking and his style was seen in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot assess the Satyagraha of Champaran on the basis of the form of Mahatma Gandhi.
A man who returned to Hindustan in 1915... for just two years..
It was just a beginning.
We can imagine how much he had to suffer at that time, how much he would have worked.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to identify Mahatma Gandhis organisational ability and the ability to understand the common man of the country.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his behaviour, organized the poorest of the poor and the illiterate in front of the British empire to fight, inspired and fought.
Champaran Satyagraha shows us this wonderful strength and we can recognize the glory of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha had done a satyagraha then it is a big study for any person who starts a public life.
This is the solid foundation of New India, the desire and effort to change the desire of 150 crore people for transformation.
New India is not a government vision, it is not a demonstrator of any democratic party.
New India is the urge of 155 crore people.
It is a vision of how a magnificent India can be built by hundred and fifty five crore people together.
There is an idea, an excitement, a vision, an aspiration.
Like the silent servants, they're doing it like penance, like things.
There are many who go to hospitals and help patients.
There are many running for blood donation as soon as you know.
If someone's hungry, there are many people who think about feeding them.
We can say that our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
People's service is God's vision.
If we look at it with social consciousness, how strong it will be, if we look at it.
When we talk about New India, we should think about it, we should analyze it, we should look at it with a different vision.
If 125 crore people decide, if they decide the path with determination, if they take steps one after the other, then the dreams of 125 crore people of New India will be realized in our eyes.
All this is not possible through the budget, through government schemes and government funds.
If we decide to observe transport laws, if all citizens decide that my duties will be fulfilled with responsibilities, all citizens will not use petrol or diesel one day a week...
These are small things and you will see the dream of a New India in this country with a hundred and twenty five crore people.
It means that all citizens follow their citizenship and follow their duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country have participated in a digital revolution called Digital Payments and have been keen on how to exchange money without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn it, and gradually people are moving towards transactions without currency.
Digital payments have been developed after the notice cancellation programme.
It took only two and a half months after the BHIM App, but by now, about one and a half crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against corruption and corruption.
150 crore people don't wait for it for a year if they want.
It can be done in six months.
We can do this in everyday life.
You will be the heroes of the fight against corruption and corruption.
Several Digidhan Melas have been organized to teach people and make people aware.
The scheme is to conduct 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There were also prize plans.
A total of 12. 5 million people have won the gifts for the consumers.
Seventy thousand people have won gifts to traders.
Everyone has decided to go ahead with this method.
April 14, 2018, Dr.
The Digidhan Mela is scheduled to end on 14th April on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb.
On the completion of 100 days, there's a big program.
There's arrangements for mega rubbing.
We can propagate BHIM App in the remaining days of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Please play our role in reducing the purchasing of a noticed payment of money.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that when Mann Ki Baat gets suggestions from people every time, but there is a need for cleanliness every time.
My best wishes to you all for the first time in winning this election with a large number of congratulations from Dehradun to Gayatri.
I want to tell you my Manki Bat.
I want to tell people how important cleanliness is.
I'm passing through a river every day, in which people pour plenty of slaughter and make the river dirty.
Brothers and sisters, Look, a child studying in class eleven is suffering from the pollution of the river.
How angry the child looks at the swords in that river.
I see this as a good symptom.
Since the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan, there has been a new awakening in the country.
The hatred of waste is also increasing.
Walk up, be active partnership, be born... it has its own importance.
I have to tell all those who listen to Gayatri in this Manki Baat today that Gayatri's message should be a message to all of us.
Everything that sees is filled in the plate, it's not enough to eat.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
In our homes, when mothers harvest the children, they say, "Son or daughter, take it for me."
Secondly, if it benefits a little, it is financially beneficial for the family.
It is a good thing to think for the society, but it benefits the family.
I'm not compulsory in this regard, but I urge you to be more awake.
I know the youngsters who do great things about this.
They've made a mobile app for this.
If you know that there is such a meal somewhere, people call and eat that food and use it well.
This work is the youth of our country.
We will see such people somewhere in all the states of Hindustan.
We can inspire their lives and food not to be neglected.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way to change.
Those who are cautious about health always say - keep the belly and a little empty, keep the plate a little empty.
When we talk about health, we should remember 7th April, the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UNHC) has set a target of health for all by 2030.
This time, the UN is focusing on the issue of depression on the 7th April World Health Day.
We also know the word of depression, but if the word means it is called depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
The creation of a psychological atmosphere begins to salvation.
The first mantra is to open it rather than to stop depression.
Tell friends, parents, brothers, teachers what your minds are.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children living in the hostels, will have more difficulty.
The nature of our country is that we are living in our family and we have a big family and mutual interference, which reduces the chances of depression.
Otherwise, not when everyone goes out together, I don't come, keep in mind if you want to sit alone.
Give him a chance to be with those who can speak openly.
Smile and motivate him to talk to him, bring him out if it's difficult inside.
It's a good way.
Depression causes physical and mental disorders.
Like diabetes is the master of all kinds of diseases, depression also makes all the capabilities of fighting, fighting and deciding.
If you don't open your minds in front of your own people, you can seek help from anybody who is serving nearby.
Help your mind, share your happiness.
If you try to understand the grief of someone else, if you do it with a sense of service, there will be a new self-confidence in you.
If you are associated with others, helping someone, serve with selflessness, you can reduce the weight of your mind and the weight of your mind.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in liberating stress, elimination of mental stress and a journey to joy.
21st June is International Yoga Day.
Last day, the Government of India took a big decision.
It should be welcomed that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day.
The family's responsibilities and the family's economic responsibilities have to be played because of these things, injustice has to be done to newborns.
Therefore, the central government took a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
Dear countrymen, on 5th April is the holy day of Ramnavami and on 9th April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men inspire us and empower us to pledge for a New India.
Two days later, the Chaitra Shukla statue, the year's representation and the New Year is coming and many good wishes to you all in this New Year.
This is the beginning of cultivation after spring and this is the time when farmers get the results of their hard work.
This New Year is celebrated in various ways in different parts of our country.
New Year is being celebrated in the name of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Cheti-Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Sanvatsar Puja in Awadh region, Jud-Cheetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadh.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all this new year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the Malayalam Speech by Akashwani to the people of India at 11 a.m.
After the leafying, new leaves have started coming in the trees.
Flowers bloom.
Gardens and gardens are greenery .
The chirping of birds starts attracting the mind.
Not only flowers, but also sunlight shining fruits are seen in the branches of trees.
The flowers of mango, the fruit of summer, start to appear in spring.
Amir Khusro's leather has described a very funny moment of changing.
Amir Khusro writes: Phul Rahi Sarasom Sakalban, Ambava Phute, Tesu Phulekoyal Boley, Dar-Dar, when the flowers of flowers sing on the summits, when the skin becomes pleasant, the man also enjoys his pleasure.
Spring Panchami, Mahashivaratri, Holi festivals are all filled with joy in human life.
Shoha Jalan wrote on the Narendra Modi App: Many people do not know about the achievements of ISRO.
So they say that information about the launch of 104 satellites and the interceptor missile should be spread.
Shohaji thanks very much for reminding India of its prideful achievement.
Technology and science have marked its role in fighting poverty or escaping diseases or connecting with the world or getting knowledge.
February 15, 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise India's head in front of the world.
We all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the past years.
ISRO has established a world record in Shunyakash last day after its success in reaching Mangalyaan on Mars.
The ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites from various countries like USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Egypt and India to the air.
India is the first country in the world to create history by bringing together 104 satellites to the environment.
It is a matter of great happiness that PSLV has been successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the history of India.
The cost-effective and efficient environment mission of ISRO is astonishing all over the world.
The world has complimented the success of the scientists of India with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is the most important.
We've drawn some pictures as soon as our satellite arrives.
It's starting its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that our young scientists and our women scientists have led the entire leadership of this mission.
The role of youngsters and women is an important component of the success of ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO in the name of the people of the country.
They have always aimed at bringing environmental science to the common man for the service of the nation and have always put new towers in their crown.
India has successfully tested the Balistic Interceptor Missile in the security sector.
You will be happy to know that only four or five countries suffering from the world have achieved this.
Scientists in India showcased this.
Even if India's target is 2000 km away, the missile will destroy it in the space itself.
We are happy to see new technologies and new scientific techniques.
Curiosity has played a major role in the development of humanity.
Efforts are constantly being made to know the universe, creation and human minds.
New science and new technologies are born from it.
All technologies and all new forms of science are giving birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists, and often I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should increase the spirit of science.
The country needs many scientists.
Today's scientists have become the cause of a new change in the life of the future generations.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "No science has broken from the sky in a sufficient form.
All sciences are developed and built on experiences.
Revered Bapu further said, "I deeply reflect the enthusiasm, dedication and dedication led by them in the discovery of modern scientists following truth.
Science seeks to utilize the principles for the purpose of the common man, what the media should be, what the technology should be, because it is considered to be the most important contributor to the common man.
Identifying, exhibiting such innovations, providing information to the people, how such innovations should be beneficial for the common man, how more manufacturing can be done and how commercial use can be done.
Sometimes the problems show the importance of science to find solutions to it.
All the arrangements are in line with technologies.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
Digi Dhan Yojana was of great importance in the past.
In particular, the younger generation has become a habit of doing digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good news.
In the last few days in our country, Laki Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Business Yojana have received a lot of support.
For nearly two months, 10,000 people have been awarded a day.
Through these two schemes, the beginning of transforming digital payments into a mass movement in India has been accepted all over the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have received a prize of Rs.
More than 4,500 traders received the award of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small businessmen and other employers, Grihanaths and students are enthusiastically participating in this programme.
Asked if only youngsters or adults come, the award winners have 15 years of age and 65-70 years of age.
Shri Anandji in Mysore is happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he got a thousand rupees prize under the Laki Grahak Yojana.
And then I thought they had a thousand rupees I received, and I gave them that thousand rupees.
I am very happy, pleased with your name and your work.
You have done inspirational work for everyone.
A young friend in Maharashtra is also a Puja Nemade Post Gradeshwat student, who shared his own experience with others that how much they are using RuPay Card e-wallet in the family and how much they are enjoying using it.
Lakki Grahak Yojana on completion of 100 days, Dr.
Babasaheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
The Prime Minister said that on April 14, a major award for crores of rupees is going to take place.
Now there are forty-five days left.
You can't do this by remembering Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was over.
Recalling him, you also teach at least 125 people to download 'BHIM App'.
Teach how the purchase of money is going on, especially the nearby small traders.
This time, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, give special importance to the Bhim App.
We have to go home and reach BHIM App to 125 crore hands.
In the last two-three months, this campaign has achieved a lot of success in many townships, in many villages and in many cities.
The farmers of our country have produced food grains that will improve the record this year.
Our farmers have revised all the records of the past.
It seems everyday that seeing the crops in the farming fields, Pongal and Vaishakhi are being celebrated today.
This year, more than two and a half million tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
The farmers of my country heard the voice of the poor and cultivated different paddy cultivation in about 290 lakh hectares of farming.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, a function of senior officers from 23 States was organised in Telangana under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Water and Sanitation, Government of India.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's a proven thing.
If there is a standard doubling toilet for a six-year family, it is filled in about six years.
After that the waste can be left back to the second pit.
In six to twelve months the dirt of the pit is completely digested.
It is very safe to handle such degraded waste, and it is very important for NPK as a fertilizer.
Farmers know the NPK fertilizers well.
Nitragen, phosphorous and potassium are very nutritious, which is considered to be the best fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
Others must have taken such steps as the government has taken this step.
Several departments are being organized regularly at the government level.
In the first week of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, in collaboration with the Ministry of Tribal Development, is going to strengthen the Swachhta mission.
In the second quarter of March, two Ministries - Ministry of Water Transport and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation are working together to pursue Swachhta Abhiyan.
We all know that even if any citizen of our country does good, the whole country will reach a new height and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends.
I believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable and determined, brave and emotional.
We'll get to learn anything from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or environmental science, women in our country are not behind anyone.
The country's name is brightening the achievements.
Our women won the silver medal in the Asian Ragbi Service Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to those players.
The World Women's Day is being celebrated on 8th March.
Today, it is not only a government programme.
The thinking of the people has changed over the years of old customs.
It is a pleasure to hear the news that the birth of a girl has turned into a celebration.
In a way, positive thinking with girls has become a cause of social recognition.
In the Gudallur district of Tamil Nadu, it was found that child marriages were stopped through a special gathering.
So far, about 175 girls have been able to stop marriages.
According to the Sukanya Samridhi Yojana, the district administration has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000-60,000 girls.
Under the Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all sections have been associated with the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, along with organizing rural households, the district government is making several efforts to ensure orphan girls' education.
Under the Housing Visit of Harghar Dastak in Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organised in every village and every household for the education of girls.
Rajasthan, our child, our school - Apna Bacha Apna Vidyalaya, has implemented a programme to inspire and re-graduate the girls who have been educated in school.
In fact, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has taken several forms.
I see this as a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, 2019 August
On the one hand, when our country enjoys rainy season, on the other hand, there are festivals or fairs in every corner of India.
This will happen till Deepavali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have decided to create a cycle, economic and social life, in any environment, there is no difficulty in the society.
In the past, we celebrated several festivals.
Everyone can find solutions to today's problems from Srikrishna's life.
In spite of all such importance take the work of Sarathi in the battlefield .
Sometimes pick up the mountains, sometimes cut the leaf of eating.
I mean, Krishna feels a new thing in all things.
So, when I talk to you today, I'm paying attention to two favourites.
One is the Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan and the other is the Mohn.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan left the Yamuna coast in Gujarat and lived on the sea coast of Dwarka and Mohn, born on the sea coast, reached Delhi on the banks of the Yamuna at the last time.
We can learn from the message of Lord Krishna, whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling at every height of life.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
New Kirti Pillar has been established and has given a new path to human history.
The service, the spirit of service, the duty of service was always a part of Mahatma Gandhi's life.
In his own life, he made an example of service.
Mahatma Gandhi's individuals, society, humanity and humanity.
Whether it is the Financial Family in Africa, the Tolstoi Family, the Sabarmati Ashram or the Wardha, he always emphasized the need for social gathering in his own different ways.
I am fortunate to believe that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can tell you that Gandhi had given importance to organizational awareness with the spirit of service.
We have to bring the feelings of social service, social growth and social organisation in our practical life.
In fact, this is the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and the real Kashianjali.
There will be a lot of opportunities like this and we will gather together.
But what is Gandhi 150
What can we share in these efforts as a person
Think of what value addition can be done alone.
There are ladies clubs.
Let us continue the work on the modern Ladies Club, but let all the members of the Ladies Club work together.
We can do a lot of things.
Old books shaping, distributing to the poor, spreading knowledge.
130 crore people will have 130 crore resolutions and 130 crore initiatives will be launched.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
During the freedom struggle, the salt satyagraha that took place in Dandi was a great path.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to travel to any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
Wherever it can be - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Ashram of Wardha and some other related to Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures on social media and others may inspire.
This time, Venice presented a very interesting exhibition on Gandhijis memories at the Indian Pavilion in Binale.
Among them, Haripura panels were specially attractive.
You will be reminded that in history, the event of the Congress convention held in Haripura, Gujarat and the Presidential election of Subhash Chandra Bose was held there.
These art exhibitions have a beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Convention of Congress, in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Principal Nandalal Bose at Shantiniketan Art Bhavan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and showcase his artwork at the MahaSammelan.
With this artistic constitution, Nandalal Bose has also been revived.
Nandlal Bose visited the villages near Haripura and finally showcased the lives of rural India.
These valuable artworks have become a big discussion in Venice.
Once again, with the best wishes of Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary, I urge all Indians to take a pledge.
For the country, for the society, for somebody else, something has to be done.
This will be a good, real and meaningful task to see Bapu.
My dear countrymen, for the last few years, we have been organising a programme of waste-free service across the country for nearly two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on 11th September.
Plastics should be given special importance this time.
On 15th August, I reminded the people of the Red Fort that how enthusiastic and enthusiastic the people of 155 crore people had organized a mass movement for waste defecation and worked to get rid of external defecation.
Likewise, we need to stop the use of single use plastic together.
There is a lot of enthusiasm for all sections of the society in this regard.
Many of my brothers and sisters in the business sector have put a board in front of the shop and wrote that those who come to buy it should bring a bag.
This will also benefit the money and help them play a role in protecting the environment.
This time, when we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Baba on 2nd October, we will not only dedicate to him an open defecation free India, but will also lay the foundation stone for a new mass gathering against plastic across the country.
Let's make fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji
Dear people, our cultural languages are in a way enlightened.
We'll get out of that what we want in our life.
I would like to say a big thing through a cultured translation.
Even though it was written centuries ago, it is still very important.
It's a very good language - Prithviya Trini Ratnani Jal Mannam, Subhashitam Mui, Pashanakhandeshu Ratnasanjya, that there are three rituals on earth like water, food and subhashitam.
The foolish people call the stone ratna.
There was great glory in our culture.
We have also changed the knowledge about that.
Awareness about the requirement of nutrition is making the country massive through modern scientific methods.
People fight against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Accordingly, in the days of crop production, the Anganwadi servants collect each grain from the people.
These cereals are used for making hot food for children and women.
After this, the person is dedicated to this objective and becomes a soldier of the masses.
We must have heard of an event called Annaprasham in every part of India in our families.
This is the first time that children are fed rice.
Not liquid, thick food.
At some places people donate food.
On the occasion of birth anniversary, on the occasion of birth anniversary, on the occasion of memorial day, the people of the family make nutritious food, nutritious food and take them to Anganwadi or school, and gives their own fertilizers to children.
They share their happiness and share others.
It is a good coordination of the spirit of service and happiness.
Friends, there are many such small things that can be successfully fought against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of knowledge about nutrition and malnutrition, the poor and the rich are suffering.
The month of September will be celebrated throughout the country as a nutritional month.
You must be part of it, add something new, and your role will be in it.
It means that if you can protect someone from malnutrition then we can protect ourselves from malnutrition.
In the past weeks, I went away, all the people saw 'Man vs.
However, I have never thought that there will be an opportunity to touch the minds of the youth around the world.
What's happening
I went to Bhutan last week.
As Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go from me to wherever I have got the opportunity to go, since then, I have somebody asking me about Yoga for about five and a half minutes because of being celebrated on International Yoga Day.
There is no big leader who didn't talk to me about yoga in the world, and this is my experience all over the world.
The Discovery Channel is scheduled to translate into language in 165 countries.
I am confident that this episode of the Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world about Indias message, Indias tradition and natural sympathy in Indias cultural journey.
Today, people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and clean environment in our country.
Did you shoot several times
"It's very curiosity.
Look, there's no secret in it.
I'll open my secret because many people have this question.
Or it's not secret.
The truth is that technology has been used efficiently in interaction with Bir Grills.
Whatever I say, the interpretation was going on in English and he was listening through a small instrument that had no bleeding in the ears of Bir Grills.
I mean, even though I was in Hindi, he was listening to English, so it was easy to speak, this is the technological miracle.
After this show, some people spoke to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You and nature must go to places related to wildlife.
I have said this before, I have to go to the north eastern part of India.
I have to spend some time there.
Dear people, the thinking and anxiety about the environment in India, that is, the idea of preserving nature is naturally visible.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release the country's Tiger Senses.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, it's only half of it.
The Tiger Summit was organised at St. Peters Burg in Russia in 2010 on Tigers.
A decision was taken by expressing concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
It was decided to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India and we are at a rapid pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers in 2019.
The number of tigers in India has doubled the number of conserved areas and community reserves.
In the jungle of Gir, we took several steps one after another.
In 2007, we decided to appoint women guards there.
Infrastructure has increased to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about protection.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
We have a very good advice in our sciences.
Listen to what has been said in our sciences centuries ago, the Nirvana Vadhyadey Vaaghro, the Chhiddhe Vantasmad Vaaghro Van Safety, the forest area is not bridged, that is, if there is no forest, the tigers are forced to come among humans and are killed.
Dear people, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
This Indian young monk, who has captured humanity all over the world, has established a shining personality of India in the world.
On September 11, 1893, the words of a great man like Swami Vivekananda made the world obliged to change India's vision.
Come, let us try to live with the real strength of India that Swami Vivekananda saw, the form of India, and the real strength of India that Swami Vivekananda saw, and everything is within us.
But I don't cross the details.
Wait till August 29.
We will all strive to get rid of plastics everywhere in the house and outside.
I am confident that this campaign will be filled with social fabric.
Come, let's move with a new zeal, new determination, new strength.
Let us move forward by showing the inner joy with a sense of service.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the Malayalam Specific Broadcasting by Akashwani to the people of India at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen, I am greetings to all.
Our Republic Day was celebrated on 26th January with joy and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
This is a cultural festival of Indias Constitution, citizens' duties, citizens' rights and our commitment to democracy, which makes the future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities and culture.
However, in our country, there is no depth of discussions on the duty of citizens, the rights of citizens, the depth of discussions and the widespread discussions.
In two minutes, it shows social vision, determination and respect for the martyrs.
Everyone has a natural respect for the army and the security forces in our country.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families who have been awarded with various bravery awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Can you do something for me, especially for the youth, who are very enthusiasticly intervening in social media
On the one hand, when we were happy to hear the celebrations of 26th January, the brave soldiers of our army from the security of the country came to Kashmir.
I pay homage to all those heroes, I bow down to them.
My young friends, you know very well that I make my mind clear regularly through a program called Mann Ki Baat.
The months of January, February, March and April are the time for examinations in every family.
When I came to know about this matter, many teachers, parents, students messaged me, asked me questions, suggested, pained and mentioned the pain.
I would like to share with you the thoughts I had in my mind after seeing all that.
I got a telephone message from a child called Creation.
Listen, the creation says, "Sir, I want to tell you that at the time of examination, there is a very scary atmosphere in our homes, neighbours and society.
Because of this, children have to be motivated instead of encouraging.
Those who are happy with the exams are very few.
Exams for most people are an opportunity of stress.
That's what happens in us, that's what's coming out.
It is a feeling of strength on the occasion of the festival of the society.
The best appears.
At the time of the examination, the entire family must form a festival between friends and neighbours.
You will see the pressure turning into a plussor, the pressure becomes happy.
Festival will make the mind weightless.
Look, there's a change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kachch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months are exams.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the most calm mind.
If you're tensed, all the doors are closed, the outside doesn't come in, the inside doesn't come out.
There is a hindrance to the thought process, and it becomes a burden.
I say in my experience that if there is mental tension, we will forget, if there is peace, we will remember things that we cannot imagine, it will be very beneficial.
The problem isn't that you don't know, it's not that you didn't learn to work.
But when you are stressed, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are suppressed and your mental pressure is suppressed.
Looks like life is a problem.
I'll think you're going to write the exam for a year-long study.
P.
J.
If he had been disappointed because of that failure, if he had failed to live, if he had found such a great scientist or had he found such a great President
Therefore, the competition has grown and there has been an increase in mental tension among the students.
Mark and Mark Sheet have limited use.
It's not all in life.
It depends on how much you got to know about your life.
If you believe in these things, the Mark Wall will squeeze after you, you will never have to follow the Mark.
You have knowledge in life, benefiting from skills, benefiting from self-confidence and definite benefit.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
So the weight of the Mark prevents us from going on the right path.
But if you take care of the Market, you'll slowly limit you to certain things, just to be guaranteed.
This is a very psychological fight.
In fact, the competition is not useful for leading life and it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How's the day going to be better than the last day
How's the chance to come better than one thing has happened
Sometimes you've seen it in sports, and you'll understand it quickly, so I'll tell you an example here.
The specialty of their lives is that they compete themselves for the most victorious players.
Didn't you feel sleepy because of the tension of the exams before, are you sleeping now
Second, you're worse than him.
Third, it's equal.
Keep in mind how to do better than you did earlier, how to do more than that.
Beautiful parents have expressed their views on the role.
He said the role of parents in the examination is very important.
Because mothers are more cautious about the future of children at home, the work is continuing, they simplify many things.
If you learn to accept it, most of the problems will end there.
That's why I want to tell the parents that you're doing this to the children sometimes.
Did you feel that in the days of the examination, children should be given an eye of laughter
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very funny phone call came.
Because I did something like that in my childhood, I tried to copper once in my childhood.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways, and I lost a lot of time.
"It's right to say that.
When sometimes there is no faith in your capabilities, I'll look at the next one I'll check if I'm written right.
Perhaps we're right to write, it's wrong to write the next one.
Looking at it, we'll write it wrong to ourselves and lock our own hole.
I mean, it's not much beneficial for copper.
It's a kind of liar, so don't do it.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
I am angry with the Prime Minister, the children are asked to play at the time of the examination.
It is usually believed that if the student focuses on sports, it shows carelessness in learning.
This understanding is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If you want a comprehensive development, you must understand that there is a life outside the books, it is very large.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to make life.
This is the maintenance.
In my vision of the exam, three things are important: right rest, second sleep for the body, third intellectual activity, and a large part of the body.
Therefore, the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing the trees and plants and enjoying your heart while sitting in front of you
Long breath brings a lot of tension.
There is no need to stay in the room for long breathing.
Some people think they'll sit late in the night and learn more - it's not right.
You must sleep for the body.
So you don't lose time to learn.
A folk singer who came to see me about it asked, how long do you sleep
I asked you back, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing the election, your locking voice is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, you'll get a comfort for your vocal code.
He gave me a big medicine that he didn't think of sleeping and vocal code and my voice.
It doesn't mean only if you sleep.
So don't do that.
If possible, do it, don't do it...
Or this will be a burden, and I also join your parents in your family to advise them not to be weighed.
Remembering your determinations, put your trust in your capabilities and go to the examination.
My best wishes.
Festival of examinations to win all examinations.
And the exam will not be exams.
Move with this magic.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
Coast Guard has ranked 4th largest coastal forces in the world with 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
The Coast Guard remains uncomfortable in the opposite environment of the Jawans to protect the maritime coasts and coastal environment of the country by making this ideal meaningful.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans took a big target of cleaning the coastline of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people participated in it.
It is a matter of appreciation that they have thought of coastal safety and hygiene.
Very few people must know that not only men, women and women have successfully fulfilled their responsibility in the coast guard of our country.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard not only work as pilots and observers, but also control over the hovercraft.
Today, the maritime security is the most important subject in the world, and hence, those who are engaged in the valuable work of coastal security of India pay hundreds of years in the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard.
On 1st February, the spring is the festival.
The spring is considered to be the best tuba.
Spring is known as the king of thorns.
Vasant Panchami is the festival of Saraswati Puja in our country.
It is believed to be an opportunity to worship learning.
Not only this, it is a celebration that inspires the heroes.
Merra Rang de Basanti Chola is an inspiration.
On the auspicious occasion of this spring Panchami, my best wishes to my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat Akashwani is giving new forms to them in their own way.
Since last month, after my Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat has started listening to local languages.
I once again congratulate Akashwani for this thing that they started with self-reliance and congratulations to the people of the country.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
Hundreds of good wishes.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "The poor don't want our favour, but our recognition."
St. Luke specially says, "Ishoo has not only served the poor but also appreciated the service of the poor." This is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because the others gave a lot, but the widow gave them all their service today, December 25.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to start several development works in Malaviyaji's penance land in Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohana Malaviya Cancer Care Centre at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre that is being built there will be very beneficial not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand, Bihar.
Today is the birth anniversary of our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Atal ji's contribution to this country will never be forgotten.
Under his leadership, we have succeeded the nation in the field of energy.
As a party leader, as a Lok Sabha member, as a minister and as a Prime Minister, Atal ji established a great ideal.
On Atal ji's birth anniversary, I salute him and pray to God for his health.
As a worker, I got the opportunity to work with Atalji.
Several memories are showing up.
I have shared an old video when I wrote this morning, and I can see how I got the privilege of getting Atal ji's love for a small worker.
Today Christmas is going to get the benefits of two schemes to the countrymen as Christmas Prize.
In a way, the project has been started on the second day of November.
Cashlessness among the people of the country, whether the village or the city or the educational or the illiterate, how to make cashless payments, how to buy goods without RuPay, there is an atmosphere of ambition all around.
Everyone wants to learn and know each other.
To promote this, to strengthen mobile banking and to become e-payment habits, the Government of India is launching the Promotion Schemes for consumers and small businesses today.
This is not just a day, but this project has started from today to 100 days.
Every day 10,000 people get a thousand rupees prize.
You will be eligible for digital payments like mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI and CSD for hundreds of days.
The Digi-Dhan Business Yojana is mainly aimed at traders.
This scheme is aimed at all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Therefore, those who buy more than Rs. 5000 and less than Rs. 3000 will get this award.
Those who buy goods for more than Rs. 3000 will not get this award.
The poor people will be able to buy goods, sell goods and pay money through Feature Phone, ordinary phones, using FSD, so that they can be the beneficiaries of the scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the award scheme.
If you ask them that the youngsters nearby will know these things, I know they will tell them everything, and in your family there will be children studying 10 or 12, and they will tell them all beautifully.
It's simple as you send warts up messages through mobile phones.
Dear people, how to use technology, how to make e-payment and how to make online payments, knowledge is expanding rapidly in the country.
In the last few days, cashless trade has increased 200-300 times, i. e.
Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
This decision is how big it can be imagined by the business community.
Digital Payments traders are also encouraging online payments instead of notice in their businesses and also provides remuneration on income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Somebody said that the Assam Government has decided to repay 10 of the discount if the goods tax and license fees are closed digitally.
The shares of rural banks will receive a reward of Rs. 50,000 from the government for at least two digital transactions between January and March, with 75 of their transactions.
5 lakhs in accordance with the scheme for Digital Transformation (DTT) to the villages that have 100 digital transformation by 31st March, 2017.
They also announced the Digital Krishik Shiromani Scheme to the farmers, which will provide 5,000 rupees to the first 10 farmers who are fully digitally making payments for purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
In this context, I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the governments for this kind of initiative.
Several organizations have adopted several successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the village.
GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GNFC) focused on fertilizers has set up thousands of POS machines at Fertilizers Marketing Centres for the convenience of farmers and has given 5 lakh charities to 30,000 farmers within a few days through digital payments.
In comparison to last year, GNFCs fertilizer sales have increased by 27 percent.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youngsters have made great progress in startups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies and new schemes, our youth should give the importance to this region as much as possible.
So, we can participate in the effort to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, every month I ask people first in Manki Baat to share your opinions and tell you what to say.
Out of the thousands of opinions received by MyGov and Narendra Modi App this time, 80-90 per cent of the fight against corruption and black money was about the withdrawal of money, and when I saw everything, I felt that there would be a total of three types of impressions.
Some have explained in detail about various difficulties and inconveniences of people.
Another group writes that such a good thing, for the good of the country, for such a sacred thing, how many falsehoods are going on, and what new ways of faith are being found.
I am grateful to the people for writing so many letters and helping me.
The feeling of Gurumani Kevel's writing appears in every corner of the country.
We all recognize it.
Who will be a man who doesn't suffer when people are suffering and suffering.
I have the same pain as you have.
I clearly know that if 10025 crore people stand with them, nothing is impossible, and people are the image of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I thank the people for taking part in this great sacrifice against corruption and black money. I bow down to the people.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is an individual or an organization or a political party, everyone has to follow the law and follow it.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money are trying all the time to find the government's shortcomings.
This government is for the common people.
Continuously trying to know the opinions of the people.
People see what is the problem, what is the cause of the law and what can be solved.
As a timely and sensitive government, how many laws have to be changed by taking into account the comfort of the people, the aim is to reduce the sufferings of the people.
On the other hand, I told you that this is an extraordinary fight.
Over 70 years, how many powers have been integrated into bankruptcy and corruption transactions
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight against such people, they are also developing new methods every day to defeat the government.
When they adopt new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
I'm gonna make ten if you put it, because I'm gonna make the corrupt, the thieves, the thieves without black money.
On the other hand, there are letters from many of whom frauds are going on and how new methods are being discovered.
In this context, I would like to convey my heartfelt congratulations to the dear countrymen.
The number of information in the government system is multiplied from ordinary people.
Success often happens because the common people are awake.
Can anybody imagine how many awakening people in my country are challenging to bring such psychological powers to light
The third group that writes the letter is too much, they say that Modiji should not be weak, do not stand, how hard the footwear can be, the outward situation should now be targeted.
I would especially like to thank those who wrote such letters because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out and made a strong 'Benamy Property Act'.
In the coming days, the law will start working for it.
Whatever is done for the good of the country, for the good of the country, it is a priority.
In Mann Ki Baat last year, I have said that in the midst of these difficulties and in the context of agriculture, our farmers have improved the record of last year.
It is a good information about the agriculture sector.
On the last day, India has been proud of the world economics in many fields, and as a result of the continuous hard work of our people, India's rise in global rankings is being seen through different indicators.
The World Bank's Doing Business Report has improved India's rank.
According to the Global Investment Report released by Dutch, India has ranked 3rd in Top Prospective Host Economics for 2016-18.
India has ranked 32 in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016, and the Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank has increased 19 ranks in 2016.
While assessing other reports, this is the same way that India is moving at a fast pace.
But in this situation, some good things are going on sometimes.
The Government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally tried to speed up this move.
My objective was to achieve the empowerment and dignity of the disabled.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters became stronger for our hard work and faith when we won four medals in Paralympics.
They not only raised the pride of the country through that victory, but also wondered the people with their capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are our invaluable wealth and strength like all the citizens of the country.
I am extremely happy to note that after the passage of this law for the good of the people with disabilities, the opportunities for the people with disabilities will increase.
Government has increased the reservation limit in jobs to 4.
The Act envisages specific departments on education, other facilities and complaints of Divyangjans.
The sensitivity of the government in the matter of Divyangjans can be imagined from the fact that in the last two years, the government has organised 4,350 pillars and has distributed equipment to 5,90,000 brothers and sisters with disabilities at a cost of Rs. 352 crore.
The government has enacted a new law in line with the wishes of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangs were seven kinds of people.
Thalassemia, Parkinson and Lizard are also involved in this group, my young friends
Over the past few weeks, news from sports was proud of us.
It is natural that we all feel proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team has won a number of four years against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were commendable.
Test Captain Virad Kohli gave good leadership along with good batting.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering of the Indian Cricket Team, Mr.
The junior hockey team signed the World Cup.
The junior hockey team wins the World Cup after 15 years.
Congratulations to younger sportspersons for this achievement.
This accomplishment is a good wish for the Indian Hockey team.
Our women wondered last month.
India's women hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy, and now a few days ago, India's women hockey team won the bronze medal at the Under 18 Asia Cup.
I heartily congratulate all the players of cricket and hockey teams.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
In the last month we were celebrating Deepavali.
Some wrote poems, some brought pictures, some brought cartoons, some made video.
I mean, how many houses were turned into military posts.
I'm surprising to see how emotional and visionary I see these letters still.
With all your partnership, the book is being prepared by giving you your commitments to the army of the country and your vision to the security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Prime Minister ji, all the festivals like Holi and Deepawali will be held on the border for the soldiers.
Every minute the idea of the country's security is imbibed.
However, on the occasions of celebrations, there will be remembrance of the house.
But the truth doesn't happen this time.
It's a celebration, not a house.
We also felt that we were celebrating Deepawali with 1. 55 crore Indians.
When the nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago, the princes of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to be seen.
They were the people of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in Kashmir valley.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a while.
But when the conversation grew, it was quite natural that the situation in the valley, the law and order and the future of the children had passed.
I am very happy to note that all those villages that came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise given to me.
They went to the village and alerted the remote people.
A few days ago, when the board examination took place, about 95 of the children of Kashmir participated in the examination.
Our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to take new heights of development through education, for a bright future.
While addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, it was said that a great step is being taken to bring about changes in the country.
The more important thing should be implemented with the same importance, I felt that in our normal life there would be a lot of difficulties.
I had said that it would take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and it would be so big that we should return to normal level only after 50 days.
This decision is being taken carefully by the world and all the economic experts are analyzing and assessing it.
25 billion people of India are seeing whether they will succeed with difficulty.
There can be a question mark in front of the world.
25 crore people of India have a great respect.
It is believed that this decision will win, and our country will prove to be like gold.
The liberal is the citizens of this place, you are none of you, and you can lead this path of victory.
All the components of the Central Government, State Governments, Local Local Bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank officials, more than one and a half lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends are working with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of mental tensions, all of them are quietly deemed to be a national serviceman and are working as an effort to make a great change.
Starting in the morning, we don't even know when the night is over.
The officers of the bank and the post offices are working without such difficulty.
If the matter of humanity comes, they seem to be two feet ahead.
A warrior accident took place in Khandwa
Immediately needed money
I was very happy to know that when one of the officers of the bank took care of him, he himself went to the heroine's house and provided the money for treatment.
Such numerous stories are known everyday through television, media and newspapers.
The poor are enthusiastic and enthusiastic and invest in their accounts, or they are doing something else and trying to save black money.
But please don't play with the poor's life.
He said, Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
Madhya Pradesh is from Tharali village in Tharali Taluk district of Harda.
It will give people enthusiasm and it is very important for the undisclosed economy of nation building.
I'm with the country in this regard.
And I am very happy that you have followed the action of a thousand and five thousand people.
I would like to thank you in my heart because nobody thought you would take such a big step when you said Dad Ayenge.
Anchur and thousands of people followed and taught good lessons to black people and corrupt people.
Every Indian citizen cannot have a good day.
People from different countries of the world have also learnt to talk about Chai Pe Church.
But I didn't know the wedding would take place in the Chai Pe church.
I came to know that on 17th November there was a marriage with Chai Pe Church in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who came to her marriage.
There was no procession, there was no food programme - because of the withdrawal of slaves, there was a bit of difficulty for money.
In a toxic, people find better ways.
People are finding their own ways.
You saw this change.
Big people with relations, who don't think they're going to ask you, they don't pay properly, their dwellings will be very much left.
If all municipalities get 50 per cent of their hands.
But this time, due to this decision on the 8th, all of them ran away to shut down their old architectures.
In 47 cities last year, 3,000 crore rupees were locked in this period.
It's surprising and pleasant to hear you, and this week it's worth Rs. 10,000 crores.
There will be many such examples that have a direct impact on it.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong reflection of the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economic system, all citizens are fighting with it in the midst of difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is a significant progress in providing loans to them.
Under the Mudra Yojana, lakhs and crores of rupees have been given to such small people because crores of people are doing these small businesses and making businesses faster for crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have difficulty under this decision.
However, now our small businessmen are serving the consumers through technology, through mobile apps, through mobile banking and credit cards, on the basis of trust.
I would like to tell these small businessmen that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
Download the banks' up on mobile phones.
Put POS machines to use credit cards.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technology can be developed in the entire business of your village.
Don't let anyone cheat you.
You, young men in my country liked my decision, I know.
I know you're supporting this decision.
I know you're very contributing to taking this matter forward effectively.
Friends, you're my real soldier, my good friends.
This is a wonderful opportunity to serve mother India and this is an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
Your family doesn't know the Jews, parents, father-in-law, uncle-mommy.
You know what the up is, you know what online banking is, all knows how online ticket booking is.
It's normal for you, you use it.
But today, the country wants to do a great thing as a society-building without an eye.
It's true that a hundred percent and a society without an eye is not possible.
But can't we become a slightly visualized society
If you start building a little sighted society once, the creation of a society will not be far away.
You know what opportunities are available for the undisclosed society, digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facility.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
All the banks have their own wallets.
Walter means e-pers.
Various types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families in India have RuPay cards.
The use of RuPay card, which was very little used, has increased by 300 times after 8th.
Prepaid cards are available to spend money from the bank like a prepaid card in the mobile phone.
Not only this, technology is simplifying that there is no need for a big smart phone.
I have stressed on making these arrangements easier.
All the banks try to do it.
My young friends, despite all this, there's a great generation that cannot be known.
I am very well aware that all of you are working on this great thing.
I see the creative messages given by you in the Wats App - printings, poems, short stories, cartoons, new ideas, sports jokes.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this.
Your mobile phone will have all the technologies to spend online.
Not only this, every day about half an hour, one hour and two hours, how to use this technology, how to download the app of the bank, how to spend the money in your account, how to give it to the debtor.
Once you teach people how to use the RuPay card, the poor will bless you.
Teaching all this to the ordinary people, they may get rid of all the grievances.
I don't think if all the youngsters of India engage in this regard, it will take more time.
Within a month, we can present a new India before the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, go to ten houses every day and connect ten houses with it every day.
I invite you, come, not only support, but we can be a soldier of this change, change and rest.
We will take this war forward to eliminate the country from corruption and black money.
The country took a revolution.
My dear youth, I once again urge you to take this mission forward.
I urge all schools, colleges, universities, NCC and NSS to do this together and separately.
We'll take it forward.
We have got the opportunity to serve well for the country.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
You must have seen that the most renowned artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Abhiyan, is leading a very heartfelt initiative.
So, he remembered the birth anniversary of his father as well as the birth anniversary of his father.
He wrote a line of poems by Harivansh Rai ji: "Man body, joyful mind, an invisible life, that's me.
Cleanliness yajna flows like blood in the nerves of his son Shri Amitabh Ji.
He has written to me through the poems of Harivansh Rai Ji - Swachh Bharat, Swachh Bharat, I am.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji with respect.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and happiness in every corner of India.
India is a country that celebrates any festival in any corner of the country on 365 days.
We have seen the courage to end untimely festivals.
The changes in festivals are naturally adopted as per the requirements of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
All these things were linked to our ancestors in a scientific manner.
Today, the world is discussing the environment.
Whether trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, there were festivals responsible for all.
That is, in our country, there was a tradition of celebrating vacations with Brahmanda and Science.
Today, when we celebrate Deepawali, as I said, this festival also brings knowledge and knowledge.
This Deepavali gives a message to Tamaso Maa Jyotirgamaya to go from darkness to light.
All parts of the house are cleaning the weight.
We have to make this nature and tradition a little broader and broader.
Deepawali is no longer in the border of India.
If there is no one in all the countries of the world, it remembers and celebrates Diwali in another way.
Many governments and parliamentarians of the world are participating in the festival of Deepawali.
Whether eastern countries or western countries or developing countries, Africa or Ireland, the festival of Deepawali can be seen in the United States.
Canada's Prime Minister, Deepawali, has been shared in the film.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom organised a gathering by connecting all the communities to participate in the Deepawali celebrations in London.
What's on that picture
The Prime Minister of Australia has called upon the people of various cities of Australia to participate in the Deepawali celebrations along with the greetings of Deepawali to the Indian community.
The Prime Minister visited New ealand last day.
He said he had to return quickly to participate in the Deepawali celebrations.
This festival of light, Deepawali, shows that this festival of light is becoming an inspirational festival to bring the world from darkness to light.
Appeal to parents is that when the children break their children, the elders should stay closer, take care of the obligations and avoid the danger in their minds.
In our country, the festival of Deepawali is a little longer.
Celebration of Chhath Puja in the eastern parts of India is a big festival.
If I talk about Deepawali or talk about Chhath Puja, it is indeed an opportunity for all of you to be greeted.
But it is also an opportunity to express gratitude to the countrymen and not to express gratitude to the countrymen.
Our soldiers are dedicated to our peace and peace because of the events that have taken place for the past few months.
When we all celebrate Deepawali, our soldiers are suffering from all kinds of difficulties, some in the desert, some in the peak of the Himalayas, some in the summit of the Himalayas, some industries and some protect the airports...
How many responsibilities are
Words, birds, thorns, colors, innumerable feelings...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I am glad that the truth is because you are funny, I say that because of my independence and the gift of happiness I sleep quietly because I sleep quietly because you are the mountains and the architecture of India bow down to you, the same way I bow down to you as well as I bow down to you as I bow down to you.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani gave me a message on telephone with her parents' house and husband's house with soldiers.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
- Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking to Shivani Moon.
With the launch of this programme 'Sadesh to Jawan' for Deepawali, our soldiers get a lot of encouragement.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
The officers on the border are getting good messages that are encouraging and all of them in the Army Circle are encouraged.
With the Armed Forces and Solgiers, their families and their wives are making a lot of sacrifice.
In a way, there is a good message for the military community and I wish you Deepawali.
My dear countrymen, we will see the soldiers standing on the border, not only on the border but on all sides of life.
Whether natural calamities or dissolution of the law and order have to deal directly with the enemies, the courage to bring the wrong youth back... our soldiers are working with nationalism in every field of life.
First Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be on 1st November.
The name of his village is Bandhana.
He arrived there and there was a discussion on the construction of toilets.
Some families have not been able to build toilets due to financial difficulties.
He said that the Swachhta Abhiyan has been strengthened by providing Rs. 1000 to 57 families from their pockets.
It has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defence Free.
In the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is a tribal village that has not been able to walk throughout the day.
People don't go there.
Cadets, senior officers of National Service Schemes and engineering students will come together to set up toilets.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
It's just what I said.
I congratulate all the citizens of these states for their contribution in the participants of this important thing and in the darkness of the country.
My dear countrymen, the schemes of the government will be very much and after the first scheme one such scheme will have to leave the first scheme.
But generally nobody takes care of these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always guided us all.
You decide according to this criteria.
We need to face the arising hopes of the poor in the country, which is the need of the hour.
Now there are toilets for girls and boys in schools.
It is no longer possible to make 20th century and still dark in the village.
Therefore, the programme to provide electricity to the village from darkness has been successfully moving forward.
5 crore households are trying to provide a sewage free life and are moving towards success.
Small traders, small businessmen, vegetable traders, dairy sellers, labourers etc. were caught in the grip of robbers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successful programmes for elimination of robbers.
Direct deposit of money to Aadhaar Lude Bank and eligible persons to get direct money
This is an opportunity for the common man to get rid of middlemen.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great men of this country, who have enlightened India's unity.
On the one hand, 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb on the one hand and the birth anniversary of a living great man of unity of the country.
I think he succeeded in it and he united everyone together.
On the same day, Indira Gandhi was slaughtered and we can say that the destiny of the country is diversity or unfortunate.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lived for unity, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, a brutality of the Sardars, and a painful one of us in history.
Stay away from the thoughts of different tribes and actions of different tribes and protect the country from it.
The journey of Sardar Saheb's life started in a fight for the farmers.
He was the son of a farmer.
Sardar Saheb had an important role in bringing the freedom struggle to the farmers.
Now we're listening to the name of Abul.
Even today, people from outside India and India have experienced all the products of Amal, but some people know that the co-operative milk products have thought of the Union as a result of Sardar Saheb's divine vision and the Kheda district was then known as Kera district.
In 1942, he laid emphasis on this thinking.
We are in front of us in the form of Anul, the comfort and prosperity of the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with respect.
On this solidarity day, on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb wherever we are.
My dear countrymen, Kartika Purnima is a glass of this festival of Deepawali.
The knowledge and teachings given by Guru Nanak Dev is a guide not only for Hindustan but for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty and good for all.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was a co-operator when there was a lot of disorders with ethnicity and ethnicity here.
If we want to move with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas', we will have a better guidance than Guru Nanak Dev.
I salute Guru Nanak Devi on the occasion of this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once again in the name of the soldiers of the country, on this occasion of Deepawali, my best wishes to all of you.
May your dreams and visions succeed in every sense.
May your life be comfortable and peaceful.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the people of India on September 20, 2016 at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen, I bow to you all.
In the past, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I bow down to these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
This loss is not only for those families who lost their son, lost their brother and lost their husband.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We're honoured in our army.
Traditionals and political leaders have a lot of opportunities to speak.
All parents want all schools and colleges to start playing well.
They also want their crops and fruits to reach markets in India.
That is, I want economic business to be right.
Over the past few days, the business has started to go well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, our progress and the path of development.
For our future generation, we need to have new heights of vision.
I am confident that we will find peace together for all the problems and prove to be the right way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the traditions of Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The administration will have to take some steps to enforce the law and order.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of our day-long powers and laws is for peace, and the common man of Kashmir is for a comfortable and peaceful life and they should follow our security forces in the right manner.
Sometimes, those who think differently from thinking, have new ideas.
I get the opportunity to know a lot of things from social media in the near future.
It gives an opportunity to know and understand the feelings of people from every corner of India, which enhances the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harsh Vardhan of the 11th class presented a different thinking before me.
He wrote, I felt very sorry after the terror attack in Uri and had a great desire to do something.
But I don't know what to do.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative vision.
But when the 1965 war took place, Lal Bahadur was a scientific scientist who led us, then there was a zeal, anger and patriotism.
Everybody wanted to walk something, thought to do something.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji has done a great effort to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Scientist showed that there would be ten other ways to show patriotism between the sounds of the bomb and the gun.
When Mahatma Gandhi was leading for freedom, when he was strong and when he felt a step forward for the struggle, he used to adopt that power in a very effective way to bring it back to creative things in society.
Let us and the army fulfill their responsibilities, let the rulers perform their duties, and if we make a creative role with the spirit of patriotism, the country will certainly attain new heights.
Dear countrymen, Shri T.
Karthik Narendra Modi App has written to me, the athletes who went to Paralympics have made history, their performance is the victory of human consciousness and human spirit.
Not only both of you, but also our sportspersons who participated in Paralimbics in all over the country have taken a feeling of emotion.
Perhaps, Para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have changed the vision of mankind and the vision of Disability.
I won't forget the words of our victorious sister Dipa Malik.
When he won the medal, the sister said, I failed the disability through this medal.
These words have great power.
This time, in Para Olympics, there were 19 lights, including three women from our country.
In comparison to other sports, the sports of persons with disabilities are more than physical capabilities and sports skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won four medals with the biggest achievement so far - two gold, one silver and one bronze and the second in Paul Volt and 12 years later.
He was losing his hand due to the electrical damage.
Think of a man who won the gold medal at the age of thirty-three years and won the second gold medal at the age of thirty-three years.
Mariyappan won the gold medal at Thankwellu Hijamb.
Thankwellu lost his right at the age of only five.
Poverty and his determination are not hampered.
He's not a man living in a big city, a middle-class family.
Whether it leads a life full of sufferings or physical difficulties, it has won medals for the country with determination.
If it's Light Deepamalika, it's rocked and rocked a variety of winners.
Varun C.
Bronze medal at Bhati Haizamb.
It is important that in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, we have inspired us to look at the disabled brothers and sisters.
Our sympathy should be awakened, and our vision for these Divyangjans should also be changed, and some people know how much performance this time in the Paralympics.
A few days ago, the Olympics competition took place at the same place.
Is there anybody thinking that even the Recads of the Public Olympics have improved the disabled
This time it happened.
In the coming days, India is trying to create a smooth scheme for Para Olympics and for its purposes.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people who were present there... and people were surprised.
I got the opportunity to release a book, which collected success stories in the life of some Divyangjans.
It was very enthusiastic.
I believe that establishing world records in the land of Navsari in India is a very important thing.
In eight hours, 600 persons with disabilities were able to get machines for those who could not hear.
It got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has stepped up 1005 crores towards cleanliness.
We have been able to see what is going on in the right direction and how good the result is and what is going on with a little effort.
Therefore, every ordinary person, administrator, administrator, a office, a road, a bus stand, a railway, a school or a college, a religious institution, a hospital, from children to adults, every poor village and every woman plays a role in cleanliness.
Friends of the media also played a creative role.
In order to respect the health, the dignity of the traditions, especially the mothers and sisters, it is necessary to finish the shrine of the shrine at an open place.
Therefore, Open Defecation Free (ODF) and Open Defecation Free (ODF).
A healthy competition is being organized in the villages of the States and States.
The States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will soon succeed in the path of liberation from the habit of open defecation.
Come on, let's move firmly.
I would like to introduce a scheme in front of young friends, especially in the recent times, using technology in large numbers.
What is peace in your city about cleanliness, everyone has the right to know, for which Indians have given a number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019 we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call this number 1969, you can understand the condition of construction of toilets and apply for construction of toilets.
You're gonna benefit from it.
Not only this, a Swachhta App has started to know about cleanliness related grievances and resolving the grievances.
You use this much, especially the new generation.
Indians have requested the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor young professionals who want to pray for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is related to cleanliness and cleanliness is essential for it.
It must be part of the waste wealth.
Therefore, we must turn to the West to compost with the Swachhta Mission.
Fertilizer has told companies to buy composts produced from waste.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers from all over the country, Mayors from the great cities and commissioners are going to make a profound discussion about cleanliness and sanitation.
What can we do with technology
How to generate employment through this
All these subjects will take place.
I see new news about cleanliness.
I have been told in the press recently that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and made awareness about the construction of toilets.
A team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh travelled from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar in 2800 AD and spread a message of cleanliness.
Every department in India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I urge each other to interact with these departments without interference in their respective places.
Currently, there is a survey of cleanliness.
Initially, 73 cities were surveyed and sanitation standards were presented to the people.
Now there are 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
With this, this time we will be behind and the next time we will be able to do a little better in every city.
This is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October.
It's been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission started.
This will also showcase the light of Deepawali in the poor's house, this time October 2 and Sunday.
You cannot be a participant in removing the waste that day, for 2 hours and 4 hours directly participate in it.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadurastri, we will determine to do something carefully for the nation.
To commemorate the Joy of Giving Week in various cities from 2nd to 8th October, 2018, the Vice President will commemorate the Joy of Giving Week.
It is a movement to collect food items, clothing, etc. to the needy.
The Pandit, Deendayal Upadhyaya's centenary year, starts today.
He has contributed to the universal and universal, Antyodaya Siddharam.
Mahatma Gandhi was also talking about the welfare of the person who stood at the last corner.
How can the poor get the benefits of development
Let us focus on how the poor get the benefits of development.
I salute the Honble Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya ji, who was inspired by all of us and empowered by our spiritual heritage.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
I've tried myself not to be a programme to celebrate the work done by Mann Ki Baat.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme of political confessions and extraditions.
How am I inspired by the common man in this country
I mean, Mann Ki Baat is not a discussion 15-20 minutes ago, but a new opportunity for social transformation has increased.
Anybody's more happy than that.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the people of India on August 21, 2016 at 11 a.m.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Hockey Mantrikan Dhyan Chand on 29th August.
He played a significant role in winning Gold in Hockey for India in the Olympic Games in 1928 and 1932 and 1936.
All those who we love cricket, have heard the name of Bradman.
He mentioned about Dhyanchand, he said that He Scores Golds Like Leakings (He gains goals like he takes sermons).
Dhyanchandji Sportsman was a living example of spirit and patriotism.
Once in a game in Kolkata, a opponent hit Dhyanchand's head with hockeys.
So there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dr. Dhyanchand said that in 10 minutes, three rounds were opened and replied with rounds.
My dear countrymen, when the time of Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions on MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
It's diverse.
But this time everyone has expressed his desire to say something about Rio Olympics.
I look very optimistic that the Prime Minister of the country urges ordinary citizens to have such a close and awakening approach to the Olympics.
In the field of non-cricket sports, the citizens of India have so much love and enlightenment.
Our daughters have once proved that they're not behind anybody.
It seems that girls from all over India are taking up a mission to make India a part of India.
The summit Takur wrote in Migov that we could have done better in Olympics.
He wrote, "Greetings for the first time on winning two medals in Excellency Modiser, Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
The society still considers sports as a waste of time.
It's necessary to change this thinking.
There is a need to increase the enthusiasm of the society.
Nobody can do this better than you.
We can't deny that we couldn't do something like we wanted.
In some ways, our sportspersons have performed well in India, but they have not been able to expect the good performance shown here.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if we don't get the medal, we can see that in many ways, our films showed a good performance.
Well, in shooting, Bindraji reached fourth place and lost his medal in a very small difference.
This is what happened in Tennis in the case of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
We have performed well in Athletics.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar won the eligible for track and fields.
It is a matter of great pleasure to know that after 36 years, the women's hockey team reached Olympics.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men reached Hockey and reached out stage.
Our team is strong.
Many sportspersons, such as Aditya Ashoka, Datu Bhokanal, and Das.
But, dear countrymen, we have to do a lot of things.
But if you do what you do, perhaps, we'll be disappointed again.
Let's prepare a framework for how we can be better.
The project should be formulated at a far-reaching vision of 2020, 2024, 2028.
The state governments should also create such committees and think of what we can do in the sports sector and what we can do to each of our states.
Select one or two varieties of States to show strength.
I urge sports associations that they should be carelessly analyzed.
I urge every citizen of India to give me a view on the interests of Narendra Modi App.
We're fully ready.
Dear countrymen, September 5 is a teacher's day.
I have spent several years on Teachers' Day with students and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot from small kids.
September 5 was a teacher's day and a teaching day for me.
But this time I have to attend the G-20 Summit, so I decided to express my feelings in Mann Kibat.
The teacher has the same place as the mother has in life.
I have seen teachers who are more concerned about their own people than their own.
They offer life for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, there are discussions about Pulela Gopichand all around.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand, his penance and dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in all our lives.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Survey is the birth anniversary of Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates this day as a teacher day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because our heroes were teachers in our small village.
Even today he seems to teach me in the classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me the Curspondence Course today.
It will be surprising that if he sees his handwriting at the age of nineteen, he writes such beautiful letters at this age.
My word is very bad and if someone sees a good word, I feel very respectful.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Ganesh is coming closer.
Ganesh changes the breakdowns... not in the lives of our country, our society, our family and everybody.
Lokmanya Tilak, who started the Jana Ganashotsav, made this religious festival an opportunity to awaken the country.
Even today, Ganesh Festival is going on not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
Every young man is making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very excited.
Some still strive to adhere to any feeling of the world.
They discuss public matters, conduct scripts and conduct flowers events.
In its views, the topics touching the society are presented in a artistic manner.
In a way, Ganesh Festival is a major initiative of public education.
The worldmanya Tilakan Swaraj gave inspiration that it is our birth-right.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festival gives a new life to the lives of individuals and society.
Life is impossible without festivals, but it has to be built according to time.
This time some people have specially written to me about Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Don't use Ganesh ji made of soil in the pond of the village.
The statues made of Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment.
He and many others have suffered a lot.
I also urge you to make idols of Goddess Durga and go back to our ancient traditions.
Ganesh is a slaughterer.
That's why we shouldn't create a dissolving Ganesh.
I don't know how much you'll accept it, but it's not just me, some say.
Several such institutions work very hard to create soil-made Ganesh.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also social service.
There is no serious damage to the environment because it is made of a shoe of the river in the lake and it merges into it again.
My best wishes to all of you on Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will declare Mother Teresa holy on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used the entire life to serve the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud that Mother Teresa, who has served the poor throughout his life, is getting a holy status.
The Government of India is also holding an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore people at this function on 4th September.
We can learn something from saints, sages, saints and great men.
We're getting something, learning, doing something better.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement, there is a huge change.
Jan Shakti is considered to be another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has successfully tried to clean the Ganga with the help of five State Governments to connect people to the clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, a meeting of the Chief Ministers of the village on the banks of Ganga was called in Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this idea.
I express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers of those five states in the name of the great Kalwaipe in cleaning the Ganga with Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and I have a special respect in my mind with those ideas.
On 15th July, more than one lakh students from more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collected letters to their parents.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in that letter that they wanted toilets in their homes.
They asked for that, some people wrote that this year they didn't celebrate their birthday, but it was sure to make toilets.
This is our inspiration.
A 16-year-old girl from Kopal district of Karnataka, Malma, who has committed a satyagraha against her family.
The family had no financial potential.
The child stood firm in power.
The Chief of the village, Mohammad Shafi, has arranged for Rs. 10,000 and made toilets within a week.
The power of the girl named Mollama and the chief of the village like Mohammad Shafi are congratulating.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is a dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have aimed at this.
This information will be available on the website.
The winners will be awarded on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October in the short film competition.
I have to tell the TV channels that you should also urge you to make such a film and compete.
Creativity and sewerage will be strengthened, new seals will be available, new methods will be known, new motivation will be found.
All this will be done through the participation of people and common artists, whether it is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Many people may feel that the President will inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still live with the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Betar will share their programmes and people from both sides of the Bangladeshi language will enjoy the Akashwani programme.
Akashwani's contribution in creating personal relations is very big.
The President inaugurated the event.
I thank Bangladesh for their cooperation in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to Akashwani for their share in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, you could have given me a prime minister, but I am also a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart more.
Such emotional events create new energy and motivation, which inspires people of India to do something.
He salutes crores of mothers in India who have been trying to help others with their own hardships.
My dear countrymen, we have suffered due to failing last year but the month of August has become difficult due to continuous rains.
Some parts of the country have been flooded again and again.
The State Governments, the Central Governments, the Regional Freedom Institutions, Social Institutions and Citizens have tried a lot to do whatever they can.
However, there were some other news about the floods that had to be remembered.
The month of August of this year will be reminded of what the strength of unity and how big changes can be made if we move together.
The GST Act has been passed by all the parties in the country, with a strong political legitimacy in August 2016, with no opportunity to counter each other, almost 90 parties across the country and all the parties in the Parliament.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is the example of how big it can be done if all the parties gather together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country together talked about the incidents and situations in Kashmir in a single voice.
I believe in the strength of 125 crore people.
This morning I got the opportunity to spend with some young people from Delhi.
I believe that in the coming days, all the young people of the country will be filled with the zeal of the Olympics Games.
The whole world will drown in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons anywhere.
I will surely send messages to the sportspersons on the website Narendra Modi App.
Come, let us all come together and try to enhance the dignity and soul of all of us and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, when you talk to you about Rio Olympics, a student of Punjab Central University, who is interested in poetry, will send a poem to me.
There will be many other poems like this, they may have written such poems, some may have written it now, some may have done musical discovery of poems.
I would like to share with you the poem that Suraj gave me.
The young man, Shriman Angit Karke, reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Shri Angli has been inspired to write what steps your government has taken to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be led by technology.
If someone tries to capture it, then it will appear in new dresses somewhere far away, and if we want to collaborate with technology, we must be united to move ahead.
Therefore, we can also adopt research and innovations as the components of technology.
Innovation, periment, entrepreneurship, etc.
If we initiate the second generation of innovation then our children will join it.
That is why the Government of India started the Atal Tinkering Abs.
The programme will provide assistance of Rs. 10 lakh to the schools which are part of the programme and another Rs. 10 lakh for the next five years.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
If we are able to build self-sufficient incubation centres, we can create a system for innovation and innovation to conduct tests in a systematic manner.
Construction of new incubation centres and renovation of old age is essential.
We have to face many problems in everyday life.
The mind wants to recover quickly when the disease comes, so eat some antibiotics.
You'll be able to get rid of it for a while, but you must stop taking antibiotics without taking advice from the doctors.
We don't eat antibiotics until the doctor writes.
We don't travel through such a cruise.
And this war will go ahead and make new medicines, scientific research, etc.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we must always be cautious in this regard.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
The doctor will tell you to eat 15 pills and eat it in 5 days.
The pills should be finished as long as the doctor's advice.
If you eat more medicine than required, it will be beneficial for the microbes.
Therefore, how many days the pill course the doctor suggests, it's a big thing to follow.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow the rules of use of antibiotics as well.
Our government is committed to protecting antibiotic registers.
You might have seen a red glass on the tops of that place where you have given information about antibiotic medicines sold today.
I urge you to take care of it.
I would like to add one more thing to health.
I'm worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
During pregnancy and subsequent deficiency of blood, reproductive infections and high blood pressure cannot be told when the problems of their life are destroyed.
This is the reason why the Government of India has been implementing a new mission that means Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maternity Yojana for the past few months.
Under this mission, all pregnant women are provided free check-ups at Government Health Centres every month on 9th.
I urge the Gynaecologists mainly that one day in a month i. e.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear countrymen, today the world is worried about climate change, globalization and environment.
Social discussions are going on in the country and in the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
In the Kurukshetra battlefield, Lord Krishna discusses the trees.
Shukracharya has also said that there is no vegetation without medicinal properties.
The man who donates the tree also drives the tree to the world like his fountains.
Therefore, the parents who want their own good should grow good trees and preserve them like fountains.
Whether it is the Gita or the Shukracharya or the Anushasana Mountain of Mahabharata, some people who live in these ideals are in the present generation.
A few days ago, I noticed a daughter from Pune, Sonal, a gentleman.
It touched my mind.
The festival of Mahabharata says that the tree is fulfilling the responsibilities of the people all over the world, Sonal has taken a mission to fulfil the aspirations of his parents and the society itself.
Kisan Khandu Mahatra, a village named Narayanpur in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, has inspired his granddaughter Sonal's marriage in a very inspirational manner.
I saw its pictures in social media.
I didn't see people in Varun's gathering at the wedding, but rather the plants were only visual.
The scene that touches the mind was in that picture.
Sonal is a gradual graduate, the idea is her own.
You will see how great nature love has been shown by the gift of Mavitai to those who came to the wedding.
On the other hand, Sonal's marriage has become an uninterrupted story of natural love and I wish Sonal and Shriman Mahatrajee the best wishes for this innovative effort.
This can be transformed into a natural population of the tree.
The Government of Maharashtra has decided to plant about 1. 5 crore trees across the state on 1st July this year and set up 3 crore trees next year.
It is not simple to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan will understand how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has decided to increase its greenery by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat also has a bright tradition of the Van Mahotsav.
This year, Gujarat has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees by offering several names like Maav forests, unity forests and martyrs forests to the Van Mahotsav.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was just a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela in the memory of South Africa.
When we hear the words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoeni settlement and was known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence Sarvodaya.
I was fortunate to travel from Peter Maritburg station on a train that had travelled to Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to say that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have hosted for equality and equal opportunities in our entire youth and society.
They fought with Nelson Mandela with his shoulders and spent their lives in jails for 20-22 years.
I am fortunate to see the great friends of Nelson Mandela, Shriman Ahmad Kathatta, Shriman Lalu Chiba, Shriman George Besos and Rony Casirils.
Even after such a great penance, there was no feeling of gaining, reading and becoming on their faces.
I saw them the form of duty - the symptom of the duties mentioned in the Gita - the symptom of it.
Any society and government have no spell of equity and equal opportunity.
Their thinking is very natural.
They told me about an incident, craftsmen speak from Bangalore.
I read the news that they committed suicide in a cheat mail, a woman froda, slaughtered 11 lakhs.
As a woman, I feel sorry for her family.
I want to know what your opinion is about such a cheetfrod mail.
I realized he left everything in a few minutes.
You may have been wrong sometimes.
They're so simple they're telling the story.
But I had a very funny experience in this neighborhood.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The boys and girls were very enthusiastic.
They came as a big album and joy was shadowed on their face.
Artificial paintings were done at the station.
Not only this, in the rural areas, plastic bottles and oil utensils found in the middle of silk dustbins have been collected and planted with soil and they have built a Vertical Garden.
On one side of the railway station, this Vertical Garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new impression.
My dear countrymen, the time of festivals has come in our country over the years.
Think, don't give a gift to the sister to protect her life and not only will there be women cooking food in our house.
There will be a woman who cleanses our house and she will be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us are born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister born after independence.
May the country immerse in the spirit of the freedom fighters, and once again the humility of freedom.
We all can create this atmosphere.
And the celebration of Independence Day should become a programme of the people of the country without a government programme.
We have to be our own festival like Diwali.
I would like you to do some good things in this regard with inspiration from patriotism in patriotism.
Its pictures will definitely be sent on the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere in the country.
You might want that things in your mind should be presented from the Red Fort with the same sharpness.
As your representative, as your key servant, if I want to speak these things from the Red Fort, I invite you.
I do not want to be the Prime Minister's statement from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the technology platform is easier for you to reach out to me.
I am grateful to Akashwani for presenting Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 pm.
Many of these suggestions are helping the functioning of my government.
Perhaps, there's a news about a week to start the rainy season, so our anxiety is even more.
In most parts of the country, the hot heat of summer is being felt.
Climate change is enhancing such problems.
The widespreadth of the forest area was reduced and the trees were cut.
In a way, human beings destroy nature and destroy themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions on the environment all over the world.
In the last few days, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himalayan valleys have become a volcano and you must have understood this.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to meet the Chief Ministers of 11 states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha.
I listened carefully to every country.
Normally, how much the money the central government has been sanctioned and how much it has been spent, there has been no such subtle discussion in this regard.
The fact that in many areas, water conservation, environment, dry minimisation, livestock conservation, and in some way it has shown excellent work for the entire country was also embarrassing to the officials of the Government of India.
I told the NITI Aayog that by adopting good models, we should take steps to implement it in other states.
Some states, especially Andhra and Gujarat, have been fully utilised.
I would like to take the successful tests of the States to other regions through NITI Aayog.
Public participation is a major foundation for success in such issues.
I believe that if there is a comprehensive plan, if the provisions are completed within the time frame by using appropriate technology, I can make significant changes.
Irrigation is also important.
Their aim is to involve two and three lakh hectares of land more in micro-irrigation every year.
Chhattisgarh has launched the Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan.
In Madhya Pradesh, about 22,000 ponds have been included in the Balram Talab Yojana, which is not a small number.
They were aimed at water conservation and projects for water conservation of 10-20 kms have been implemented in some states by creating small molecules in some states.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that one drop of rains received by June, July, August and September should not lose water.
Now we have to think about how to be a place for water conservation.
God has provided water according to our needs and nature has fulfilled our requirements.
Looking at a lot of water, we'll be careless, and when the rainy season is over, we'll be sorry to get water.
In the past, the media spoke of the problems of water availability.
May the media provide guidance for water conservation and extend its work, I believe that the media will also participate in water conservation solutions.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
We need to create a transparent India.
Our projects should be brought to every corner of India without equivalent implications.
We have to make small changes in our old mindsets.
But today the situation has changed completely.
The world looks like a swimming glimpse of cashless society.
With electronic technology, it is possible to send and capture money from all over the world.
When we gather together, we can move forward as a wealthy group.
You may have seen that RPA CARD has been given with Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, the Credit Debit Card will be used in the form of Credit Debit Card.
There's no need for taking money from the pocket, oil or anything.
This is the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transction - PI which will transform the permanent systems.
Your mobile phone will make Money Transaction money disposal very easy.
Perhaps, if it's possible, RPA CARDs don't always have to walk with them.
Besides, post offices have also been sustained for banking services.
Unlawful transactions will last forever.
The effect of black money will be better.
So, my countrymen, I wish we'll start this.
Once we start, we can move very easily.
Today, 10 years ago, if we think so many mobile phones will be in our hands.
Let's become a non-moneyed society.
It would've been better if it could happen without a football.
My dear countrymen, whenever we come to the Olympics competition or when we start sports, we will be far behind in the gold medal.
If you get silver.
In order to encourage our sportspersons who are participating in the Rio Olympics, each one has to enhance their self-confidence and enthusiasm.
Over the past week, we all were worried about the results of the election, especially in Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons and encouraging our sportspersons such things provide greater spirit and strength to each other.
Without soaking everyone on the fertilizers of the Jayapachayas, India has to put its seal in front of the world with a sportsman spirit.
The results of the students who have worked hard throughout the year in the 10th and 12th classes have been followed one by one.
I want to tell those who are unable to win. I have a lot to do in life.
A Mr. seriously in Madhya Pradesh...
Gaurav Patel presented a big problem to me.
33 per cent of the market was not happy.
Everybody told me that I lost 90 percent of the 4 Marks.
I didn't know what I felt like a burden.
I carefully read your letter.
I think, perhaps, this pain is not yours.
Like you, millions and millions of students are also there because this is a environment that is born.
By finding satisfaction in all matters, we can lead the society to the direction of satisfaction and peace.
Your relatives, colleagues and friends are 89.
I have written to Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur and he is almost the same subject.
He says people from my neighbours don't accept our results.
If I had a little better - I don't remember the whole poem, but I had written a poet a long time ago that I painted my life's canvas.
Some said it would be better if it was yellow instead of blue.
Some said it would have been better if it was there instead of putting this line here.
It would have been better if one or two of my eyes were to see the picture of my pain.
Everybody was talking about the tachup.
Thousands of students like you are like this.
You are capable of fulfilling the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much that you don't lose balance in such a situation.
Everyone expresses the need.
But stand firm in your own hands and try to fill a little more beautifully.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is the foundation of great success.
The unsatisfaction that took place from the victory will not be the step of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You might have heard of Santoor's instrument.
There was a time when Santoor was associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But there was a Pandit Shiva Kumar who made it the greatest instrument in the world.
Shehnai - our music was in limited places all over the world.
Most of the kings were at the doors of the kings.
But when Ustad Bismilakhan was handled in Shehna, it became a worldwide instrument.
It is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but if the disease comes, the cost of reviving health is very high.
If anyone can help the poor, it is only for cleanliness.
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
There has been a special opinion with Yoga all over the world, with respect and faith in it.
Yoga provides the power to lead a balanced life to a stressed world.
Every person has to spend 20-25 minutes in his lifestyle or 30 minutes for Yoga.
For this, the 21st June Yoga Day inspires us.
Sometimes a social outlook leads to changes in the life of a person.
I hope you're gonna take the initiative anywhere on June 21.
In your neighbouring areas, in your city, in villages, in your school and institutions, replace it even in the office.
Start a month from now, and look, you'll be participating on 21st June.
I'm going to attend the programme in Chandigarh this year.
My dear countrymen, I have been constantly associated with you through this programme called Mann Ki Baat.
A long time ago, I gave you a mobile number, and you could call Missed Col and hear Mann Ki Baat.
But it has made it even more simple.
Now you have only four times to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call Missed in this number 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, I once again greet you all.
Don't forget about the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, 2019 July
Mann Ki Baat is the time I and you are waiting for.
This time too many letters, commands, phone calls, many stories, suggestions and inspirations...
People have been discussing books on various subjects such as science, technology, innovations, history, culture, business, life history etc.
People urged me to discuss other books.
But I don't have to tell you that I can't take time to read a lot of books.
Let us start a permanent book corner in the Narendra Modi App and write it and discuss it when we read a new book.
You can suggest a name for this book corner.
I wish this book corner becomes an active platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have worked hard on water conservation.
People share information about traditional methods.
For example, the zeal of the villagers towards water conservation in the village of Ara Kere in Ormanji Block, a little away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example for everyone.
The charming state of Northeast India, Meghalaya, has become a waterwater state.
I appreciate the government there.
A very small water is required in Haryana, but emphasis is being given to the farming that does not lose the farmers.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for discussing with the farmers, removing them from traditional farming and inspiring them to cultivate some water requirements.
It's time for festivals.
Festivals are also held during festivals.
These fairs should also be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given in a very good way, the exhibitions, the streets, the message of water conservation along with the festival can be very unpleasant.
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
Especially the achievements of children and their work are giving us new energy.
So I want to talk about some children.
They were Nidhi Baipe, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preity Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Arnyathesh Ganguli, Hritik Alamada.
When I talk about them, you will fill your mind with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know the word Cancer is one of the most scared in the world.
After winning the sports, he won the medal and won the champion.
But it was a rare occasion that they were champions before participating in the competition.
That's also the champions in the fight for life.
World Children's Winners Games took place in Moscow this month.
That is, those who have won a fight against cancer in their lives and have been participating in the competition like shooting, chess, swimming, race and football.
All these champions in our country won the medal in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of India's success in space beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjay Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana and P.
2019 is a good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, the country was proud to travel from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota to the atmosphere.
The launch pictures of Chandrayaan 2 have filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and happiness.
Chandrayaan 2 mission is special in various ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan 2 is completely Indian.
But we must always remember that it will be capable of surviving.
I am very hopeful that Chandrayaan 2 will inspire the youth of the country to turn towards the world of science and innovation.
Science is extremely opening the path of development.
We are waiting for September to land Lander Vikram and Rover Prayag on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share with the students of the country, friends of the youth about a very attractive competition.
The youngsters of the country want to invite the youth to a quiz competition and the quests related to space, Indias science mission and scientific technologies will be the key topic of problems.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this issue and make it attractive and pleasant and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially urge schools, guardians, enthusiastic principals and teachers to try their school to succeed.
Encourage all schools to participate in this.
This will be a historical event in their lives for the victorious students.
But it has to be participated in the issue, get the highest mark and win.
Inspire more friends.
My dear friends, you must have noticed one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhata Abhiyan has increased momentum from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of Over Bridges and Schools to the wells, it became a big step with them.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a major role in this regard.
We need to develop a culture that produces wealth from waste in our society.
In a way, we have to move from the waste to the sowing of gold.
My dear countrymen, last day, I read a very attractive text in MyGov.
This command was his brother Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: It is very happy to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I participated actively in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobilisation programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this kind of programmes are going to be over three months.
Also, the programme should be monitored online.
This programme shows how incompatible the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development and how enthusiastic they are.
For the first time, the big officers of the country came directly to the villages and the officers who had not seen the villagers came to their homes to understand the obstacles in the development and to solve the problems, and the programme took place for a week.
How to increase the income of the people
He said that the service of the officers has been an impact on the lives of ordinary people and the rural people have opened their minds and expressed their problems.
Discussions were held on issues such as literacy, women-male ratio, health, waste-free, water conservation, electricity, water, girls' education and issues of elderly citizens.
Friends, This programme was not a function of the government that the officer had travelled around the village throughout the day, but this time the officers had spent two days and one night in the Panchayat, so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added several things to make this programme more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, Sports Competition for Children was organized.
Sports kits, job cards of National Employment Assurance Scheme, Pattika Jati and Scheduled Certificates were distributed there.
This kind of programmes and people's participation in them seeks the power of our brothers and sisters in Kashmir, the power of progress is above the strength of the bombs and guns.
It is obvious that those who want to disperse the path of development, who want to create obstacles, they cannot achieve their efficient goals.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, the Gyanpeeth Awardee, said in his poem this way about the glory of the month of Shravana.
In this, he said, Hodige Madige Agyedu Adarga land is Magna that the relationship between the rainy season and the water streams is different, the land is engraved in its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages across India celebrate the Shravana month in their own ways.
In this season, when we look at the environment, it seems as if the earth is covered with greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, some people are fasting regularly, and they are waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this time, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
This time more than 4 years of devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra while talking about Shravan.
From 1st July till now, more than three lakh pilgrims visited the pious Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days in 2015, more than those who participated in this journey, participated in just 28 days this time.
I especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who returned from the journey are changing the zeal and spirit of the people of the state.
All these are very helpful in future pilgrimages.
On the other hand, it is time for heavy rains in many parts of the country.
Dear people, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Many times it seems that India is a country that gains economic wealth through festivals.
Festivals become an opportunity for economic frustration for the poor of the society.
You know I use technology well and I get a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Sawalesh Warker wrote to me that this season is the tourist season.
A large number of national and foreign tourists are visiting.
People also celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes they listen to disappointing things from different corners of the country.
In the midst of that, millions of people do some good in their own way, like the latter, this is the strength of the country.
Regular opportunities are being created for education and employment.
When the world was attracted by Yoga and celebrated International Yoga Day, we believed and proud of India's strength.
This feeling reflects the vastness of India.
Today, the word Swachhta is drowned in houses.
The peoples participation in it is increasing.
That's a service route.
I have also made small efforts on my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youngsters, on 15th August, the first discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India has started in the Red Fort.
Thereafter, it was discussed in government departments.
Can India become a start-up capital
We can start new start-ups and new innovations, whether in the manufacturing sector or in the service sector or in the agriculture hygiene to create a big opportunity for the youth among the States.
If you think so, it's wrong.
Youngsters from every corner of India should be given an opportunity to talent.
Start-up India and Stand-up India cannot shrink only in a few cities.
It should be spread to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to expand this.
I'll discuss with you clearly on January 16.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youngsters, the 12th January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Millions of people like me are inspired by Swami Vivekananda.
Since 12th January, 1995, Swami Vivekananda is being celebrated as the National Youth Festival.
This year, from 12th to 16th January, it is celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
A small India is going to be created there - a young India.
In a way, you can see the smell of dreams.
We can see the power of decisions.
Can you share your suggestions about this Youth Festival
I believe that this is the result of your initiative.
Thank you a thousand.
Are you a person working in this field
That's why you can understand this, you have to face a lot of difficulties
Sometimes disabled, sometimes disabled, sometimes disabled, sometimes so many words.
It's really important in every word.
This year, the Government of India started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
We started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
It will facilitate all kinds of infrastructure development and facilitate them.
Be it schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, ramps in railway stations, parking, lifts, braille lipis, all these innovations need to be easier for them.
Technology is required and system requires sensitivity.
The effort has started and people's participation is getting.
People like it.
The files shouldn't be ruined before that.
In fact, all the schemes are for the common man and the Dalits.
In the past, the Government of India has conducted an inquiry into how to benefit the right owners of the schemes.
In our country, subsidy is given to gas cylinders.
It wasn't even checked whether the data was maintained properly.
Therefore, the government has made some changes in this.
Integration of Aadhar Card, a Mission to deliver subsidy to the bank account of the beneficiary directly through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jan Dhan Account.
I am privileged to note that it has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest Director of the World, Benefit Transfer Scheme.
On the one hand, opening of Aadhaar Card Campaign on the other hand, and creating a list of beneficiaries and connecting them with a bank account on the other hand, by coordinating with the Central Governments.
At many places, the money is now directly deposited in the account of the workers.
There were complaints about the scholarship of the students and efforts have been made to resolve it.
Approximately 40 crore rupees have been directly reached to the beneficiaries' accounts through various schemes.
Approximately 30 to 40 projects have been included in Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
In the Parliament, two days were shifted to a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are mostly conscious of our duties in the election time, and we are convinced by advertisements and wall writings that it is our duty to vote.
Why don't we read about duties in everyday life as in the election time
Whether the country sees the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar for a minute on 26th January organised discussions on the basis of duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organizations
If 125 crore people follow each other and fulfill their duties, then it will be an unforgettable history.
We'll start discussing it.
You'll get the opportunity to go somewhere.
Festivals have its own importance in social life.
Continuous news of natural calamities is regular from every corner of the world.
We have never thought or imagined these accidents.
We are now getting an experience that the impact of climate change is increasing at a rapid pace.
The central government is working with them shoulder to shoulder.
But the environment has to think about the need for changes when there is such a problem.
That's a good start.
Today, I received a message from Jalandhar in Punjab from Lakhwinder Singh, "I am speaking from Lakhwinder Singh, Jalandhar district of Punjab.
"I am very happy to hear your question, Lakhwinder Singh.
The main reason for my joy is that you're doing biological cultivation.
Not only this, along with organic farming, you are well aware of the problems of farmers.
But it is not right to think that this happens only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the nature of all Indians and we are following the traditional way of burning the ruins of crops.
First, we weren't aware of such a loss.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Second, I didn't even train how to do this.
But your concern is right.
But these aren't real.
The ruins of crops are also expensive.
Secondly, the surface of the earth gets soaked by the fire.
We can't live even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, if the ruins of the crop are burnt, the ruins are burnt to the mother's peel.
Animals can also be used for food and it saves our land.
Not only that, put the fertilizer from the same land there, it gives double profit.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer friends who sing their lives.
They shared their experience.
They had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and ten thousand hectares per hectares to remove the ruins of banana after harvesting them.
The ruins of the banana remain the same until people who don't change them bring the tractor.
However, some farmers have digged these ruins of banana from 6-8 inches to the ground.
Last time I talked about organ donations in Mann Ki Bati.
He also spoke of the helpline of 'Chachcha' for organ donation.
Filmmaker Raveena Tandon and other renowned persons participated in the event.
You can save many lives worth donating organs.
In a way organ donation provides immortality .
When the organ changes from one body to another then that organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What's greater donor than that
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation was launched on 27th November for patients waiting for organ transplantation.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every mandate and in the right sense the best support for the needy.
Everybody has to move forward for this.
As I mentioned earlier, December 3 is being celebrated as International Disability Day.
Physically and mentally disabled are the owners of unparalleled will and courage.
They feel sorry when they're laughing.
We start crying when there's a little difficulty.
When we think of how they live, we feel simple pain.
How do they live
It is commendable that their determination, their ways of resistance to life and their passion to empower the troubles.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmad.
He's 40, 42 years old.
In 1996, the terrorists shot him in Kashmir.
Though he was a victim of the gun of terrorists, he was wonderfully saved.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed and one part of his intestine was lost.
The spinal cord was severely damaged.
He lost his ability to stay in his own legs forever, but he did not agree.
The wound of extremism didn't defeat him.
How to improve the relevant equipment for physically handicapped persons, how to set up systems in public and government offices.
Is Javed's life sufficient to inspire every corner of India
I especially remember the life of Javed Ahmad, his penance and his dedication on December 3.
I am talking about Javed because of lack of time, but in every corner of India, such inspirational lamps are burning.
Our country is too big.
There's a lot of things that depend on the government.
More than one experience changes our vision of government systems throughout the lifetime.
They are carrying out many social activities in India.
Millions of people may have worked in this way in our surroundings.
What's the pleasure of seeing the patient with friends
Are they themselves participating in the sorrows of the society
I congratulate all the aspirational workers of India who are working in this way in the name of 'Jamunamani'.
Besides ensuring more discussions on e books, one of the youngsters should tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what happens here and what happens there.
Not only this, you are actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome all of you to nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the world is worried about climate change.
The friend who led me to share this uncomfortable experience had sent me an ink to know and see it.
However, if they have done one thing, there will be no such thing as some other educated people have thought.
They are working to bring light to the poor in their region through solar energy.
They fought against darkness and ruined their name.
They built a plant of solar lighting chain through a womens collaboration.
They are giving rantals to the local monks at a rent of only 100 rupees per month.
We know what the world's largest people do about climate change.
Thank you very much for Ee News.
But the beginning is very good.
42,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore) has been provided to 66 lakh people in a very short span of time.
Whether it is employed in slaughter, journal distributors, milkkeepers and those employed will get the real benefit.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
The other is from Mumbai to Shailesh Bhosla.
8. 5 lakh (8.
During our Swachh Bharat programme, I used to say that it is a new entrepreneurship through that scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in reaching the path of action.
But many don't know much about this project.
How should the programme be structured
How can Logo be
But I hope there are many more suggestions.
Many basic projects are required.
It will also provide an honour to the active participants.
Moreover, many other awards have also been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has started.
Encouraging a good environment in the family and making it a festival.
You will be able to know how much the outskirts of Chaitanya are made through the exercise festival.
The whole day will be more energetic.
If there's a good weather, there's a good habit.
My dear brother, I once again congratulate you.
Jai Hind.
I was fortunate to present Mann Ki Baat for the first time on October 3 last year.
One year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can tell you that this thought of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I realized it.
Several issues have started from the bottom to the government.
And, it is really the basic principle of governance that information should come down from the top to the top of the direction.
Did anyone ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
But it happened.
So, Mann Ki Baat has created an opportunity to showcase the strength of the community.
The whole world was surprised to say that I was selfie with Daughter one day.
It was a silent revolution.
People from every corner and corner of India have sent lakhs of pictures.
We have such a heritage, perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government will not be thinking about it.
Mann Ki Baat became a platform for the government and people took up their work without a single rupee.
I am happy to note about Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme in October last year.
When I mentioned Gandhi Jayanti, I urged the people to celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary on 2nd October with a boost to the entire nation and celebrate Khadi products.
There was a time called Khadi for the nation.
According to the change of time, can't it be called Khadi for fashion now
I wanted to buy Khadi to the people, I wanted to do something.
I am happy to say that Khadi sales have almost doubled.
This wasn't done by government advertisements.
This is not the achievement that has spent lakhs and crores of rupees.
It's a feeling of people's power and a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Bath, the poor smokes in the house of the poor, the children cry.
Do they want to get LPG cylinders
Today, I can say with great pleasure that 30 lakh families of our country have left the LPG subsidy.
I saw a Retired School Teacher in the channel standing in the ueen to facilitate a widowed woman subsidy.
It is difficult for the middle class and the lower class to leave the subsidy.
But such people have left the subsidy.
Isn't this a silent revolution
We can't see people's power in this.
The governments must include the lessons that our governments have a large public power-skilled, energetic and determined society outside this framework.
What else do you want to be happy about this
I thought about a new experiment this time in Mann Ki Baat.
There will be no place in India where people don't make phone calls.
This is a pleasant experience.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself, and I liked it.
My team is taking action about the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing wondered and enjoyed me.
Maybe we're negative.
But I've lost my experience.
These fifty thousand people said their own way.
How much is the creative thinking of the common man of the country, how big it is for the country
Perhaps, there are only one or two phone calls from the backdrop of serious complaints.
More than 90 per cent of the energy supply was a pleasant thing.
They must have heard the radio.
Pawan Acharya sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi is that please urge the people of India to use the maximum number of lamps for Diwali through the Mann Ki Baat programme this year.
It will benefit the environment and provide employment opportunities to thousands of soil utensils brothers.
I believe that this feeling like Pavan Acharya will reach and spread across the corner and corners of India.
I tell the countrymen that if we are implementing the things that Pawan Acharya has said in the upcoming festivals then the lamp will appear in their homes but the light will be spreading in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi
With our armies guarding the sea-car-air.
The war with Pakistan in 1965 completed 50 years.
A 'Sauryaanjali' exhibition was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to make history, it is important to know and understand the microscopes of history.
History connects us with our roots.
If there is a loss of relations with history, the possibility of historical construction can also be completely circulated.
Don't show up like me.
I returned in two and a half hours.
The kid's right.
And I've heard about what happened.
I don't think it was a bad thing that even in the best parliament that I have seen it, discussions about the cleanliness of India are going on.
On the other hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, a child of this country speaks about cleanliness and what is the biggest fortune for one country
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred and awakening about cleanliness.
It will force governments to work.
When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we have to take this task for the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi said
If there is an opportunity to choose cleanliness and freedom, then I will first choose cleanliness and then freedom.
Gandhiji gave the importance of cleanliness more than freedom.
Gulshan Arora MyGov from Delhi.
I would like to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayalji.
My dear brothers and sisters, the life of great men always inspires us.
Our work, the great men don't imagine what thoughts were followers of.
Every person who lives and dies for the country is inspired by us.
These days there are opportunities to remember many great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Lal Bahadur Scientist Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October, I am very little mentioned.
I'm putting a special mission on 2nd October.
Whether it uses it or gives equal importance to handicrafts along with Khadi.
Brothers and sisters are doing a lot of work.
Khadi manufacturing poor widow will reach home.
Therefore, this Diwali will definitely be slaughtered in the houses and body of each of you.
Look, the sales have almost doubled last time.
My dear countrymen, I am glad about one thing.
I share it with you.
When I went to Calcutta in May, the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose came to see me.
Everything was arranged by him.
I got the opportunity to spend a long time with the family members of Subhas Chandra Bose.
My name is Bhargavi Kaike.
I am told that you have to make the younger generation aware about Voters Registration, so in the coming days the participation of the younger generation will increase and in the future, the participation of the younger generation will increase in government elections and governance.
Thank you, Shri Bhagwari said that the name of the voter list is incorporated and the matter of voting.
I would like to especially congratulate the Election Commission of India for this.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission was only a regulator, but it has changed significantly over the last few years.
This is a very good change, but the Election Commission doesn't work.
In general, I would like to say that the election was the first day to vote and water.
One, a seven-year-old student is studying in 7th class at Kendra Vidyalaya at Kshitij Pandey and Banaras Hindu University.
I would like to increase scientific importance and interest in our children.
9 years of age.
When he asked her father, she said it's been telling you since 5 years of age.
I asked where did I learn
So I thought I should share with you.
We do a lot of things you see on TV and don't know through newspapers.
What's the problem to do once a month
Friends from Akashwani have to wait for me for half an hour.
It's the best of a month's telecast.
Beginning from Germany, the people of Hindustan were encouraging the freedom struggle through radio.
The launch of Azad Hind Radio was through the retaliation news bullet.
He had broadcast all languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed a year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
We'll meet Mann Ki Bath next month.
Let your suggestions continue.
The government benefits from your suggestions.
It starts to make a good change.
Your partnership is precious, precious.
My best wishes once more.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the people of India on 30th August 2015 at 11 a.m.
You have my greetings, I've got an opportunity to present your minds in front of you.
On this occasion, the people of South India celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan across our country.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security for the common man.
In a short span of time, all the dignitaries have adopted these schemes.
At the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan, I urged our sisters to implement security schemes.
I see this as a good sign.
Greetings to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
Today, a year ago, I had provided Jan Dhan scheme to a large number of people before talking to you.
The banking sector is the main source of the economy and has created a bank friendly scheme to bring these ERPAs to the poor.
Today, more than lakhs of bank friends are working across the country for a step.
This has helped youngsters get jobs.
You will definitely be happy to hear that in a year, there have been one lakh three and a half thousand economic awareness camps for connecting the banking sector economic system and the poor.
I've done this thing in front of you... to continue this relationship is your job.
All our accounts should be effective.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices and their conversations, i.e. the generosity and harmony that is seen in the Sufi tradition, have the palms of music.
I am happy that they invited me to Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
I will have the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya along with these scholars from all over the world.
It'll be a pleasant moment for me, my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I want to tell my mind again.
It has already been mentioned about these issues.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard me in the public meetings.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you don't have anything to be afraid.
I don't give any such opportunity.
We had an Ordinance.
The term of the Ordinance is over tomorrow on 31st August.
I've decided to finish the term.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, I want to tell you that this is not just a seal but a mantra of ours.
I have to tell you another thing.
Two days ago, the war in 1965 completed 50 years.
Whenever he remembered the war in 1965, the remembrance of Lal Bahadur Shastri was regular.
At the same time, he will also be remembered as Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is natural to remember all the martyrs who have laid down the Tricolor Flag of India and their valour and valour.
I salute all those associated with the 65th war victory.
He also bows to the heroes.
Such moments of history are inspiring us.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of the Sufi tradition, I got the opportunity to interact with the eminent scientists of the country for hours and listen to them.
I am very happy that India is showcasing excellent work in various fields of science.
Our scientists are actually doing great things.
How to bring such research to the common man
How to use these principles at a practical level
I said in the last Mann Ki Baat that we should lead our students to science.
After this discussion, I felt there were many opportunities and chances.
I would like to tell my dear young friends something special.
In recent times, there have been several guests from all over the world to India.
Why don't we connect our festivals with cleanliness
The beginning of the rain was good this year.
In our country, there is a reduction in food grains, oilseeds and pulses.
The poor need food grains and oil for cooking vegetables.
However, this year's crops are very happy, nearly 50 increase in food grains this year and 33 increase in oilseeds.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this reason.
My dear countrymen, July 26 has been recorded in the history of our country as Kargil Vijay Diwas.
The more the farmers of the country are connected with the land, the more the military and the country are connected.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has killed hundred enemy soldiers.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India is able to speak in front of the world today.
This is the reason why I convey my best wishes to our brave soldiers on Kargil Vijay Diwas.
Smt. Suchitra Raghwachary in Chennai has sent several suggestions.
I believe you all send good suggestions.
I want to make my vision clear about one thing.
I don't want to give any advice to anyone, but don't find ways to remove the state governments, central governments, local autonomous institutions from their responsibilities.
Two days ago, I had noticed the scene of a vehicle accident in Delhi, and after 10 minutes of the accident, the scooter was on the way.
He didn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me on topics and make the common man aware about road safety issues.
May the Hoskot resident of Bangalore be Akshay, the Prasanka Kunje in Mudubidri in Karnataka - people are very much, I don't remember the names of all of them - they have expressed their grief.
Every accident in our country is happening every day in a minute.
One death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most sad thing is that about one-third of those who die are youth between 15 and 25, each of these deaths hold a whole family.
Another thing I remember is that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' means a good brother will give his sister a toilet on Raksha Bandhan's day.
Inspire all such brothers and sisters to make toilets for their sisters and mothers and sisters in the entire district do not have to defecate in the open space.
In Chhattisgarh, Rajnandgaon is a small village where workers live.
The people of that village have started and completed the campaign to build toilets for the past few months.
Now in that village no one has to urinate in the open space.
I write Bhavesh Dheka from Guwahati about the problems of the North-Eastern States.
It was decided to organize a seven-day camp in the states of Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and a group of Central Government officials will go to the North-Eastern states.
The results of this effort will be there in the coming days.
It is very anxious to have no sense of science.
In a way, science and technology are the heights of development.
Our IAS officers have learnt a lot of things in a big way, they must often communicate with children in schools or colleges around two or four hours a week and their experiences are their strength.
We have started it and in the coming years, our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children of the village do not have difficulty when they are studying during the examination days.
If you want to start small and big industries in the villages then you also need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge mobile, they have to go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should also be available to the villages.
That is why the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti programme was started.
In today's Mann Ki Bati, I have expressed my heart to talk about every Indian.
Likewise, August and September are our days of celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
In the midst of the needy, in a calm atmosphere, many things of 130 crore people have been told to the family as they were talking about.
Sometimes it becomes a motivation for those who want their own things.
I just used my words, but I didn't think I didn't have this program, it's you.
I felt a humility.
Anyway, the last chance has come.
Mann Ki Baat in a family circle, small and small kids.
Let us continue this programme, in a way, by giving birth to a new oxygen that causes changes in society and life.
A lot of messages came in the last months, and people said that it's sorry that there's no Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes I think it's my journey from 'Swa' to 'Samshti'.
This is my journey to Nami.
My interaction with you for me was in a way a part of my spiritual journey.
Many people asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the election.
I had an opportunity to face with me for me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes because of the inspiration of my thought process, sometimes the others are encouraging.
When people face the challenges faced by the country and society, they also suggest solutions.
In letters, people describe the problems, peace and suggestions, express a concept, direct or indirect.
That is, in one way, I feel in your words a sign of how to get peace and peace for the society.
Mann Ki Baat is a mirror for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of spiritual strength, strength and access to the people.
We need to unite that strength and that achievement, give them an opportunity, they need to be implemented.
Mann Ki Baat says that 130 crore people are keen and actively united in the progress of the country.
You can imagine how happy my mind will be when I analyze these things and how much energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we'll continue Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country, the election was not for health, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in a country in the world, the people there voted for democracy, not only for democracy, but for the rest of their rights, powers and requirements.
The country saw such an election in 1977.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and we can see that this number is normal.
But if this is the world's population, it will be seen that more than one country other than China has voted in India.
The number of people who voted in 2019 is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of Europe.
This reflects the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the largest democratic election in the world history.
You can imagine how much resources and human power are required to conduct such elections.
This election has been conducted by lakhs of teachers, officers and other officials, Rapakal.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces have been responsible for successfully conducting this Mahayana of Democracy and 20 lakh police personnel from different States worked hard and worked hard.
As a result of all their hard work, more people have been able to vote this time than before.
Nearly 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines all over the country have come to polls.
You can imagine how big it is.
A voter can't use his vote, and that's what he did.
In a far-flung area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female electorate has prepared a polling station.
You will be surprised to hear that the electorate had to travel for two days to reach there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
The highest polling station in the world is also in India.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahole-Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
In this election, the percentage of votes of women and men was almost equal.
This is another fact that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament who have lost their history.
I appreciate the Election Commission and all those associated with the Returning Programme and bow down to the vigilant voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you've often heard me saying, "Bokey not book."
I said to welcome the people, 'Tuke books instead of flowers'.
Since then, people have started giving books somewhere.
His stories include all the psychological disorders of India.
When he was reading the story of 'Nasha' (Lahari), my mind turned to the economic imbalance that spread in society.
I remembered the days I was a young man.
How the discussions were held overnight on this subject came to mind.
Jamindar's son, Ishwari and Bir of the poor family, can't understand when you don't have to learn from this story.
A sensitive child's love for his grandfather is a sensitive feeling at his young age.
We really see human sensitivity when we buy from Hamid Festival of 4-5 years of age from the ropeway and reach the grandfather's side.
After losing the crop, the farmer Haldu is happy that he will not have to sleep in the field in a very cold winter.
Even though these stories are about centuries ago, we still feel the same.
K.
Muralidhara and P.
Today, this library is a guide for all, including tribal children.
In Gujarat, the mass movement called Wanche Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Millions of people from all ages have participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, I have to request you for some time and give you some time to books in your daily affairs.
You will have a good experience, you must write about the book 'Narendramodi App' and let all the listeners of 'Man Ki Bati' know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about the challenges being faced not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your opinions in Narendra Modi App and My Geovi... many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai in Balgavi, Sithamshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, many others like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf have written to me the challenges related to water.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless us as maternal blessings, grace on us.
Water deficiency affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water available in rainy season is available throughout the year.
8 per cent.
It's time to find solutions to this problem.
With the participation of the people like other issues, with the strength of the people, we will find solutions to this problem with the ability, collaboration and determination of one crore 30 million people.
With the importance of water, the new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country.
This will enable all water related issues to be resolved.
A few days ago I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers across the country.
I wrote that the meeting of the people of the village called for water conservation, water conservation, not losing every rain, and think with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done it and on 22nd of this month thousands of panchayats have donated labour.
The people of the villages resolved to collect every water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to what message was given to all of us by the village chief of Lupung Panchayat in Katakmandi block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand: "My name is Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we did not believe that the Prime Minister had written such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the villagers and all the villagers in the name of their enthusiasm.
The people of the village are now competing to build a temple for water in their villages.
As I said, social efforts can make positive changes.
None of the country can adopt 'a single source' to deal with the water problem.
Therefore, efforts are being made in different ways in different parts.
But everyone's goal is the same - water conservation, water conservation.
Trainage lines are being repaired in Punjab.
This effort will help in preventing floods.
The lives of the rural people have changed through the construction of tanks in Timaipalli, Telangana.
Small ponds built in the farmland in Kabirdham, Rajasthan have been made a big change.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where twenty thousand women organized to revive the Naga river.
In collaboration with each other, they also read about the women of Gwali, who have worked well for rain water conservation.
I am confident that if we work together and make a strong effort, we can make it possible.
When people gather together, water will be preserved.
I say that water is touching, and that touching water will create a new life.
One water conservation campaign will be organised to protect every drop of water.
It will also discuss water related issues and promote water conservation methods.
I urge the distinguished personalities of various sectors to undertake separate campaigns for water conservation.
All those in the film sector, in the field of sports, in the media, friends, social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, stories and singing songs, must lead this gathering in their own way.
We can awaken the society, unite the society, join the society.
Look, we can see changes in our eyes.
I urge you all to share knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If you have the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of a revered father, then you must see another house behind the father's house where there is a 200-year-old reservoir, which still has water.
There are arrangements to stop rain water.
I always say all those who go to the Kirti temple must see that reservoir.
There will be a variety of water reservoirs.
Exchange your knowledge of sharing you all through JanShakti4alShaktiHashTag.
My dear countrymen, I want to express my gratitude to you in one thing and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, if all those who love Yoga welcome the sun as soon as the sun rises in every corner of the world, it is a journey till the sun sets.
The national leaders, Prime Ministers, well-known people and ordinary people from all over the world showed how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
The world looked like a very happy family.
We all know that for the creation of a healthy society, we need healthy and sensitive persons, Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is an important matter related to social service.
Isn't such a service to be accepted and respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Minister's Award for those who have played an important role in promoting and propagating Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how important they have played in the promotion of Yoga about the great organisations around the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan is conducting several institutes and training courses.
Miss Italy.
We have inspiring examples.
Is this a matter of Yoga that Indians can stand behind
Behar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger was also honoured and has been dedicated to Yoga for the last decade.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni also honoured and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your suggestions.
Meeting with your thoughts is a great journey for me, and Mann Ki Baat is only forever.
Come on, let's be together, let's share ideas.
I'm listening to you, I'll take care of it, I'll understand it.
Sometimes I'll try to live with your emotions.
You must have blessed.
You are my motivation, you are my energy.
Come, let's share the happiness of Mann Ki Bati together and fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
(Manas say- 53rd Lakum) Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for the 125 crore Indians.
To sleep peacefully, our brave sons kept watching the night.
At the same time, the attackers responded in their own language.
You must have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out the terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the spirit of their families was seen through mediums, which enhances the entire country's enthusiasm.
The feelings expressed by the father of Dhir Jawan Ratna Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar are inspiring for all of us.
The nation salutes the unprecedented courage of the martyr Prasanna Sahu's wife Meenaji at Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He promised to add one of his own sons to the CRPF.
This feeling is seen in every house of our brave and brave martyrs.
I have to tell the youngsters that the feelings of these families, their minds, their minds and their minds should be understood.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
Dear people, the war memorial is being witnessed in this long time since independence.
It is natural to have curiosity and enthusiasm among the people in this regard.
Onkar Shetty National War Memorial from Karnataka is happy to be completed on the Narendra Modi App.
I felt surprising and painful that there was no longer a national war memorial in India.
A war memorial was required to shape the bravery of the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have such a memorial.
I am happy that I have decided to build a National War Memorial and complete it in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our forces.
The country will make a small effort to borrow.
This new memorial has been built near the heart of Delhi i.e. India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am confident that the visit of our people to this National Military Memorial will be equal to a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation for the great martyrs of the soldiers after independence.
The design of the memorial reflects the great courage of our immortal soldiers.
The National Military Memorial is designed in three circles, which depicts the journey from birth to martyrdom of every soldier.
The flame of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the martyrdom of the soldiers.
The second cycle shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circle shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
Among these, the names of the most important martyrs for the country are recorded in golden letters.
After that, the rescue cycle is showcasing security.
In this circle there are rows of dense trees.
I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation in October last year.
It was also a reflection of the idea that the country should be grateful to the men and women police who worked uninterruptedly for our security.
I am sure you will be visiting the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures taken from there in the social media, it is inspired for others, it is a sacred place and they are eager to see these memorials.
My dear countrymen, I have received thousands of letters and suggestions for Mann Ki Baat through several media.
The birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata is naturally on 3rd March.
The two personalities are from different family backgrounds, which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
To pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat, in a way it bows to the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two Mahamakas have enhanced the fame of the entire country not only in Jharkhand.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire country.
Do you know why the English people embarked on such a terrible way
Because even the English people who had built such a big empire were afraid of him.
Birsa Maa used his traditional Ambu and Will to capture the British rule using guns and cannons.
Birsa was not only fighting the British for national freedom but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his short lifetime.
In the dark life of the deprived and the deprived, he brightened the sun.
He sacrificed himself at the age of 25.
The brave sons of Bharatamba, like Birsa Munda, have become everywhere in the country.
There will be no corner of India, which has not played its role in this freedom struggle for centuries.
If the personalities like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence, then the personalities like Jamshedji Tata gave us the gift of big institutions to the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and it should be an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, called the Indian Institute of Science, was a result of his long vision.
Not only this, he established global level institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Meeting between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda on the ship during his visit to America.
It is said that this discussion has been decided to set up the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Morarjibai Deshai, was on 29 February.
As you all know, this day reaches once in four years.
Morarjibai was one of the eldest leaders in the country, the owner of a calm and calm personality.
Morarjibhai was fortunate to present the budget for the first time in the Parliament of independent India.
In the name of this, he had to pay the price of old age.
The then government arrested him and locked him in jail.
But when he won the Janta Party election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The 44th Amendment envisages the procedures of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies to be published in the papers.
The amendment provides for reconstitution of certain powers of the Supreme Court that the fundamental rights obtained through Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be abolished even during the period of time.
It also provides that the President should declare a casualties and the duration of the casualties cannot be extended for more than six months once written by the Cabinet.
In 1975, Morarjibhai announced that the killing of democracy would not repeat in the future.
He will be reminded of his great contribution to maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay homage to the great leader.
My dear countrymen, this time, like every year, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the Padma Awards.
They bring positive changes in the lives of others in different ways through their own hard work.
It was a big thing to bring a rare painting to the new generation.
I gave a gift to former US President Barack Museum, the artistic composition of Tree of Life, built by Abdul Gafur.
Among the Padma Awardees, Shabir Said is known as the servant of Gomata in Marathwada.
You will be surprised to hear about Tao Porchon-ynch in the United States, and Lynch is now a big institution for Yoga.
Dear people, 12 of those who have been awarded the Padma Awards this year are farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector have reached the list of Padma Shri directly.
It is a living picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I'm going to tell you a heart-breaking thing that I have understood for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have got the benefit of this scheme.
I have seen how big change this is bringing about in the lives of the poor.
If you know anyone who is unwilling to treat because of lack of money, tell them about this scheme.
This scheme is only for the poor and dear people, the time of examination is going to start in schools.
In the next few weeks across the country, examinations of various education boards, classes and classes will be started.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to write the examination.
A few days ago, there was a massive programme of Exam Pay Church at Town Hall in Delhi.
In this town hall, I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers from across the country and abroad with the help of technology.
Through radio, I'm talking to millions of families in a way every month.
I think you're part of my family when you're talking to you, reading your letters and listening to what you send through the phone.
It gives me a very pleasant feeling.
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy.
I'll tell you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat 2019 January
On 21st of this month, a very sad country received a message.
Dr. Shri Shri Shri Shivkumar Swamiji was disabled at Siddha Ganga Math in Tumkur district of Karnataka.
Shiva Kumaraswamy dedicated his life to social service.
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us - Kayakve Kailash i. e.
Shivkumar Swamiji was a follower of this philosophy.
During his 111 years of life, he worked for the social, educational and economic growth of thousands of people.
He was reputed as a scholar in English, culture and Kannada.
He was a social reformer.
He tried his entire life to provide food, home, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
He was the priority of all kinds of good for the farmers.
Siddhganga Math was regularly organising Animal Husbandry Festivals.
I have been fortunate to get the blessings of the supremely respected Swamiji.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem about the venerable Swamiji on this occasion.
Once again I pay homage to the Mahatma.
Dear people, on 26th January, 1950, the Constitution was formed in our country.
Our country in that day, for the Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day in a big way.
But I want to tell you something else.
25th January was the foundation day of the Election Commission and this day is celebrated as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the huge election process in India.
It is natural for all our citizens to be proud of the Election Commission to see that our Election Commission is doing it beautifully.
You must have heard that in the Gir forest of Gujarat, there is only a polling booth for a voter.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I compliment the Election Commission for steadily striving to strengthen our democracy.
He congratulates the Election Commission and the Security Officers of all States and other officials for ensuring that they are participants in the electoral process, ensuring free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to responsibilities of the country.
They are going to determine the country's classroom.
It's time to connect your dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if you are aged to vote.
At the same time, we have to think that voting is our own duty.
If you don't vote for any reason in life, then it must be a painful one.
I am sad to see something wrong happening in the country.
Our country is a great Vasundhara.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was one of those great men.
On 23rd January, the entire country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who played their role in the freedom of India.
From the time of independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings were being closed till date.
The locked rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum has a fragrance of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum reflects the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle and inspires us to go to history.
At this very place, the British Government had filed a case against the brave sons of Bharatamba - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Dhilan and Major General Shanwas Khan.
I left the hat in the museum and I wish the visitors to see the hat, and inspire the patriotic motivation.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must continue to bring to the new generation again and again in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I raised the Tricolor Flag 75 years ago, as part of a programme, by lifting the tricolor flag of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
Similarly, in the Red Fort in October, 2018, all will be surprised to raise the Tricolor Flag in the Red Fort as it is normal to raise the flag on 15th August.
Now the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Azad Hind Government has been celebrated.
Netaji got a place in the hearts of all Indians through a seamark like Delhi Chalo, Tummy Khun Do, Mym Tummy Asadi Dunga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom).
Needs have been raised over the years to provide files related to Netaji to the common man.
I'm glad I could do it.
I remember Netaji's family together on the day of his visit to the Prime Minister's residence.
We talked about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am happy that I have been trying to develop several places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur roads related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi, you must go to see these places.
Dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life in Mann Ki Baat.
He also chose radio to interact with the people and in 1942 Subhas Babu Azad Hind Radio started.
I understand that this radio station had broadcast news papers every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pasto and Urdu.
In this radio station, Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas played a great role.
Ordinary people liked the programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio.
These programmes were also encouraging the freedom fighters.
The Drishyakala Museum is also organised in this Kranti Temple.
I have tried to describe Indian art and culture in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the Museum where more than 450 centuries old paintings and other art forms have been kept.
The museum depicts excellent compositions of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnendranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherji.
I urge you all to go there and surely compose the compositions of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering why when I talk about art, Gurudev Tagore's great compositions want to be done.
You may have ever known as a writer and a musician about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, and has drawn a lot of natural scenes, and after that he has inscribed human nature in Canvas through art.
It is important to mention that Gurudev has not named many of his compositions.
He used to think that those who see his paintings should understand the paintings themselves and know the message he gave in it through his own vision.
His pictures are exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
Our magnificence is a message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through our thoughts and actions.
Saint Ravidas was such a great man.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
The Dohas of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the sacred soil of Varanasi.
Through his messages, he was trying to convince the importance of hard work and those who worked throughout his life.
Many young scientists of the country have contributed to our space programmes and space programmes.
Today, we are proud that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets are making silos.
On 24th January, the art of our students has been launched.
Sounding rockets created by students in Odisha have also been established.
The country has started space missions since independence to 2014 in the last four years.
We have established a world record of launching 104 satellites through the same environmental vehicle.
We are going to ensure Indias presence in the moon soon through Chandrayaan-II.
Our country uses space technology to protect the lives and property of the people.
Be it climate change, railways and road safety, space technology is getting immense help.
Naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which helps in their safety and economic development.
We use space technologies to bring government services to the people and to ensure their responsibilities effectively.
Around 40 lakh houses in 23 States have been tagged under Housing for All.
At the same time, about three and a half crore earthquakes have been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are today symbols of the growing strength of the country.
Through our competitive satellite launch service, India is today launching satellites not from developing countries but from developing countries.
Skies and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programmes provide an opportunity to think bigger and go beyond the limitations that were considered impossible today.
This is also a vision of observing stars for our children and inspiring new stars.
6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune in January.
This time in Khelo India, sportspersons from all States have performed well in their own way.
Life of many medal winners is a strong inspiration.
Young sportsperson at Gustti won the Akash Gorkha Silver Medal and I read that Akash's father, Akshay Ji, works as a guard in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
In the same way, Captain Sonali Helvi Satara of the Under 21 Women's Cabdi team in Maharashtra is a person living in Satara.
She lost her father at a very young age and encouraged Sonali's ability to brethren and mother.
Normally, girls will not be encouraged to participate in sports like Kabdi.
However, Sonali chose the clubs, showed the best performance.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old Asansol, has won a gold medal at the youngest age in the Khelo India Youth Games.
The daughter of a farmer in Karnataka won the gold medal in the weightlifting of Akshata Baswanikamati.
When we talk about the creation of India, we must recall that the youth power is in the vision of a New India.
These stories of Khelo India will not only contribute to the people of big cities in building a New India, but also contribute to youngsters and young sports skilled people from small towns, villages and villages.
Dear countrymen, you must have heard of several beauty exhibitions named after you.
Have you heard of the competition that makes the toilet beautiful
More than 50,000 toilets have participated in this unique event that has been going on for nearly a month.
I urge all the Sarpanches and the villagers to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
You must share the picture of your clean beautiful toilet with Mylathar on the media.
Friends, On 2nd October 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country dirty and to eliminate the open space.
My young friends, the days of the examination are coming closer.
Ansul Sharma My Geov, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written that I want to talk about exams and exam variers.
Thank you for bringing this matter in mind.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the examination season.
I would like to discuss this issue in Mann Ki Baat today, but after two days, I will be talking to students from all over the country at 11 a.m. on 29th January, at 11 a.m.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in the event.
I will talk to young friends about all aspects related to the examination, especially the stress free exam in this exam-pay discussion programme.
I will surely put some of these suggestions and suggestions in front of you during this event in the Town Hall.
You must participate in this programme.
You'll see this forever through media or Namo App Lude.
Dear people, January 30 is the memory of the revered father.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country will pay homage to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to each one of us everywhere for two minutes.
Recall the venerable Bapu, fulfilling his dreams, building a New India, performing his duty as a citizen, we can move forward with a determination.
We will take this journey of 2019 successfully.
Congratulations to all of you, thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
Dear countrymen, greetings.
2018 is going to end.
We are entering by 2019.
Obviously, we will also listen to the discussions of the last year and the hopes of the coming year.
Whether it is a person's life or a society's life or a country's life, everyone has to look back and try to look at as much as possible.
This is the achievement of experiences and the confidence of doing something new.
Besides bringing about changes in our lives, we must think what we can contribute to taking the country and society forward.
My best wishes to all of you for 2019.
As a result of the determination of the people of the country, the values of cleanliness are crossing 95 percent.
After independence, the Azad Hind Government flagged off the Red Fort for the first time on the 75th anniversary of the Government.

India has also performed well in the Parasian Games.
If the list of all Indian social endeavours begins, our Mann Ki Baat 2019 will be longer.
All this is possible by the uncertain efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of India's upliftment and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to achieve new heights.
Dear people, we lost some of our special friends in December this year.
Dr. Jaichandran was known as the cheapest treatment provider to the poor.
Similarly, on 25th December, the death of Sulagiti Narasama in Karnataka was reported.
Sulagiti was a woman who helped the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
They have served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
There are many inspirational people like Jayachandra and Sulagiti Narama.
They have dedicated their lives for the good of all in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to tell you about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some party workers told me last day that some young doctors in the city were camping and treating the poor.
Heart Lungs Critical Centre is organising medical camps every month, where there are arrangements for various diseases, free treatment and treatment.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
This doctor, who is selflessly serving, must be greeted with the enthusiasm of friends.
Today, I can say with great pride that the Swachh Bharat Mission is a successful campaign only through social efforts.
A few days ago, some people told me that more than three lakh people were engaged in cleanliness work in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
City Corporation, Service Organisations, School-College Students and all the people of Jabalpur participated in this Mahayana for Swachhta.
I'm the Betterindia.
When I get the opportunity, I must go to the Betterindia.com and try to know about such inspirational sources.
I am happy that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire the lives of people with distinction.
com is trying to promote Positivity in the site society and make the society more sensitive.
Likewise, the story of the success of young innovators and industry entrepreneurs is very much told to us.
Get Positivity together.
I am confident that more and more people will know about our heroes that bring changes in the society.
It's very easy to spread negativeness.
But in our society, very good things are going on with us, all this is possible by the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
He's a 12-year-old man who lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
He learnt to cry and cry with heart, knowing its different heads, proved his own capabilities.
I wish them a bright future for all the countrymen.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Hanya.
Likewise, 16-year-old kid and Rajni had a lot of discussions in the media.
You must have read.
Rajni Junior won the Gold medal at the Women's Gustty Championship.
As soon as Rajini won the medal, the kid went to a nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajini medal was covered in a cloth and put in a bag.
You think why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid did that, the father respected Jasmersingh, who sells lassi at a snack stall.
Rajini said that the father suffered a lot of sacrifices and suffered a lot in bringing the kid to this stage.
Rajan and his brothers are working before they wake up every morning.
When he informed his father about his desire to learn Rajni Boxing, his father organised all possible things and encouraged his daughter's enthusiasm.
Rajnik Gustti trained with old glasses, because the financial condition of the family was very bad at that time.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni didn't get excited, had to learn a wife.
He won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni cycle in Pune has become the fastest one in the world.
The child traveled 300 kilometers a day on a bike for 159 days.
The child's zeal in driving a bicycle is surely commendable.
Achievements like this, we don't get inspiration by listening to such capabilities.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The fragrance of emotions like unity in diversity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is filled with our festivals.
In Indian culture, there is no differentiation of society and nature and there is equality of individuals and prosperity.
A good example of our close relations with nature is the calendar and Panchangam based on festivals.
It will also have information about the land of planets and stars along with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided on the basis of which clander is adopted.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated in many places based on planets.
Gudi Padwa, Chettichand and Ugadi are celebrated as Chandra Kalander, while Tamil Puttan, Vishu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poila Baisakh and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun color.
In many of our festivals, we can see the feeling of conserving rivers and waters especially.
The Chhath festival is related to the sunset in the rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions of people are drowned in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have ancient significance, on the other hand, all the festivals inspire each other to live with mutual brotherhood.
I extend my best wishes to all of you, 2019 and wish you all to celebrate the upcoming festivals with your heart.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country and the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
There is a crowd of faith and devotion in the Kumbh.
Together, millions of people from across the country and abroad gather together.
The tradition of Kumbh is spread in our great cultural heritage.
This time, from 15th January, you will probably be waiting for the world famous Kumbh Mela celebrated in Prayagraj with great enthusiasm.
Saint-Mahatkal has already started reaching for Kumbh.
It is a great evidence that UNESCO has joined the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity to recognise the global importance.
A few days ago, Ambassadors from different countries have seen preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
There the flags of nations have been raised.
People from more than 150 countries will be able to reach this Kumbh at Prayagraj.
This is a big study for the youth, especially for the youth.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago and saw the preparations for the Kumbh fair going on with zeal.
This time there is a lot of importance in the field of cleanliness.
It will be clean with devotion and will reach the message far and wide.
This time the devotees can visit Akshayvad after the sacred bath at the confluence.
The symbol of the faith of the people, this Akshayavat had been closed in the fort for hundreds of years, so the devotees could not see if they wished.
This time everyone has been allowed to enter there.
All of you must participate in the Kumbh Mela, share pictures of various heads through society, so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
May the spiritual Kumbh be a grand Kumbh of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be a great Kumbh of nationality.
May the Kumbh of artisticity and the Mahakumbh of creative forces.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of the people about the Republic Day celebrations on 26th January and on that day we remember the great personalities of our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the revered father.
President of South Africa, Mr.
Siril Ramaphosa is visiting India as the chief guest of the Republic Day this year.
There was an unprecedented relationship between the venerable Bapu and South Africa.
Moon, the Mahatma was from this South Africa.
Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood firmly in opposition to the diversity.
He established Fenics and Tolstoi farms from where the sound of peace and justice all over the world drowned.
He had the power and inspiration to stay in jail for so many years.
Mandela wrote about Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history, because here he started experiments.
This is where he has shown his strong commitment to justice, where he has developed the vision of Satyagraha and the struggle.
He saw Bapu as a roll model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration all over the world, but their ideals always inspire us to build a society full of love and compassion.
Dear people, a few days ago, there was a conference of DGPs on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat where the Statue of Unity is the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He always lived in maintaining Indias integrity.
Sardar Saheb thought that the power of India depends on the diversity here.
Respecting that spirit of Sardar Sab, I pay homage to him through this award for unity.
Dear people, January 13 is the pilgrimage of Guru Gobind Singh's birth anniversary.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
Most of his life was his workplace, North India, and he killed his life in Namdet in Maharashtra.
In the birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last moment of life in Namdede.
In a way, he got his blessings throughout India.
After the martyrdom of Guru Tej Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji got the status of Guru at the age of 9.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice as a tradition from Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a calm and calm personality, but when he tried to suppress the voice of the poor and the weak, when he acted injustice to them, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice for the poor and the weak in the afternoon, that is why Sawa Lakh Says Ek Ladakh Umchidioum Som Baj Tuda Umtabe Gobind Singh Nam Kahla.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice and rituals.
He had a supernatural weaponry and science.
As a warrior, Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and many languages were known.
I once again bow to Guru Gobind Singh.
Dear countrymen, many good events are going on in the country but there is no detailed discussion on them.
As part of the Right India Campaign, Health Travels are being organized across the country.
The programme will be held till 27th January.
It is a matter of great commendation that I have been trying to create awareness and awareness among the people across this period.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean.
Nutrition is the most important for good health.
To start with this matter .
It is important to learn lessons about the importance of food in childhood.
Let us move forward to accomplish new heights for new accomplishments with new inspiration, enthusiasm and determination, let us move forward, let us change ourselves, let us change our country.
In MyGov, Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Delhi, Present Government from Bardwan in West Bengal and Music Scientist from Nagpur etc. were asked about the same question.
They say that people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It took place in 1998.
I was working in Himachal as an organization of Bharatiya Janata Party.
It was May.
It was a little dad.
I don't understand anything.
Seeing my reaction, he said, look, Sab, listen to the radio.
In the past, Akashwani conducted a survey about Manki Baat.
Some of them are very funny.
Average 70 of the surveyed people are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has created positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged through Mann Kiba.
There were widespread discussions on India Positive.
I am happy to see the radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets Mike, millions and millions of people have to hear, what do you want
Their findings are not political in this programme.
When Mann Ki Baat started, it did not have politics, it would not be the beneficiaries of the government, it would not be Modi.
You were the most inspired to implement my decision.
Small stories of 130 crore people will continue.
This country will take new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
When I read a letter, I feel like that.
With two words, I share it with my experience.
When a government gets the strength to spread not only across the country but abroad by launching a Self-with-dotter programme in a small village in Haryana
People from all sections of the society, known as celebrities, have joined and awakened in the new language that is being understood by the present generation, which changes the thinking of the society.
Mann Kibat is not a matter of government, it is a matter of society.
Manki Baat is an aspirational India.
India's life is not political, not Raj Shakti.
The life of India is social justice and social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life and a level of politics.
Everything is political, it's not good for the society.
Sometimes political events, politically working in politics, suppress other talents of the society and their aims.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very easy task for me.
People's letters arrive before all Mann Ki Baats.
My effort is to see maximum letters and read commands before Mann Ki Baat.
I hear a lot of phone calls.
As Mann Kibat's Episode approaches, I read very carefully the ideas and inspirations you sent during the journey.
So whenever you read a letter, the environment of the writer, the feeling of his mind, becomes part of my thoughts.
That letter is not a paper piece for me.
In the last 40-45 years, I have led the life of a ruler, who has gone to almost every district of the country and has spent a long time in remote districts of the country.
The suggestions of the letters that cannot be included in the Mann Ki Baat are also being taken into consideration by the concerned departments.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and media.
The Mann Ki Baat is being delivered to more people due to their efforts.
Akashwani's team is preparing all episodes to broadcast in many languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat with the same spirit in the voice of Modi in local language.
So they become Modi for 30 minutes.
I convey my best wishes and thanks to them for their capabilities and skills.
I urge you all to listen to this program in local languages.
I would like to thank the friends of the media who are listening to Mann Ki Baat every month in their channels.
Anyone in politics is not happy with the media, they feel that they get very little coverage, and if they get coverage then it is negative coverage.
If you don't have any cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would be incomplete.
I'll do it in every family.
It's easier to understand if we don't come in the middle of the old stairs of our own life.
I don't know if a man leaves his thoughts and accepts his thoughts, voluntary.
The specialty of today's youth is that if they don't self-confidence, if they believe in something, they leave everything for it and pursue it.
Often, in the family, people can listen to the discussions about the emotional leave of the youth.
In fact, the limit for speaking to the youth in most families is very narrow.
It's said that you should do this much longer learning, or habits, and lifestyle, don't do it.
I have been trying to interact with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I try to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have a store of ideas.
They are very energetic, innovative and focused.
Through Mann Kiba, I am trying to link the problems and problems of the youth more and more.
Often, there is a complaint that youngsters have more questions.
I'm saying it's good for young people to ask questions.
We feel that today's youngsters are very important aspirations and think big things.
It is very good to see big dreams and achieve great achievements - this is a New India and a New India.
Some say that young people want to do many things at the same time.
I'm asking what's wrong with this.
Several things are done at the same time, because they're capable of multi-tasking.
Whether we look around the environment, be it social initiatives, startups, sports and other areas, the youth are making big changes in the society.
Youngsters who have the courage to ask questions and see new dreams.
If you bring the thoughts of the youngsters to the ground, give them an open environment to show them, then there can be progressive changes in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetaji My Geov of Gurugram has written in this Mann Ki Baat that I should tell you about the Constitution Day.
Vinita says that the day is important because we enter the seventy-seventh year of the constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to complete this historical task.
Imagine that within three years, this great mandate has given us such a wider and wider constitution.
The example of the present time management and productivity is that they have created a Constitution at such a unusual pace.
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, all of them were committed to empowering India and giving the Constitution to the nation that empowers the poorest of the poor.
When India completed 60 years of the Republic of India in 2010, a glorious yatra was organised in Gujarat by forming a constitution on elephants.
It was an opportunity to remind the youth of enhancing the awakening of the Constitution and linking them to various levels of the Constitution.
By 2020, we will complete 70 years as a Republic and will complete 75 years of our independence by 2022.
Let us move our Constitutional values forward and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that even though Indians are under different backgrounds, we should be better than all.
India First India is the first Dr.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have proposed to celebrate this opportunity in a smooth manner.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
At the same time, a train will also run through the path of holy places related to Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I remembered the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb when he attended the meeting in this regard last day.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had great damages.
Our journey will continue.
As much as we are associated with you, our journey will be deeper and everyone will be happy.
Sometimes there's a question in the minds of some people - what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Your great wishes are my great wishes...
Come on, let's go further through this journey.
31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, all of us.
Every year, the youth of the country are ready to run for the unity of the country for the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very pleasant.
I urge you all to participate in the Forum Unity with enthusiasm.
About six and a half months before independence, the world's most famous international publication 'The Time' magazine became a photograph of Sardar Patel on the cover page of Lakka on 27th January, 1947.
They gave a picture of India with a major article, which we didn't see today.
It was a picture of India that has been scattered for several parts.
At that time there were more than 550 countries.
On India, the interest of the English was left uninterrupted.
In 1920, he said how he carried out rescue operations during the floods in Ahmedabad.
Bardoli has given direction to Satyagraha.
Her trust and commitment to the nation was enough to believe him from the farmers and the workers to the industry.
On 31st October, the jubilee of Sardar Patel will be dedicated to the nation by paying homage to Sardar Patel on this day.
The height of this statue, established on the banks of the river Narmada in Gujarat, is double of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is the tallest and tallest idol of the world.
Every Indian will be proud of the world's tallest statue in Bharatman.
Sardar Patel, who was associated with the soil, will be decorated with the sky.
Dear brothers and sisters, yesterday we all celebrated Infantry Day.
I bow down to all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of the soldiers for their courage.
But you know why we, the people of Hindustan celebrate Infantry Day
This was the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and waited from the climbers who swallowed Kashmir.
This historic event has a direct link with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading a face of Sam Manek Shah, the great military officer of India.
On that occasion, Field Marshal Manek Shah recalls the time he was a field martial.
At that time, military deployment began in October 1947.
31st October is the memory of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Indiraj will pay homage to him.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like sports and sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
This is the source of victory for any player.
Two meetings were held in memory recently.
First of all, it is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
Similarly, it was an opportunity to meet the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
Youth Olympics 2018 showcased the best performance of our youngsters so far.
In this, we won 13 medals and 3 medals in Mix Event.
This is the story of Indian sports touching new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has thought.
When he was 8, he lost his father.
He lived in orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, DDC buses were cleaned and worked as a waiter on the shores of the roads in Delhi.
Today, gold medals are being won for India in the same Narayan International event.
Not only this, look at the heights of excellence in India's sports.
India never won an Olympic medal in Judo, senior Lovely or Junior Lovely.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in Judo at Youth Olympics.
Tababi Devi is a 16-year-old young sportsperson living in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a labourer, mother's fishing.
Sometimes this child's family had no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such a situation, the fort has not taken away the zeal of Tababi Devi.
And then he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are many such stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of all young sportspersons is the throne of New India.
Dear people, in 2017 we successfully organized the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
The entire world congratulated it as a tournament that has been successfully organised.
This year, India has got the opportunity to host the Men Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian will have a tea with Hockey, whatever game plays, whatever game is interested in.
India has provided great hockey players.
The story of Hockey will be incomplete without this great sportsperson in India whenever it is discussed about World Hockey.
The Hockey Mantrikan knows Major Dhyanchand the whole world.
After that, Balwinder Singh Senior, Lesley Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilla, had a long journey to Hockey.
Even today, Team India sportspersons are inspiring the new generation of Hockey through their hard work and dedication.
Sports lovers have a good opportunity to see thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all teams.
But in a new era, in a new way, in a new generation, with new zeal, new spirit and new dreams, these things are moving forward today.
Some teach children, some teach the elderly, some are engaged in cleanliness, some help the farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play a wheelchair basketball by himself to help the wheelchair basketball team of Divyangs.
This enthusiasm, this dedication is a mission mode.
Doesn't any Indian feel proud
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I saw the views related to Mann Ki Baat, I got a very attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
In Mann Ki Baat, he has written in MyGov, how the people of India, their lifestyles and traditions can be an excellent example of cooperatives with nature.
For sustainable development, we need to learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our life.
Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this topic in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter of inspiring us to look at our proud past and culture and today the world, especially the western countries, are talking about environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers like goddesses.
In the Bhil Tribal Division of Middle India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship the trees named almond and Arjun with respect.
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
They don't want to save their lives, especially in protecting the trees, but they don't permit harm to a tree.
The Mishimis of Arunachal believes that they are directly related to tigers.
They think them like their own brothers and sisters.
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra see the tigers as guests and the presence of tigers is prosperous for them.
Goud tribes of Central India stop fishing in some parts of the river Kethan during the fish breeding period.
They see these areas as fish bases and they get good fish as much as they remain.
Toda, a small small society in the solitary region of Nilgiri in southern India, has traditionally constructed their houses due to the goods available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peaceful and mutually, but if anyone harms their natural resources, they will not be able to fight to protect their rights.
It is not surprising that the people of tribal communities were among our first freedom fighters.
Come on, let's express our respect for them.
Dear people, Mann Ki Baat tells about those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother of Punjab Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
An ordinary farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh.
But you will be surprised to know that a ordinary farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh told the father of the bridegroom that he had put forward his obligation and that is the real power of our society.
Gurubachan Singh ji told them that I promise not to burn a bike in the field.
You can imagine how much social strength it has.
Gurubachan Singh ji said this thing is simple, but this thing tells us how vast his personality is, and there are many families in our society who convert personal matters into a subject of social welfare.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh ji has put such an example in front of us.
I read about the stone mazra near Nabha, another village in Punjab.
The people of Kalar Majra, instead of burning the vaicol, dissolve it to the floor and use technology for it.
Best wishes to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to all the people of Kalar Majra, who have made great efforts to keep the atmosphere dirty.
You live as the real elite of the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
Om Dhaun Shanti, Shanti Prithvi Shanti, Apa Shanti Prithvi Shanti, Shanti Physics, Shanti Physics, Shanti Physics, Shanti Physics, Shanti Physics, Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Peace , Peace , Peace , Peace , Peace in all the three worlds, Peace , Peace , Peace in water, earth, in air, in air, in air, in medicines, in vegetation, in subconsciousness, in complete Brahman.
May there be peace everywhere in the species, in the heart, in you, in the particles of the world.
First World War was a big event for India.
Obviously, we didn't have a direct connection with the war.
Our soldiers, however, fought bravely, played a very big role and made great martyrdom.
The Indian soldiers showed the world that when the war was over, they were not behind anyone.
In the First World War, the world saw the troop of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost the same common people have given their lives.
The whole world has understood the importance of peace through this.
In the last hundred years, the attitude of peace has changed.
Today, peace and harmony is not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice, it is necessary to work together in the world's collaboration and coordination.
The real symbol of peace is the development of the poorest of the poor.
Dear people, our North-Eastern region is different.
The natural beauty there is incomparable and the people there are talented.
Our North-Eastern region is now known for many goodwills.
The North Eastern Region has progressed very much in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Kirtiket Future Policy Gold Award 2018 in promoting sustainable availability.
Fued and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) is being provided.
The awards given for excellent policy formulation in the region are equivalent to Oskar in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim State has won the awards with the support of 51 nominees of 25 countries.
My best wishes to the people of Sikkim on this.
Dear people, the month of October is the end.
There are many changes in the weather.
In a way, the month of November is the month of festivals like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaiyaduj and Chhath.
Besides, your progress is an important part of the progress of the country as an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode in your life.
