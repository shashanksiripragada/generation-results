Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My beloved country , and my blessings .
All of you are many ruins of Deepavali .
It is said that in this shloka light brings happiness , health , prosperity in life , which observes immortality by destroying opposite intelligence .
Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
In our India, there is immense opportunity for the festival in the national festivals.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something new to this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat last time.
Seeing this innumerable stories of social meditation have been displayed in social meditation .
This day our brethren are in good profession .
She is really Indian Lakshmi .
Ramesh Garu , my blessings are to your mother ' s brethren .
Their strength to the poet Tiwari is Indian Laxmi .
How pride they feel that they put their daughter good paintings .
She brought a good rock in the CLAT test.
Megha Jain is coming , 92 years old Hill has given free drinking water for travellers in Gwalior Railway Station .
Meghalayaji has been enlightened by the compassion and compassion of this Indian Laxmi.
Many such stories are Shering .
You must read, get fit.
You also share such things around you .
All these Indian Laxmis have written a poem in the Kannada language at that time . My beloved country residents , famous poets in 17th century .
These emotions , those emotions , Indian Lakshmis , now we have founded the foundation of all those who say .
How important things , how important emotions , how excellent thoughts , poets are such in Kannada .
Because of the importance of these priests our society is the future of strong identity , energy .
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev is celebrated all over the world.
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India but worldwide .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world who are completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev .
I have never forgotten the journey of Vancover , Tehran Gurudwara .
How much can I tell you about Shri Guru Nanak Dev, but it has to have many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev had done the service done with the unparalleled emotional emotionality .
They were opposite to social evils like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Devji has displayed his message from far off the world.
There is no one among those who travel more during their time .
On going to many places , at places the hearts of all have spent their hearts with their necessity , listening , simpleness .
Taking Sadbhavan , equal messages they went to all directions in the north-eastern west , at every place people , saints , sages .
It is believed that the well-known saint Shankar Dev of Assam also enjoyed him.
They traveled to sacred Haridwar .
Gurubagh Gurudwara is a sacred place in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya of Buddhism.
In the south Guru Nanak Dev had traveled to Sri Lanka .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During a Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the surrounding areas of Kashmir in the north.
They traveled to Uzbekistan , there are also priests .
In a Udasi, he also travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They have been bought in the minds of lakhs of people . Those people have followed their preachings with complete devotion , they are still following their preachings .
A few days Christian about 85 countries have gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There Amritsar has been visited the Golden Temple , Guru Nanak Dev had presented the light of 550 AD .
Everybody has a chance to see not only the Golden Temple , but also to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
Guru Nanak Devji 's 550 light festival is my desire to give more support to bring their thoughts , ideals in our life .
Then once I bowed my head and prayed to Guru Nanak God .
I believe that my beloved brothers , October 31 is definitely remembered for all of you .
If we read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then how strong their planing is known .
Thousands of delegates from all over the country have to come to the Congress Convention in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the responsibilities of Samadhishwar were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used that context to enhance the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been made to stay without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that those representatives and shoes who have not been stolen at the venue.
They contacted the rails , Khadi bags .
At the same time the victory of Khadi was also shining .
Our country has always been defeated by Sardar Patel for the role of Ulakhini in the Rajya Sabha.
On the basis of Kullu , tradition there was a chance of the divisions made on the basis of tradition , they did the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
We all know that the first Home Shakh Mantra of India is a great Bhagirathi , historical work of merging the institutions of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
You know that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the division of India in 1947 the attention of our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag.
Immediately after knowing this news to Sardar Patel, they took tough churches without enhancing time.
The elder brothers, Arkat Ramswamy Adiyar and Arkat Laxmanaswamy were told that the flag would be flagged off with the people of Travel Corps and the first Tricolor in Lakshadweep.
Immediately with his country the Trivandrum was flying there, all the neighbours who took the neighbourhood of Lakshadweep .
After that they would not want to make every effort for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist place .
I believe that these beautiful islands , sea shores will visit you all .
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Patel, has been dedicated to the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is double higher than the Statue of Liberty of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity every day.
The belief of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared his mind , devotion , devotion , apart from this many attractive centres like cotton garden , butter flying garden , Jangal Safari , Children Nutrition Park , Ekta Nursery are being developed regularly .
People are getting new employment opportunities everyday and the convenience of tourists is being provided to many villages in their homes .
Our testimony is to how a place develops as a world famous tourist area within a year.
There people come from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
In the middle of this time Time Magazine has given the main place of Statue of University in 100 major tourist destinations of the world .
I hope you will be going to see the Statue of Unity after spending some time in your precious time.
I have always heard that every Hindustan who wants to travel and tourism will go with the family of at least 15 tourist destinations in India to stay there for a night.
Friends, You know that from 2014 every year we are celebrating the National Unity Day on 31st October.
Today, we send a message to protect the unity and integrity of our country in such a situation.
Like 31 October every time arrangements are being organised for Run Fort University .
In the last five years, we have seen that in hundreds of cities of Hindustan, in the central territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in small tier 2 tier 3 cities, in large numbers, women men, inhabitants, inhabitants, inhabitants, inhabitants, inhabitants, innumerable youths, elderly and Divyangs, in large numbers.
Whatever happens today we are watching an interest , grip on Marthan among the people .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Run mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
That is why you are in the city where you can know about the Run Fort University around you .
I believe that you will definitely participate in the race for your fitness for the unity of India on 31 October .
My beloved country residents , Sardar Patel is sitting in the Ikta Sutra of the country .
Ikta Mantra is like a culture of our life . In the country with diversity like India we should strengthen the ice mantra in every way , in every way , in every floor .
My dear countrymen, how much our society is always aware and aware of the unity of the country to fulfil the mutual harmony.
If we see our surroundings then many such examples are found that in those examples they are seen continuously working to increase the traditional beauty .
What kind of self-confidences try to defecate those conditions according to their own benefits .
How many types of things were talking to increase tension in the environment .
Attempts have been made to increase burning sensation in different voices .
Some people who go to Ninada , importants do not know what they are talking to them only to be famous .
How responsible things we remember .
But all this happens for five days , seven days , ten days , but on coming to judgment a fun , surprising change has seen the country .
On one side it has been done to increase the excitement of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanbhoomi the government , royal birds , social institutions , social institutions , all the traditions of the society , saints , saints , saints have been exhibited .
Try to reduce tension in the environment .
But I remember that day very well .
The pride of the judgement has been honored with pride and there is no chance to increase tension and heat.
These things should always be kept in mind which gives us strength .
Those days those moments , teach us .
It is an example of how much power gives the country to the country .
A big wound for the country is a day .
I also dedicate my tribute to them today .
My dear countrymen, today the story of the household is listening to the stories of every village from north to south, from east to west, from east to west, from the corner of Hindustan that is a clean story.
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his pleasant experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are an hundred thirty crore Hindustan .
Their fruits are also hundred and fifty crores of Hindustan .
There is a pleasant thrilling experience .
Not only separating the garbage in it , making that arrangement is also a very important task .
In it , removing 130 tons above the glacier , how big service is there .
This is also a place where the rare species of snow leopards residing in the ecosystem , where rare animals like Siachen species sheep , wheat colored bears .
We all know that the clean water sources of these Siachen rivers , glaciers .
Therefore the work of cleaning here is done by giving clean water to the lower areas from here i . . by giving clean water to the lower areas , along with this rivers like Nubra , Sheok are used .
My dear countrymen, the festival is a new consciousness in our lives.
Otherwise Deepavali i . . especially buying something new , more less in every family .
I told once to try to buy things available locally .
If we get the necessary things in our village then we do not have to go to Thiruvananthapuram for them.
Once again I tell you many good wishes of this Deepavali festival .
We have a variety of towers for Deepawali.
But sometimes salt gets stuck due to carelessness .
My many acquaintances .
Blessed is many .
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Nobody is proud of seeing our army forces , our army teams .
Any species , any place , religion or any language every Indian is always ready to tell our soldiers , their happiness , Madhuni .
All the 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv and recalled the surgical strike that took place in 2016.
In Terrizon Mussoorie when there was a negative war on our country , our soldiers were given the form of surgical strike .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how our soldiers keep on protecting all the country by cutting their lives .
The main days like Parakram festival remind us of traditional traditions like that of our soldiers in the youth of our country .
It encourages us to maintain the harmony and ethics of our country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of the heroes.
In the two world wars happening in the twentieth century our country soldiers gave clean sacrifices for peace .
With the purpose of running in Shantibat it is an adventurous adventure done by our country soldiers .
India is also one of the countries sending maximum number of soldiers to various kinds of peace Bhadrata teams of the United States .
In decades our soldiers are playing a role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet .
My beloved country , sky pigeons are unique .
On the 8th honey of October we celebrate the day of airways .
In 1932 the very small air force etc . with six feet , 19 soldiers etc . has increased . These are one of the brave and powerful air force teams of our team in the twenty one century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies had also given the pocket of the enemies .
Who does not know about the independence of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
In 1999, the Air Force also played a key role in the elimination of Kargil under the control of smugglers.
In the Tiger Hills on the enemies of the enemies at night and night they made them soil even our air force .
If the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
It is marvellous to show them the help of the people of the country by temporary storms , airplanes , floods in the jungle .
The Air Force stands as an example in proving gender equity i.e. women and men equality in the country.
Now our Air Force has also given an alternative option to the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission for women and I have made this announcement from the Red Fort platform on August 15.
India can now be proud of the women's strength as well as the male power support in the armed forces of India.
The woman as a powerful woman has now become a soldier .
My beloved country Prajala , some days Christianity of our boating team has fought with death for his life .
How did the country save him
You know that Kada Abhilash Tomi is a very adventurous authority .
He is the first Indian surrounded the world with the help of a small boat without using any kind of modern technology .
To participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean he is moving ahead in the sea for eighty days . But the terrible sea storm brought him difficulties .
But these boats of India had spent many days in the sea along with many days .
He was the biggest example of adventure, culture and might. After taking him out of the sea a few days ago, I talked to him in the phone.
My beloved Deshprajala , the second honey of October is how important for our country .
This year October is a speciality for both .
From today onwards we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through many programs worldwide .
Mahatma Gandhi 's thoughts have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhiji had started writing some thoughts in the form of a constructive program i . . creative program .
Later on in 1945 he made his thoughts everybody .
Puja Bapu rails , villages , workers have kept their thoughts in front of the people of the country on many things like cleanliness , education .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is the identity of his personality everybody .
How important , special need of this country has been understood to everyone .
Then as thy doubt is happening , thou feels as if thy fear is melting .
This midwive told by my favorite country Prajalara , Gandhi Gandhiji is still important .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economic power is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we went to buy anything then remember the puja of one moment , remember this mantra once .
Because of shopping this thing I give benefit to any citizen in the country .
Who is enjoying happiness in the mouth .
This is his message . I believe that by asking you in the life of the poorest , weakest person in the life of the person .
Gandhiji said that if my beloved country is singing , cleanliness then freedom is found .
Although he did not know but India got independence .
For example , due to Khadi , manufactured shopping in special cases many people are helpful for the workers .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult that they do not make it difficult , they should use each other .
Lal Bahadur scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science from outside .
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is a good display for the great personality of the scientific scientific science .
At the time of his Sanctuary , his country gave victory to the soldiers , rails , rails .
It is normal to talk about cleanliness while remembering the priests of my favorite country , these are common .
September fifteen has started a park called ' cleanliness service ' .
Crores of people participated in this campaign and I also got the opportunity to donate sanitation with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself laid the foundation of that school .
People of all the classes of the country participate in the labor done on this September fifteenth century .
Let's hear a phone call. "Namaskara
I am telling you special thanks to your phone call.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) i. e.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be completed with the commencement of the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu on 2nd October, 2018.
If we want to give freedom , peace , justice to the people , then it is especially important .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar many chattis have been done for the primary halls of lice .
Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on October 12, 1993.
In some days the NHRC is complete .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also worked to increase human pride.
Our Prime Minister, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has clearly said that human rights are not ours.
In the symbol of our national human handicrafts the ideal spectacle of Vaishno Devi is comfortable .
The NHRC has provided an extensive opportunity for human rights and has also played an important role in preventing the misuse of these hacks.
In this journey of packets NHRC has created a hope , a belief environment in the people of the country .
I believe that this is a big optimistic event for a healthy society, for the best democratic values.
In the national level along with the work of human rights in the national level the human rights commission of twenty six countries has also been established .
This is the basis of the idea of Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - Sabka Vikas - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, by understanding human rights as a society.
The birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan is in the month of October , in the month of my favorite country . In this month the birth anniversary of Rajmata Vijayraja Scindia starts .
I will tell you in detail about these things in Mann Ki Baat, but I would definitely like to make this proposal. In the last few years, Run for Unity is being organised in every small cities, areas and villages of India on the 31st October of Sardar Saheb Jayanti.
This time also we try to make this ' Run Fort University ' in every small cities , areas , villages .
The best way to remind Sardar Saheb of 'Run for Unity' programme.
By 31 October 31 ' Run Fort University ' every work in the society , every place of the country we will give strength to all our efforts to fulfil our efforts .
This is the faith that we give him .
My beloved countrymen , Navratri , Durga Puja or Vijay Dashmi , on the occasion of these holy festivals I express my heartfelt best wishes to all of you .
Thanks.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Yavat India celebrates the sacred Raksha Bandhan festival of India .
This sacred festival is many ruins for all the people of the country .
This festival of Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of love and belief between brothers and sisters .

His Jayanti is celebrated throughout the country on the day of meditation .
The meditation of all the meditations of the country is telling the contribution of the day of the meditation of the meditation of the country .
Along with this science , education , students have impressed you with the dedication of your dedication .
My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers working hard.
The dry trees , plants , dried rivers dried with strong sunshine .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings floods to destroy .
At some places less rains , more rains than at some places .
The dangers leaving behind themselves are unfortunate .
But on occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
We all know the officers of the soldiers of the soldiers of the soldiers running in Kerala .
In order to save those stuck in the floods they did not leave anything .
No air force, no air force, no army, no BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a big role in safety efforts.
I especially want to say about the hard work of the NDRF, how excellent they have helped in such difficult times.
Every Indian has to pay attention to the ability of the NDRF, their commitment, active decisions to keep the situation in mind.
The festival of Ninnam is the festival .
To come out of this danger, we pray to the country, especially the state of Kerala, to give strength to this festival of Onam, to the state of Kerala, to give strength to the state of Tamil Nadu, to the state of Kerala.
I believe that the people of Kerala have been associated with other places of the country , the whole country , once again I believe that all the people of the country have been associated with them .
My beloved country people , this time I see the information that I have come for Mann Ki Baat this time about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, in the Narendra Modi App, I would like to speak to me about various visions of the life of My Gaudi Atal.
On the eleventh honeymoon of August the world heard the news of the death of Atal dynasty , the country drowned in Shokshendra .
He is a great country which left the prime minister of fourteen years ago .
If you want to say in one way then the activity of the last teeth has gone away from the royal palaces .
People looked upon him as the best parlor member , delicate authority , great word , beloved .
Because of being brought to the reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive organs the country of Atal .
Our thanks to Atalji for the 91st Constitution Amendment Act in 2003 are always there.
This amendment has brought two major changes in India's politics.
The first change is that the number of mantras in the states is fifteen percent .
Atal dynasty changed it .
That is why the money was observed .
That is why the work has increased .
These conditions have changed because of far-flung people like Atal ji . healthy traditions have started increasing in our political culture .
Atal ji is a true country devotee .
During the entry of the budget in their administration itself change has been changed .
Initially , according to the British tradition , the time of parliament being held in London used to enter the budget for five in the evening .
In 2001 Atal ji changed the evening of five times , morning eleven .
In the same way you are watching the churches of the states , central states once in the country .
This is a good curiosity for democracy .
Healthy democracy , best democracy , best traditions , providing good traditions , continuously working to strengthen democracy , negligible churches , etc . all these also give us the best destination to Atal .
The functioning of the Lok Sabha is an hundred and eighteen percent and the functioning of the state is seventy four percent.
These rainy season sessions of the Parliament will always be remembered as social justice and the growth of the youth.
In these functions, many important bills used for youth , backward classes have been implemented.
Like the SCST commission for decades, there is also a desire to choose the Outcome commission.
In order to ensure the powers of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the commitment to appoint an OCC this time.
It has also given the authority of a state . social judgment that it takes ahead .
Therefore the parlor of parlor has entered the hard training by filling the bills of the parlor .
According to this without less teeth for the iniquities doing evils at least teeth education is done for those who do girls in twelve years .
A few days ago, you must have read in the courts. After just two months inquiries in Mandashur, Madhya Pradesh, two convictions have been executed in the case of atrocities on girls.
Earlier, in a court in Kathni in Madhya Pradesh, only five days after inquiries were slaughtered.
In Rajasthan also the judges there have taken some such fast decisions .
This chatti plays a major role in preventing unrighteousness done on women , girls .
When we move forward for nationalism, we can bring about changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the vulnerable.
In the rains this time everybody has made an ideal ideal .
All the parlors of the country are telling thanks to the heart of all the parlors of the country .
My beloved country, today the eyes of crores of people are on Asia sports happening in Jakarta.
Asia crickets are happening even more .
I am telling all the sports done for the country .
If India is fit then India will be able to build a bright future.
I am telling the victory of the victory of the victory over Asia . along with this other sports also want to see the best exhibition .
Everybody is the contribution of the national sports day .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with very pride , self-confidence .
In his memory we celebrate the fifteenth day of September .
The engineers of our country running in their steps have cherished their existence in the world .
It is called 'Bhunga' in Kutch.
These houses have seen three earthquakes .
But you will see any harm at some places .
Our ancestors of this house have been built according to the environment here , according to nature .
It is said that pride . It heard me that before centuries , according to the local conditions of that time , such constructions have been done safely .
Now while celebrating the engineers destination we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
In changing time we learn any new things .
What should be taught to the students
Then meet .
In this meditation many places rains are coming properly .
At some places more rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains today .
Man has brought opposite against nature .
Because of that reason sometimes nature gets tired on us .
Therefore we have to save nature lovers , nature .
Twelve Junior football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally it takes some hours to go into that cave , to come out .
But the decision of that day is another way .
Those who do not find any way to come out , they stayed near a small dip inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but only eighteen days were left like this .
On one hand they fight with danger, on the other hand the humanity of the world has exhibited the values of the humanity of the world .
Throughout the world these children have prayed to fall out safely .
Those children have tried to know where they are stuck , in which condition they are in any condition .
How to take the water out if it is not possible to save them in time then it is impossible to bring them out the rainy season .
Unfortunately everybody enjoyed the peace of the world as soon as they are safe .
But how did this protection program happen to be fulfilled , I saw another point of view .
The complete responsibility found in every level has been marvellous .
Government , parents of children , their family members , media , people of the country have also seen calmly , courageously .
In this entire behavior a Jawan of Thailand has also lost his lives .
It is enough to work on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind .
Just a few days ago the beloved poet of our country Neeraj had left us .
Our Indians can also give how much strength to every reservoir , inspiration .
This is the time of the start of art galleries .
As soon as July comes the youth takes steps in the most important part of their life where their vision turns from questions to Kat-off .
The students' meditation changes from home to hospital.
Students come into the shadow of professors from the shadow of parents .
I am confident that my young friends keep on enjoying their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you get out of the house for the first time, get out of the city, get separated from a safe environment and become yourself talented.
How many young people leave their house for the first time , come out to give a new direction to their lives .
I say to all of you that stay calm , spend life with joy , enjoy the mind completely in life .
Small friends are precious .
But selecting new friends , mixing friends , standing those friends have to do this with very knowledge .
Learn new efficiency , new languages .
A student from a poor family of Madhya Pradesh, ASHARAM Chaudhary, has achieved victory over all the difficult competitions of his life.
Jodhpur AIMS Taluku successfully in the first attempt of MBBS test .
And his father did the work of the gathering of his father , and served his family .
My beloved country , some days Christian , two youths mixed with my eyes and dreams have attracted a news .
If we read inside then how we try to bring changes in the life of normal person using our youth technology , creatively .
Once I am discussing with Indian youths in Sanjoj city called technology hub in America .
I want them to do something for the country by thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Using their professional expertise both of them have prepared a smart village yp .
Apart from connecting the people of this village with the Yavat world they have to get any advice , information , information , it has been available in their own mobile .
In a way it is an attempt to bring digital revolution in this village . Recording the development works done in the village by this ypnotise , tracking , monitoring .
The App includes the phone directory of the village, the Department of News, the list of programmes, health centres and information centres.
In order to know FACT rates between the Grameen Feature farmers of this app, in a way, it will be used as a market place for their produce.
If you look at this thing regularly then one thing will be understood - those youths are spending their life in America , the lifestyle there , thoughts and thoughts there , even after leaving India many years ago , even after leaving India even smaller things of their village , keeping in mind how much psychologically they are drowned with their village .
Because of this reason they can do anything properly in the village .
This relationship with your village companions , this relationship with its roots , is a penance for the country , it is natural in every Indian .
But sometimes because of time , far away , situations , thin dust gets accumulated on it but if someone is touching it with a small salt then all the things inside come up again .
Pandar Pu is a sacred village in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
One fifteen-twenty days before Ashadh Ekadashi i . . pilgrims , palanquins along with pilgrimage go to Pandarpur pilgrimage .
This journey is called Vari in which lakhs of devotees participate .
Gyaneshwar , Tukaram etc . important saints keep in palanquin , singing Vithal , Vithal , dancing , dancing , dancing , walking on foot , Pandarpur .
Tirthankaras or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for the visit of Lord Vithal .
Vithal Bhagwan protects the lice , bending , hunting , hunting .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have immense faith , devotion .
Going to Vithoba temple in Pandarpur, the glory, beauty and spiritual enjoyment there is a special experience.
I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable monks like Gyaneshwar , Namdev , Eknath , Ramdas , Tukaram etc. are still training the common people in Maharashtra.
We get a message of goodwill , love , beauty through their main folk musical rituals Bharud or Abhang .
Because of this the society gets the mantra of fighting against the beliefs of foolish beliefs .
The power to see their mistakes for the British rulers is in him .
The English i . . so much fearful that in twenty years he tried to stop Rajdroha thrice .
This is not a small thing .
I share with the people of this country an interesting incident about a Tilak statue located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad.
He said that on August 1920, when Lokmanya Tilak died, his memorial statue is installed in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was selected as the Mayor of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and Venkat had selected Victoria Garden for the memorial statue of Lokmanya Tilak which is called the ueen of Britain.
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Sanctuary besides anyone , 1929 February 28th Mahatma Gandhi had done the idol of Mahatma Gandhi .
The most important thing is that in that garden, the priest Bapu in his preservation is that after coming to Sardar Patel, besides getting a person from the city of Ahmedabad, the construction of the idol of Tilak was also possible due to his dharamshala.

To see these sports sports a platform for seeing their recognition I am enjoyed with our Indian friends .
The best representative of Afghanistan is Rashide.
Cricket is a heritage of the world .
While taking trophy the Indian hair first took the trophy by mixing the hair of Afghanistan on the platform .

It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th honey .
When I worked at Kabir Vad in Gujarat, I organized a national conference with some people who singed the Kabir tradition.
Why do you know the cost of Kabir Dass Maghar
If we die in Maghar then there was a belief that heaven would reach heaven .
It is believed that by making body sacrifice in Kashi heaven goes .
Maghar was seen unconsciously . Satpurush Kabir Dass did not believe it .
He tried to destroy the fool beliefs situated in his lifetime .
Therefore he went to Maghar and sepulchre there .
Kabi Dass has dedicated social equality , peace , beauty by his compositions , traditions .
These are his ideals .
This is the ideal in his composition .
These days also they are inspired by us .
One of his writings is - ' Kabir Soi Peer Hai ' , ' Jo Jane Perjo Perjo Peer Na Janhi ' , ' Soka Peer Me Peer ' i . . those who understand the pain of the companions are the best sages .
Kabir Dass has shown special attention to social opinions .
He used to think more about the future than his time .
There are other Gurus - Jagadguru - Bhagwan Guru Nanak .
Centuries have been giving inspiration .
And they said , The service of poor , unconscious servants is God ' s service .

In the year 1857 in this month only our Indians showed their success to the English .
In many areas of the country our soldiers , rails are standing opposite to unjustness .
It is a matter of sadness that we have said that for a long time 1857 incidents were only rebellious churches , syphilis .
But in reality not only the estimation of that incident , but it is also an attempt to hurt our self-confidence .
In 1857 Veer Savarkar had said that this was not only a rebellion but it was our first freedom struggle .
Savarkar is a personality of many specialities .
He worshipped both the weapons , weapons .
We remember the opposite to the opposite to the rule of the British , and to fight against the rule of the British .
But apart from all this, he was also a bright poet, a socialist who has always strengthened the feelings of goodwill and unity.

The whole week has changed the method of their place apart from their incidents .
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, only the crops of Bulguru wheat, gardens, corn, barley etc. are cultivated.
Because of being a hilly area these fruits are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot area have discovered the way to increase the price of selling these fruits directly in the market .
Because of the excess of iron minerals in all these fruits this iron substance is very beneficial for pregnant women .
All these rails together in Munnar village have been built a government institute , where these biscuits were opened .
Seeing the patience of the farmers, the government has also contributed to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district Almora , Kausani are being provided .
We are listening to my beloved countrymen, in future wars for water in the world will take place.
Everybody says this thing but nobody is responsible .
The conservation of water is that we feel that we are responsible for a social responsibility .
How should we take care of each drop of rains
We all know that the conservation of water is not a new thing for all Indians .
Not only the matter of books but the beauty of language is not a matter of beauty .
Our ancestors have seen it for centuries .
We know how much importance they give every drop of water .
How to conserve every drop of water they saw new solutions .
If you have the opportunity to go to Tamilnadu then in some temples there the arrangement of water conservation , water conservation system , dry construction of water conservation in big rocks built in some temples .

During the festivals, our festivals, our culture, our traditions come to the north.
Why do not change
In these words , in your experiences , in your examples how much inspiration , how much self-confidence , how much self-confidence , somebody has to do something for the country .
All these are the power to change the environment of the whole country .
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Chaudhary of Kanpur, I got the opportunity to know the beauty of this country when he went to the poor people living on footpath, not only to provide medical services to them but also to them for free medicines.
Due to lack of treatment at the time of 13 years, the brother of the cab driver Sadul Laskar in Kolkata died.
Therefore because of not being the beauty of treatment at present the other poor person should not die , he has concluded to make a hospital .
For his goal all the girls of Sadul house adopted , donors .
He gave donations to many travellers traveling in Cab .
A woman engineer gave her first jeeep to the soldiers .
This is the strength of New India .
The point of view of seeing the world towards India has changed .
Today, in the youth of the country, in women, in the backward classes, in the poor, in the middle class, we can move forward in all the classes, we can move forward in our country.
A self-confidence filled with hopes , hopes has become an atmosphere of self confidence .

My favorite country Prajalara , April 14th honey Babasaheb is the birth anniversary of Ambedkar .
The whole world sees India as the center of Naviku , development centres .
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar believed in the urban development and urbanization of India with the idea that industries are being developed in the cities.

Mann Ki Baat February 2018
This question has given an important scientist for our modern India .
Before talking about science, India Ratna Sir C.
His research is famous by the name of Raman effect .
On one side there is a tradition of the famous genetic scientist Bodhya , Bhaskar , Brahmagupta , Aryabhat etc .
On the other hand in the treatment of treatment we are pride of pride .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India.
The name of the main particle BOSON was also done on the name of Satyendranath Bose .
In the meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai - the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence is the best invitation for the inauguration of the event.
It is very interesting to know about marvellous miracles happening in science .
Artificial Intelligence helps in creating robots, boats, and many other specific working instruments.
In the middle of these instruments also increase their intelligence even more .
This technology is useful for glittering the lives of many lices , babies , needy people .
Is it possible to get any help from artificial intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters comfortable in that program
A few days later, I got the opportunity to visit the inauguration of I Create in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
I saw a digital description made a young man there .
I would like to use artificial intelligence in many ways.
The price of science and technology is very important .
They do not have any price .
How do we want every instrument , how does we work .
But through the instrument we do any work which depends on us .
Here human goal is important .
Science should not only be used for human conservation but also for climbing the excellent peaks of human life .
Thomas Alva Edison, who found Light Bulb, has failed many times in his researches.
It is lucky that I am in the Karmabhoomi Auroville of Maharshi Aravind.
Similarly he questioned everything in the form of a Maharshi .
They have also seen the path of humanity by lighting their pocket .
How important thing is to keep questioning every time to know the truth .
I am telling all our scientists , scientists , scientists associated with science .
Friends , at the time of emergency , safety , desert etc many times I keep on coming to me .
In a message sent by Ravindra Singh from Pune to Narendra Modi Yap, he mentioned about professional safety.
In our country, safety standards are not very important in place of factories and construction work.
The fourth day of March is National Safety Day , therefore the Prime Minister had to say some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat program , to increase the opportunity of Bhadrata in people .
In daily life we are not very unsuccessful about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata at the time of danger .
In them - deficiency of concentration - danger happens - one fault harms - enjoys joy and laughter - do not find the bonds so quickly - do not play with security - do not lose life like this.
Crossing that path one can not use all times in our life .
But if you leave natural opposites then maximum dangers occur due to our layers .
We can not only save our lives but also save the society from big dangers.
There are many information about Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody participates properly .
I want to make a drill in front of the children of various schools once a week with the archaeological incidents situated in the cities of Mahanagar .
This country has faced many natural , human dangers of many chemical , industrial accidents .
This time, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is manufacturing major soils in the country.
When there are various kinds of dangers like earthquakes, floods, storms etc. , NDMA will reach there along with the rescue operation.
Besides this they also keep training programs for capacity building .
In the districts coming to floods , storms a program has been done by the name of Apada Mitra for training .
How important role is training , best role .
Two-thirds Christian Lu i . . every Etaa wheel used to die due to hot snakes .
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to hot rhinoceros has decreased to 220 .
Therefore it is known that if we give importance to Bhadrata then we can remain safe.
In the society where there is such a risk in the society I am impressing innumerable people , social incidents , social incidents , immense citizens .
In the leadership of India, BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have done a joint disaster management exercise.
This is the first , great human use .
They should be a part of our life .
Normally we are traveling in airplane many times . In the beginning of airplane we keep giving information about air hostel Bhadrata .
All these suggestions are also heard many times .
But if someone takes us to the airplane , where is life jacket , how to use it , then I can definitely say that nobody in us is able to say proper peace .
There is a chance of seeing them directly .
That is .
But we pay attention .
That is why we are sitting in the airplane, our ears are heard carefully but no one of us thinks that they are telling us what we want.
We consider every hole of life .
We should not consider this Bhadrata not for us .
If all of us are best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, I have started a programme keeping in mind the issue of waste to wealth, waste to energy, wealth to power through toilets for the villages in a part of Swachh Bharat campaign.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galwaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this Gobar Dhan is not only to clean the villages, to convert the lice of animals, and to the central lice of COMPOST, BIO-GAS, but to generate wealth and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately thirty crore . Their lice is thirty lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese animals , lice of animals , remaining centres are produced to produce energy .
But in India they are not useful in the whole level .
The Swachh Bharat Mission is now moving forward in this direction.
A goal has been set to generate bio-gass-based energy from waste available from animal lice, central lice, etc.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmer brothers and sisters in rural India are encouraged not only to see lice, vain work, but also to see the means of earning wealth.
The health of animals glitters , their production increases .
Due to biogas the capacity of cooking , lighting cosmetics increases in the matter of need of biogas .
This technique is helpful in increasing the administration of rails , animals .
New jobs increase for vasectomy , transport , selling , etc .
A ninth trekking platform is also prepared for the sake of Gobar Dhan thrill which provides rails , shopping .
I would like to utilize this opportunity for the businessmen, especially the brothers and sisters living in rural areas to come forward.
I invite you to participate in the campaign called Clean Energy and Green Jobs and ask in the direction of making waste in the villages of Tadwara wealthy, Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about various kinds of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival etc.
But the first waste festival was organised by a special effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The objective behind this festival, launched by the Raipur Municipal Corporation, is to provide awareness about various methods of hygiene, creative use of toilets and reuse of toilets in the city.
Everybody participated in various programs organized under this festival from the students to the elders.
Inspired from Raipur , in some other districts also vain festivals have been held in various methods .
Every seventh March is celebrated on the eighth honey international women day .
There are many programs in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about the growth of women - leadership by moving ahead of women's age.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda - he says that the idea of perfect womenhood is perfect independence - a hundred and fifty years ago Swami Vivekananda's opinion expresses the idea of Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
In the tradition made by the identification of men we participate in the tradition of women . Yashodan , Kausalya Nand , the sons of Ganthari , this is the identity of every son .
Now I got some information from Jharkhand .
In a part of the cleanliness campaign, about fifteen lakh women in Jharkhand are not a small number but fifteen lakh women have been campaigning for a month together.
Starting from 26th January, 2018, in just twenty days, these women have set up a new example by building one lakh seventy-seven thousand toilets.
This is how big accident you can imagine .
In normal life women have proved that in order to convert cleanliness , hygiene culture to the natural way of common people women can prove to be effective .
After seventy years after the independence of three villages of Eliphanta Island I saw electricity in the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists there .
All of you know well that Elephanta island is located at a distance of ten kilometres from Mumbai .
I am telling the government there , people there .
Does the lives of the people of the country shining , enjoying enjoyment in their lives more enjoyable time , pleasant moments
My beloved brother brothers and sisters , Italy we celebrated the festival of Shivaratri .
Now with the artistic fruits of the month of March , golden colored wheat , the beauty of the adventurous mango , all these are also specialities of this month .
How much favorite is the festival of Holi coming to this month in this month .
On the second honey of March we celebrate Holi festival with joy .
The colorful importance in the festival of Holi is as important as the burning of Holika and the day of destroying evil by burning in the fire.
Forget all the diversity of mind , sitting together , enjoying each other i . . this festival gives the message of love , emotionality , brotherhood .
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first word in Manasu in 2018.
Two days ago we celebrated our Republic Day with how excitement .
The students of ten countries participate in this festival for the first time in the history of the country .
They came to Rasar , February , the imagination of imagination going into the space of one honey .
The space of Colombia has left us in the accident of space , the world has given inspiration to some lakh youths .
If there is desire , strong imagination , if there is a desire to do something , it is not impossible .
On this day all women in India are increasing the pride of the country by developing every hole in every hole .
Since ancient times the pride of women found in our country , the place found in the society , their support is surprising the world .
There is a tradition of many scientists in India .
In the Vedasar Museum there is an acquaintance of many Indian scientists .
Our memorials like Lopamudra , Garden , Maitrei .
This is why we are renouncing like ' saving children , reading girls ' but for a long time ago what is said in our scientific scriptures , in scientific scriptures , what is said in the scriptures , if the fruits of Dashaputra , Sama Kanya , Dashaputra Pravathya , then the mortality is available with Kanyakaya , i . . . a daughter is equal to ten sons .
The pilgrimage occurring due to ten sons is found only with one daughter .
This shows the importance of women in our society .
Learners of Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitrei, who are intellectuals of the Vaidik period
The administration of Ahalyabai Holkar was done . Rani Lakshmibai Veervati , women 's power always inspired us , preserved the pride of the country .
Shri Prakash Tripathy has suggested several examples.
The journey of Sukhoi 30 warriors made of our adventurous protection minister Sitaraman gives inspiration to all women .
Three adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventures , Sukhoi 30 warriors are taking training .
Under the leadership of Kshamata Vajpayee, Al Wimen Crue moved from Delhi to Cenfrancisco, USA, and returned to Delhi, to Delhi, the Air India Boating jet.
They say properly - apart from the queen of women in every hole they are playing leadership .
Most of our women are showing something or the other in every hole .
In some days Christian President had started a new work .
A book has also been prepared on these women's achievements and first standards to know about the power of this woman, to get inspiration from her life and work.
This is available in the form of e-Post in the Narendra Modi website.
In the positive changes happening in the country , society of the country there is an important role of women 's strength .
These are talking about the authority of women therefore we want to tell about a railway station .
You can say what is the relationship of women empowerment cooling one railway station .
The entire station of Mumbai is the first railway station of India full of women companions .
There in all the parts women were born .
In the Department of Commerce, in the Railways Police, in ticket checking, in the Unauthorized Sibbali, Point Person, and more than forty women.
This time after seeing the reproductive day Parade many people came to know the main part of the Parade by Twitter , other social meditations .
The view of this adventurous experiment has also surprised all the guests coming from abroad .
This is a form of women 's self confidence , self confidence .
These are our women play the role of nervous system .
Spirits are changing .
Another such thing has come to my sight that our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen an important example.
A definite picture is seen in the minds of Adivasi women i . . a jungle , in which the pictures of women walking on the surroundings of head are seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture of the country .
In the Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, with violence, tyranny, bombs, temporary temptations, Maoists have created a terrible environment there.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this rickshaw .
At some time many women met in it .
Therefore three benefits are being done . On one side the self-confidence of self-confidence has made them strong .
Leave without in our hands , adopt changes at necessary places .
It is a speciality of our society to correct itself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .
A few days ago Bihar has taken an interesting new wave program .
The biggest human diet in the world is more than thirteen thousand kilometres to get the evil methods of the society of the state .
Through this program the opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite to children .
The whole state has contributed to fight against the evil methods of child marriage , vaccines etc .
Children , elders , youth full of enthusiasm , mothers , sisters , everybody participate in this fight .
This human harm from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna is connecting people to the borders of the state.
If all the people in the society are able to get rid of the evil methods of development properly then the society should be freed from these evil methods.
Come, let us all pledge to build such evil methods from the society .
We build a New India, a strong and competent India.
I am impossible for the people of Bihar state , main minister , the administration of the administration there , every person participating in that human society in the direction of their society .
My beloved countrymen, the visitor of Mysore in Karnataka, My Gaup, is worth six thousand rupees per month for his mother's treatment.
It is said about the prime minister January medicine in front of them .
After knowing about the centres of reproductive medicines started buying medicines there , he decreased 75 percent of medicines .
The medicines found in the centres of reproductive medicines available in the market are found to be fifty to ninety percent cheaper than the medicines sold in the market .
That is why how much economic help is available for common people , especially the adults who give medicines daily .
Because of this reason good quality medicines are available in less price .
Three thousand people have been established in the whole country .
Therefore besides getting medicines cheaply there is also a chance of trade for those who do their own business .
Medicines of chronic arteries are imparted in the ' Amritsar Stores ' of the Indian Prime Minister Jan Aushadhi centres and hospitals.
The objective of this scheme is to make every poor citizen of the country healthy and prosperous.
My beloved country Prajalara, Mangesh of Maharashtra sent a photograph to Narendra Modi Yap.
There is a photograph of turning my eyes towards that side .
One man in it is playing in the program of cleaning the Clin Morna river connected with his brother .
The people of Akola have decided to make a cleanliness programme to clean the Mornana river under the Swachh Bharat programme.
Morna river flows in twelve months . Now it flows only in a few months .
Another painful thing is that the river is completely mixed with horse ride .
The shore of the river is also running a lot .
The Swachhta Programme was organised on either side of the Mona river at four kilometres in the first portion of Mission Clean Morna from the first day of Makar Sankranti i. e.
Big changes can be brought through reproductive system .
I am appreciating the people of Akola , the district , city archaeologists , the administration of this work as much as possible for their efforts , how much your effort gives inspiration to everyone of the country .
You will have heard the churches happening on the Padmasambhavas in my favorite country .
Portuguese , TV attract our attention on this matter .
There is a tradition of giving Padmasambhavas every year but the process of Padmasambhavas has changed .
Now anybody can do this book .
Transparent has come to the end of the process .
In order to increase the interest of science in children he has been making images with unemployed things for the last forty years .
It is his goal to give inspiration to use scientific things with unsuccessful things .
Therefore he went to three thousand schools of the country and gave inspiration to the children by seeing the films made in 18 languages .
How wonderful life .
You will also have heard about Bajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh which is in a family of Adivasi .
There was a habit of spending life but he had a habit of putting pictures of tribals .
This very expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansiveness of India .
These pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands , Germany , England , Italy .
The recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of the recognition of India in foreign countries was given to him Padmashri.
You will be enjoyed by listening to the story of Lakshmi Kutti of Kerala .
The teachers in Avid Kallar are now living in the dense jungles of the tribals in the dense jungles made of leaves.
On the basis of his memory five hundred medicines have been prepared .
In making the medicine used for snake snake snake symptoms are ready .
Laxmi Laxmi is constantly served people with their knowledge in the medicines .
They were also selected to make a hospital in the houses of others , vegetables were sold in the houses of others .
Many thousand people are giving free treatment to the poor in the hospital built with so much difficulty .
Everybody should listen to their experiences by calling school , art galleries .
Crossing the books also some attempts should be done in the society .
Every year we celebrate the ninth day of January .
Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa on this day.
Today we celebrate this festival between all the Indians living in India , in all the parts of the world .
This time, on the day of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we invited all the members of the Parliament of the Indian Descendants living in the world for a programme.
In this program Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, other countries where there are members of our children of India from other countries , where there are members of our children of India .
Some Indians living in different countries of Europe are working in cyber security, some have been dedicated to Ayurveda.
I am thankful to the European incidents for recognizing the people of Gunnu , Indian origins , through their medium to tell their information to the people of the world through them .
The priest Bapuji Varthanti showing the right way to all of us .
On that day we celebrate the day of the martyrs . On that day we offer tribute to the great martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
They are not only the principles of cataract .
Nowadays also we see the words of Bapuji true .
If we want to walk in Bapuji 's bottle , how much we can walk then what is the best devotion to Bapuji .
Mann Ki Baat December 2017
This year it is said in the mind of Akhri that this year has come together on the last day of 2017 .
In some hours the year changes but our words keep on buying .
We remember the great doctrines done by Christian Christ .
He told about the most service of Christian Christ .
We also see the spirit of service in the Bible.
Beloved my country residents , in this year the fifteenth Sikh Guru Govind Singh had celebrated the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh .
The life of Guru Gobind Singh , full of sacrifice and adventure, is a good example for all of us.
Guru Govind Singh had preached great lifestyles . He spent his life while playing them .
A Guru , philosopher , great warrior Guru Govind Singh 's utensils live in all these utensils .
And he fought against the hunters , and against the unrighteous .
He taught the way to bring the bonds of Kullu , Dharamshala .
How much he had to lose in these attempts .
But he never lets reach the feeling of hate .
I am fortunate to get the opportunity to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary Festival of Guru Gobind in Patna Sahib in January this year.
Those who were born 2000 years or later i . . those who were born in 21st century come to the forehead of 2018 , January .
You can also feel the feeling of pride in the 21st century .
You can also be the construction of India of the 21st century . All this January is a honeymoon .
In this 'Mansool Bacha', I would like to talk to our renowned youth full of strength and determination in the last 18 years.
I consider all these as New India Youth, New India Youth, which means hope, enthusiasm and energy.
It is my belief that with this powerful youth efficiency and strength, our New India dream will be fulfilled.
New India should be a New India free from the subjects of radicalization, social illiteracy, extremism, injustice etc.
Let everyone get equal opportunities in New India and take all the aspirations and aspirations.
We need peace , unity , harmony .
My desire to make the new India ahead of this new India and how to make a new India .
They decide the way for them , all those who are drowned by their way should move ahead with their goal .
You walk , also move forward the country .
Talking to you, I was wondering whether we start a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Mahatma Gandhi had changed the independence of freedom fighting .
It is not impossible for a person full of enthusiasm , enthusiasm .
There is a story in English: "Primism Leaders to Weeken, Optimism to Power".
I would like to share the best experiences of the people of the country in the last Mansool Baat in 2017 and welcome the 2018 in the atmosphere full of goodwill.
Through social media, through MyGov and the Narendra Modi App, a large number of people gave me great pleasure to share their experiences.
Lacs of forests coming with positive India Hashtag (Positive India Hashtag) reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this fair propaganda has spread from India to the world.
Wildlife Sanctuary , spots are very surprising .
Some have also divided their personal victory .
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Packet-1, Phase-1, Delhi.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vadai.
He died in danger .
At that time we only know our situation .
How much help we got from the government , so that I could move towards cosmetics .
My name is Anand Jadav.
National Highway was established in 2017 through our Bhitar village .
That is why our roads are very known , our business has also increased .
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
Sadatganj district of Uttar Pradesh, Madi district of Saharanpur.
Secondly, the valour of Indian soldiers we saw in Dok Lam is unparalleled.
My name is Satish Bewani.
This is the important contribution done in 2017 .
The work done by many such people from their levels is bringing about positive changes in many lives.
If we talk about the point of view of Sankullu then I also have to share one thing .
In the meanwhile, I have told the inspirational story of Shri Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak Taluku, who stood at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination.
He came out of acute hatred, hatred bag and stood topper in the Kashmir Administrative Service Test.
In 1990 the rapidists burnt their ancestors ' house .
There acute , hysteria is so much that their family had to leave the land of their ancestors .
All around such a positive environment is enough to fill darkness , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum did not let it happen .
He never had hope .
For himself he choosed a new way .
He came out of the opposite environment and came to his victory story .
This is why he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir region but also in the youth of the country .
Even if the situation is not very good then the unconscious clouds can be discovered by suitable tasks .
Last week, I got the opportunity to meet some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
When I hear about their grips , enthusiasm , dreams , they want to conduct progress in any way of life then how much they know in hope .
When I talked to them I did not see anywhere in them .
There is enthusiasm in them, there is strength, there are dreams, there is a resolution.
This is my youth . This is the future of my country .
My dear countrymen, it is natural to mention about the well-known religious areas of the world, not only in our country but also in the city of Shabarimala in Kerala.
In this world famous temple every year many devotees come here in numbers of crores for the blessings of Appa Swami .
How important is the place coming to such a devotee , sanctuary is participated with how many challenges .
Especially because of being a place situated in the middle of the hilly area , forests it is even more difficult to participate .
But to solve this problem, to convert the problem into a culture, to tell the way out of the problem, how important is the temple of Shabarimala to find out the support of the people.
Shri P.
A police officer of Vijayan started a program called Pungavanam .
Every journey is done for cleaning the part of the worship of Lord for some time .
Every morning the view of cleaning the whole of the travellers here is unique .
How big authority , how big authority , how much wealthy , everybody goes ahead after participating in the cleanliness program of this pilgrimage .
Many such examples are for our country people .
This hygiene garden with such a growth in Shabarimala, in which the pilgrimage Pungavanam program will be part of every traveller.
There along with hard rules , cleanliness also runs with them .
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the occasion of the revered Bapu jubilee, we have resolved to convert our country into a Swachh Bharat, a pious Bapu ji's incomplete dream.
The 150th birth anniversary of Bapuji we made some or the other in an attempt to give him the clean India of his art .
Several attempts are being made to participate in the country .
In rural areas , cities changes happening with expansive participation are seen .
Clean Survey 2018 will conduct the worlds largest survey from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the level of cleanliness in urban areas.
These surveys happen in approximately 40 crore population in four thousand cities .
The Survey also estimates the new efforts being made to make cities external defecation free, transportation arrangements, scientific hygiene, changes in habits, capacity building and hygiene for this work, peoples participation etc.
This survey goes to various waters and makes the cities their own .
Talk to the citizens and take their opinions.
The Cleanline App is estimated to be used and changes in various services sites.
It is estimated that by this survey the cleanliness arrangement in the cities is part of the cleanliness of the city or the lifestyle of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also a big responsibility for every citizen , every preservation .
In this survey of Jagboo in the days of coming everybody has participated with enthusiasm .
You should try hard in this survey without behind your city, your place, your streets.
It is my belief that using blue color , green colored dustbins to remove the dirt of your house , dry waste in your house is a good habit of all of you now .
The principles of reducing , reuse , reuse of reproductive system are very beneficial .
In this healthy competition related to cleanliness happening between 4 January to 10, 2018 , this is also a matter of discussion in every city .
Our city - our efforts, our development - Pragati for the country.
Come , with this very contribution we try to fulfil the contribution of clean India once again .
My dear countrymen, some things are very small to see but socially affect our identity very much .
I would like to share one such thing with you through 'Mansool Speech'.
Who has made such rules .
Why is the observation
It is said that when I went deep in this matter - independence came and there were seventy years of independence that we were observed .
In decades Muslim women have become unrighteous but no church has happened .
There is no rule of this rule in many countries .
But Muslim women in India do not have this authority.
Our government has given me a lot of happiness to pay attention to this matter .
Normally, Haj pilgrims are given permission through a lottery method but I believe that women alone should be kept away from this lottery method.
Our women should also get the same authority as men . In the progressive progress they also have to make them equal opportunity to walk equally with men .
Beloved my country residents , 26 January is a historical festival for us .
But this time in 2018 January 26 honey is specially remembered .
This time, on the occasion of the Republic Day, India is coming to be the chief guests of 10 ASEAN civilization countries.

As the ASEAN countries complete 50 years in 2017, India has completed its shared partnership with ASEAN countries in 2017.

In January the sun enters Uttaranchal . In this very month Makar Sankranti is celebrated .
This is a festival connected with nature .
Every festival of ours is brimming with nature but in our diverse culture the nature of Taluku has a different tradition of celebrating this marvellous event in different forms of joy in the form of Loh Dee in Punjab or North India.
In Rajasthan, Sankranth is called Magh Bihu in Assam, which means Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these festivals are different.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th to 17th light .
For all the people of the country these festivals are many acquaintances .

If sweets are destroyed in some houses , in some houses children are put for sweets .
At least we should make the habit of distributing things more in our houses , if we do not need things then in many cities , many A . . .
They reach all these things by adopting clothes , sweets , food from people , looking for the needs , they reach all these things .
In our culture playing games are considered as Lakshmi because the girls bring all luck , prosperity .

You will know that in the middle of India there is a ban on e-cigarettes .
These cigarettes staying different from cigarettes are a kind of electronic .
A kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating a liquid substance along with nicotine in e-cigarette and nicotine is consumed.

We see , in one house the father ' s smoke is also trying to stop the rest of the people of the house without burning cigarette , cigarette , bidi etc .
The other members of the family do not see this smoking smoke .
They know that due to smoking , tobacco there is heavy damage to the body .

Mann Ki Baat November 2017
O people of my beloved country , Namaskar .

These northerns liked me very well .
These children have proposed many things that we have to bring changes in our training system by giving attention to the Kirti Hegde , Digital India , Smart City of northern Karnataka .
If we provide information about nature to our children , perhaps in the first time there is a chance of using their information about the environment .

On the day of 1949 the parlor of India had stopped the state of India .
Because of the coming to the state of 1950 , January 26 January we celebrate that day .
The state of India is the self-confidence of our democracy .
This is the day to remember the members of our state council .
They were industry with approximately three times to make our state of India .
How does the thought of those people who have given life to the country read that church is pride .
How difficult industry can they imagine to make our country full of many diversity .
Is the country free from the bags of slavery that they have imagined with so much wisdom, sense and far-flung vision
In the matter of this state the responsibility of making new India according to the thoughts of the state , according to their thoughts .
Our state is very expansive .
Besides the preservation of poor , teams , bending , backward , tribals , women , every citizen besides protecting their preservation our state .
It is our duty to participate our state .

They played an important role .
We are proud to see the Constitution of India, Dr.

They are also studyed for the advice made on priorities , manaritis , ultrasounds , even more tribals .
On that day the soldiers who lost their lives , safety Bhadrata Sibbadi , remembered all the people of the country .

The rapidity of rapidity has hidden a terrible form because of accidents happening in every place of the world .
Because of acute pain we face many problems in the country forty years .
Thousands of innocents lost their lives .
In order to destroy human powers acute walk has been built .
With this not only India but all the human powers of the world should be smitten by standing together .

Acute , wrath weakens our social system , try to make it small .
Therefore it is the time to stay absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely .
My favorite country Prajala , December 4th day we celebrate the day of boating .
Sindhu river , Ganga , Yamuna , Saraswati rivers are on the banks of our civilization .
Yavat is the entry gate between us .
This country , this land is an unparalleled bond with the seas .
Seeing in history eight , thirty hundred years Christian , whereas the boating team of all the boating teams have been recognized as the most powerful boating team .
In the expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive empire , in the contemporary states of Kella had played a big role in the economic power of Kella .
The examples of the adventurous journeys of the boating teams are available in Sangam literature .
Many people know that after many boating teams of the world , after many years women have been given permission on the boats of war .
But in the team of the place women played the main role of eight , nine hundred years ago .
Women also participate in wars .
The science related to the construction of boating of Chola rulers was rich .
The main role of the sea was part of the state of Maharaja Shivaji .
Several forts like Sindhu fort , Murud jeeep , Golden Fort etc . of Maharaja Shivaji were surrounded by sea or sea .
The responsibility of all these forts was done by the boating of Marathas .
In the boating team of Marathas big boats , small boats were included .
Their boating team was extremely efficient in escaping any enemy , escaping them .
While discussing the teeth of the Marathas , Kanhoji can not be remembered .
They went to a high level of the boating of Marathas . In many places he made the establishments of Maratha boating .
In the 1971 India-Pakistan war in the freedom struggle of Goa, in many contexts, our naval forces witnessed their valour.
Some fishermen were saved from water and handed them over to Bangladesh.
This year in the months of May , June , when there was a terrible flood in Sri Lanka then three boats of our boating team reached there for a moment , the government there gave their help to the people .
In the month of September in Bangladesh, in the matter of Rohingya, our boating team is an INN.

125 crore people of the country sacrifice their youth , life for the country to live with happiness .
Every year, on the 7th of December, the Armed Forces celebrate Flag Day.
This is the day of proclaiming pride , pride of the soldiers of our country .
There should be a pride of the army in the country .
By inviting the soldiers in schools , art galleries they can ask information related to the army from them .
It is a good opportunity for our youth to know information related to the army .
It is a possible to gather experts for the conservation of all the soldiers of our armies .
The entire military conservation board will be expended for their rehabilitation to help the families of martyrs and injured soldiers in the war.
This contribution all of us also do the work of increasing the psychologists .
We also do good works for them .
My beloved countrymen, December 5th day World Soil Day.
This conclusion I want to tell some things with my Ratu brother , Association .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The substance of our food is stuck with this soil .
In a way the entire food chain is covered with soil .
There is no stool , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life
How is the cost of living creatures possible
A long time ago this thing has been discussed in our culture . This is the reason why we have been unparalleled from the ancient times of soil .
On the one hand in our culture, on the other hand, there have been natural attempts to be a part of our lives, on the other hand, some scientific methods have become a part of our lives.
Both our soil devotion, scientific protection and conservation are important in the lives of the farmers of this country.
It is a matter of pride to enjoy the tradition of rails in our country , to enjoy modern science , to enjoy modern science .
I have heard about the farmers of Tohu village in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh and Bhoranj Black.
It is said that some rails of the village have been able to test their soil at times , which kind of red nutrition , nutritional reddenings , central reddenings have been done .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
Along with this the soil has also shining in the quality of soil .
If we want to think about the fruit then precaution should be precautioned in front of the earth , we save the earth , we have also known our rails .
All our rails all over the country understood their soil more properly , according to which the soil health cards have been taken on ten crores .
We worship the earth but how much the health of the earth is destroyed with the races .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the reason of more red radicals than required the earthquake would be harmed .
Global warming , changes in weather , we all feel .
At some time before Deepavali the winters used to come . Now coming to December the cold slowly .
But as soon as winters start we do not want to come out of all the races . It is a experience for all of us .
Because of this child going to 30,40 houses everyday, Kumhari village was freed from excretion of defecation .
In the direction of hygiene the small child has done how inspirational work .

Children , elderly , women , men are important for everyone .
Everybody needs to do something for cleanliness .
Our Divyang brothers , sisters are determined .
The capables , adventures can imagine anything .
You can learn something or the other every moment from them.
These are queens of every hole .
Our Divya brothers do not take any social problems in sports , some social problems .
You will remember that our Divyang sportspersons have won four medals in Rio Olympics.
Blind T-20 is standing in the world cup .
Different kinds of competitions are happening in the country .

In our country also an attempt is made to remind the interesting incidents of the past year in the media .
Distribute things giving inspiration to others .
If you want to participate good things , then it gives the mind to do good work .
Good things give strength to good things .
The power of this committee , its effect has been seen all of us together .
In the mind of coming I definitely try to give all the people of the country the things that came in this positive form .
My beloved countrymen, in the coming month, I will come among you with words.
Once there is a chance of telling a lot of complications .
Manki Baat : Talking in mind .
This festival is completely celebrated with the natural worship of this chest puja , nature .
During this worship of sunrise , water is worshipped . utensils , soil utensils , bamboo etc . various items drowned with these worshipping methods .
In this festival full of beliefs the message of sunrise , setting sun is full of a special culture .
It is said that if the world is worshipped then it is necessary to worship the people who are worshipped in this chat puja .
In our life how much importance this festival is also said in laughing .
On cleaning the whole house before this festival , cleaning the whole house , river , ponds , ponds , worshipping rivers are also cleaned with very enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider everybody proud of this great tradition of India .
But when I see the impact of the words in mind in the people, I believe that the words in the mind of the people of the country have become an hundred percent strong bond.
Take the example of Khadi , fish .
During Gandhi Jayanti I have done the result of taking Khadi , fishing pockets , how much happy you will also be enjoyed .
On the 15th of October i. e.

During Deepavali about 680 percent increase in the girls of Khadi Gift Cooperation has been registered .
In all the girls of Khadi , handicrafts also this year about ninety percent increase has been registered .
In this meditation youth , elders , children , adults , women , all adults also like Khadi , fish .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit to families , families , many poor families .
I said Khadi for fashion. Now, I saw that Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, all the places for Khadi have taken a transformation.
Besides bringing changes in the lives of poor labourers , both Khadi and Karti are also changing as a powerful means of bringing them up with respiratory power .
How to provide our household sweets to the Bhadrata teams in Tejas Gaikwad also in the Nrendra Modi Yap

Our brave peacekeepers who walked from this land of Mahatma Gandhi , Gautam Buddha gave the message of peace and goodwill to the world .
Peaceful works are not so easy .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata team also have to work in dangerous areas .
Different kinds of humans have to stay between humans .

Your obstacle is right that the diseases occurring in old age are coming at the end of life - they are now seen in children as well .
It is very surprising to hear diabetes coming to the children as well .
This is such a disease that in the past such diseases are coming only to the living life of rich , luxurious life .
Such diseases were rare in youth .
But these have changed our lifestyle .
Such diseases are known by the name of life style .
Changes in our food habits , not sufficient physical labor in life , people are the main causes of such diseases in childhood .
It is necessary to pay attention to this thing for the society , family .
If it is thinking then it is not able to participate more precautions like many others .
Small tasks have to be done regularly in the right way , changing their habits , they have to change their habits naturally .

How many people come to me in the matter of my beloved country , Swachh Bharat , I want to do judgment everyday I have to make a program in the mind everyday .
If you send photographs of small children then there are stories of young hair at another place .
If there is some creative discovery related to cleanliness at one place , then there is a news about changes occurring with some authority .
In some days Christian report has given me a large report in which the story of Chandrapur fort is Taluku in Maharashtra .
There, a NGO Vrind, called Eco-Logical Protective Organization, has organized a cleanliness programme in the fort of Chandrapur.
In this program running for two hundred days people were running a clean program without stopping , without tiredness , without tiredness .
Two hundred days respectively .
Before the program , after that photographs sent me .
This Bhagirathi attempt done for cleanliness is a unique example of beauty , sociality , continually .
Forts are our heritage .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is all the people of the country .
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the people of Chandrapur for thee, their entire Vrindavan.
People of my favorite country , on the fourth day of November , we celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti .
Besides the first Guru of Guru Nanak , Jagat Guru is also the first Guru of Sikhs .
Together with their entire human welfare all the species have been seen together .
Women gave importance to the pride of women , women .
Guru Nanak had traveled twenty eight thousand kilometers on foot and gave a message about the real humanity.
They talked to people . Truth , Truth , Truth , Karma had seen the way .
It is said about equality in the society that not only by words but by his works they have seen those messages .
Guru Nanak had also given Gurubani to tell his words .
In the year 2019 we are celebrating the 550th light of Guru Nanak .
Come , we try to walk ahead on the teaching path of their messages .
After two days of my beloved country , after two days we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
We all know that modern Akhand is the foundation of India .
How much we can learn from the extraordinary journey of India 's beauty .
On 31 October 31th Indira Gandhi had left this preservation .
And he said unto him , He is a witness to do counsel .
Sardar Balbhai Patel has been impressed by standing on India .
Crores of Indians have decided to bring India under one country, one state.
Their decision has given them the power to face all the obstacles .
Where there is need of psychologists worked with psychologists .
Where it is necessary to use force there it is known .
They decided a goal and went ahead with complete work towards that determination .
This program can be done every week to unite the country .
Everybody has imagined the country like equality .
I want these words to be inspired by all of us - do not stop the difference between the kulmatas.
This story of Sardar is also inspired for our New India dream .
Because of this reason their Jayanti is celebrated as the first day of the country .
Their support is unparalleled in giving a form of a unique form to the country .
My beloved countrymen, with a new determination, with a new determination, with a new determination, you will have started once again in your daily life.
My generation wants to see all their dreams of the country , ruins .
Three times have been spent while talking to all of you by sky .
The word in the mind of these is 36th .
I have never spoken these things in my mind .
In this mind I said in the words of this mind , I have sent me from all the corners of the country .
Many of them inspire me .
Many people have to bring changes in the government .
Some personal complaints are like imagining some social problems .
Once in a month, I take your time for half an hour, but people keep on communicating their words for 30 days in a month.
That is why the journey of three - three times in this mind is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , experiences .
In such a short time I am telling all the people of the country to give me the opportunity to understand the ordinary feelings of India .
Now three times have been completed therefore social scientists , university , researchers , media specialists definitely take it . good , badly both .
But in the future of such positive churches how much use is done in mind . A good memory , new enthusiasm gives everything .
After that I told me that many social institutions , many social institutions , many youths were doing such tasks beforehand .
How many people who think that they were able to use the rice left in Kanchenju , how much joy was enjoyed , how much joy was enjoyed .
Once again I saw a serpent in Haryana 'Selfie Vit Dr.' photograph, I told everyone in my mind about it.
Not only in one India, but in the world itself a big park called ' Self-With Door' has started.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing a new self confidence , new pride in every girl .
Everybody feels that parents should take self with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , believes that it has its importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the tourism department of India government .
I told those who are going on the journey there to send photographs there wherever they go to incredible India -LRB- unique India -RRB- .
Then lakhs of pictures coming from India 's different parts have also remained very big heritage for all those working in the tourism sector .
I experienced through the words in the mind how big a small incident can be lifted up .
On coming to the thought of three times many incidents were lighted in my mind .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the welfare of the society , for the progress of the country , for the progress of the country .
I have heard, learned and learned from the people of the country, as part of my three-three 'Manso Speech' campaign.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest strength of any country .
I am bowing to all the people of the country with heart .
Once in the mind I talked about Khadi . Khadi is not a cloth , a thought .
Discounts are given in the girls about two October . very less .
I want to increase this Khadi propaganda in such a way that I want to increase again .
Due to the increase in interest in Khadi, the enthusiasm of those working in Khadi sector and those associated with Khadi in the Government of India has also increased.
How to bring new technologies , how to increase the productivity , how to bring the hands of the hands of the solar power , how to revive the old tradition that has been closed for 20-20 , 25-30 years , etc .
Many people were produced .
The Khadi and Village Industries Training Centre, which was closed at Pambor in Kashmir, has been resumed and there is a lot of work in Kashmir to provide this field.
Now in the beginning of the training center new generations will be helpful in making new things , new things , in the construction of new generations , in the middle of this big corporate institutions I am very happy to choose the objects of Deepavali .
People also started choose Khadi things while giving each other 's gifts .
Some things naturally go ahead , we all came to experience .
People of my favorite country , in the mind of Christian month we decided to celebrate the cleanliness festival of Gandhi Jayanti fifteen days before the country .
This program was started by our honourable President President .
Children - adults , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of this place .
As I have said that we can conduct with imagination , how we are walking ahead in front of our eyes .
Everybody accepts this propaganda , supporting it , supporting its own part .
That is why the jewellery of jewellery is telling thanks to the president of President .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody has done this proposal .
In the field of sports, they , students , schools , art galleries , universities , rails , coolers , police , children , soldiers , everybody joined it.
If these places are polluted then people see the opportunity of swallowing food and this pressure is also seen in those who work there .
It is very good that more than seventy five lakh people and more than forty thousand people have participated in this program in the four days of the campaign 'Swachhta Seva'.
Some results are definitely working continuously with the goal of goal .
This time we also saw another new thing - taking care of one bed program , other bed without caution .
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , then Bhavodav garden is also important .
This time many competitions have been done by cleanliness service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this cleanliness .
Thousands of children have made pictures .
They have pictures about cleanliness with their own imagination .
Blessed is the media of the media when the word comes , I will never forget .
We are seeing how much the electronic media and print media of our country are serving the country in the service park.
In the midst of this time somebody told me about the youth of the eighteenth century .
You will be happy to know that this Bill Dar has been appointed as your brand ambassador for the purpose of the Sri Nagar Portuguese Committee, whether it is a hero of the sports sector or it is a brand Ambassador.
Not only this .
Billal Dar had paid attention to the cleanliness of his twelve-three years of age , last five years .
He is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness in the age .
I am giving many congratulations to Billa Dar .
We believe that my beloved country is born in history , future history , past history .
This time Nanaji , Pundit Deen Dayal is also the year of the century .
What is the center of all these great men know
One common thing is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Nanaji country has left the royal life of Nanaji country , leaving the royal life of the royal family , if they are celebrated their centuries then it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalanji, spoke to the youth of Nanaji Desh Mukh, speaking about the rural development of the country.
Like Mahatma Gandhi 's Gandhi 's Gandhi 's Gandhi 's Din Dayal 's meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last stage of the society .
We should also run forward for unity , unity mantra .
In diversity the unity of our India is normally told .
We pride the diversity but you try to feel this diversity at any time .
Deepavali is lying near Deepavali .
Going to every tourist is a common thing .
But the painful thing is that people do not see our country, they do not see the diversity of the country.
Our country is filled with many diversity .
All these Mahabhavans also tourism in the country .
Before starting this work , attempts were made to understand the country of India .
India is an attempt to live in itself .
My experience is that I have the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
In more than four hundred districts I got the opportunity to spend at night .
I would like to realise this vast India, our immense energy, not only in diversity but also in diversity.
The dream of one India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My hearing is that if you want to go out in your holidays , changes , changes , cosmetics , understand anything , learn with the purpose of learning .
View India within you .
With these experiences your life is prosperous .
Your thought is large .
The cost of experiences is costly .
Normally from October to March it is better for more tourism .
Definitely send your photograph in the incredible tag incredible table.
Send the pictures of humans connected to the place where you go .
Not only the recognition of construction , but not only the beauty of natural beauty but also write about the life style there .
Can you put incredible
You will see, I would like to tell the government that by examining the information provided by everyone from one state and making publicity about the seven places that have come out of them.
The Government of India definitely works on them .
By making pictures , videos , propagation , encouragement of them , the government will accept information from you , how many places of beauty .
Come on, walk with me.
You can also become a big excitement to use in the tourism of the country from the month of October to March .
I invite you.
My beloved country , many things like a man .
My mind recognizes the obstacle .
I leave deep effect on my mind .
No matter how much I am man like you .
Why do the abnormalities say that their husbands are not heaven while serving mother India .
We can imagine how the condition of their inner state is chicken pox in small age .
With the eleven months she trained with hard industry , she gave her life to realize her husband dreams .
Although the husband of Nidhi Dubey had forgotten death while working in the army of Mukhesh Dubey .
His wife also reached the army to reach in the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of this maternal power , to have the pride of this virtue of our virtue .
I am telling many good wishes of these two brothers with heart .
He gave new inspiration and new inspiration to crores of people of the country.
These two brothers were many opinions .
Our country has a big opportunity for the youth of our country between the festivals of Navratri , Deepavali .
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is happening in our country.
It is my belief that the sounds of football all around .
Every generation the zeal of football is increasing .
In any school in India, there is no ground of youth playing football in art galleries.
My favorite country , Navratri festival is celebrated .
Durga Devi is worshipped .
The whole environment is sacred , fragrant .
All around there is a spiritual environment , festival environment , atmosphere full of devotion .
All this is considered to be the festival of Shakti .
These are also called Sharda Navratri .
Behold , my beloved country , and I pray thee .
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand, it is natural to worry about the country when there are violent news from some or the other corner of India.
This is the birthplace of Lord Buddha , the birthplace of Gandhi .
" Ahimsa Parmo Dharamshala . " We came to hear it from a small time .
I have also said from the Red Fort - it is not a traditional belief, it is a traditional belief, it is a traditional belief, whether it is a belief of a person, it is a traditional belief, it is a traditional belief.
According to the state given us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements to get judgment .
I believe that those who take the chatti in the hands , those who walk in the Hinsa Marg , who are a person , they are a crowd , this country will not be able to bear any government .
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we have got the heritage of cultural traditions , social traditions , historical incidents , everything , because in the year some day there is no festival .
All our festivals also come according to natural times .
Everything is directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated every year .
Jain society celebrates Purushu festival in the month of Bhadrapa .
The festival of Purushu is celebrated on the day of Akhri .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
Year festival is a symbol of peace , non-violence , friends .
My beloved country , today everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to the matter of Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .
Balgangadhar Tilak had given birth to this tradition of 125 years ago . In the last 125 years they were symbol of independence .
After independence they remained symbol of social education , social consciousness .
Ganesh Chaturthi festival is celebrated for ten days .
This festival is said to be the symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
The contribution of the Ganesh Festival of all the people of the country is many acquaintances .
Now Omam festival is celebrated in Kerala .
Onam of Kerala is a major festival in the colorful festivals of India .
This festival tells social , cultural importance .
Onam festival exhibits the important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival awakens new enthusiasm, new hopes and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and harmony in the society.
Now our festivals also become their attractions of tourism .
In Gujarat, Navratri Festivals and Durga Puja Festivals in Bengal have become their attractions.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
Think what we can do in that direction .
In the tradition of these festivals the festival of Id-ul-uha is celebrated in a few days .
My best wishes and best wishes to all the people of the country on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festival is a symbol of faith , faith .
In Navbharata festivals should be made symbol of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but it is important to change it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village , in the city , in the state , in the state , in our country , in the festivals of cleanliness , cleanliness .
My favorite country , modern meanings are changing .
Nowadays, how many of your cultures, how new your thoughts are, everything has become a new angle, a new measure, a balance has been created for the berries.
Therefore in the days of this festival the Ganesh Ganesh Garden has started according to the environment at all places .
If you see in YouTube then children in every house are making soil and coloring it .
Some vegetable colors , some colorful papers are stuck .
The media house is also giving inspiration to the people by making the idols of Ganesh idols according to the highest environment .
See how big change has come .
A pleasant change.
As I said , our country is filled with marvellous thoughts of crores of crores of crores .
Somebody gets very enjoyed by doing new discovery .
Who told me that the engineer himself , he got some special kinds of soil , by mixing it , giving training to people making soil .
After worshiping that Ganesha is performed in a small bucket , the statue melts in water immediately .
Three years ago I started the cleanliness park . Its coming to October will be completed three times .
The consequences of this park are seen according to Taluku .
The construction of the houses has reached about 67 from 39 to about 67.
It is said that more than two lakh thirty thousand villages , Bahraang had been freed from excretion .
There has been severe floods in Gujarat in Madhya Pradesh.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of floods very bad odour spread .
At such a time, in Dhanera in Banaskanta district of Gujarat, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers cleaned twenty-two gates and three mosques in Dussehra.
Everybody saved their sweat .
If the attempts to dedicate themselves to the epidemic then our country can fly at a height of more than a permanent nature .
In a way Deepavali , Navratri , Durga Puja is considered it before worshipping it .
Go to the nearby bus terminus , go to the nearby village , but do this as a garden .
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.

My beloved country , I want to accept all of you especially .
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you that for so long you are not associated with the words in my mind, I am very happy and I am grateful to you that lakhs of people from all over the country are meeting me with the programme 'Manso Baat'.
The number of listeners is in crores but lakhs of people are coming to north , messages are sending messages through phones . This is my big desire .
I have become a big opportunity to know the words of the mind of all the people of the country .
The more you wait for talking in your mind, the more I wait for your messages.
They come to work for the work of doing .
Once some things get so much connected in our habits , we also consider that we are pushing .
Prime Minister Garu, I am speaking immensely from Pune.
I want to tell about my friend.
When she is trying to help the people , but a habit of her own habit has troubled me .
I went to the shopping mall once with him.
He spent two thousand rupees easily on one sari .
450 per pizza but with the auto driver who went to the shopping mall, he made a bargain for five rupees.
On the way vegetables were bought . On one vegetable Bermadi 4,5 ruptures were left .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if we go to shopping in Shorum then Berala but if someone comes to work with poor people then there is no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think what the poor wants
There is no importance of two rupees in your life , five rupees but how deep your habit of this small habit can be wounded .
I am grateful to you, Madam, for telling me through your phone call.
It is believed that my country is also a habit of producing such a habit with their poor , they must change .
My beloved youth , August 29th honey is celebrated throughout the country on the day of national sports .
This is the birthplace of great hockey sports , hockey mantra , Major Dhyan Chand .
How much service he did for the sports of Haki
The reason for remembering this thing is that my desire to fulfil our country 's emotional sports .
Sports should be a part of our life .
The youth of the world is also seen in the field of youth sports .
In one way it is a big medicine for mixing the minds of sports .
Our country should come forward in the world of youth sports . I have warned that the playing field is very important in the computer age .
Play FIFA in the computer but also in the outside field whenever you feel with football.
Cricket is playing in computer but the joy of playing cricket below the sky in the open field is different .
At one time the children of the house go out , when they ask .
Now the situation is such that children in the house are also drowned in seeing phones , cartoon films or mobile games are stuck .
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent portal for exploring and glittering the sports talent.
Where the talented children of sports are in the country, their success in sports can be uploaded with biodeta or video in this portal.
The select excitement gives training to the sports of sports .

The name of this proposal is ' Navika Sagar Parikrama ' .
They return to India after a few months or a few months after the whole world.
The journey of our six girls between the waves of the sea has become the first incident of the world .
Does the Indian pride to see these girls
I want to share their experiences with the people of the country .
I will also set up a department for their experiences to read yourself in the Narendra Modi App.
Because in one way the story of adventure , swimming experiences . It is my pleasure to include the words of these girls .

My beloved country , September , September , we celebrate all the meditation day .
A student , pundit , a politician , the President of India used to consider every moment as a study .
In his students creative emotional feeling , knowledge Taluku is the most important quality of being awakened in a study .
Everybody should wipe with some or the other contact .
Look at the way to make it successful therefore enjoy the enjoyment of success in life .
Such environment can make our schools , our art galleries , our educational institutions .
If we talk about change in our country , talking about family then the teacher remembers about society .
The teacher has a very big role in change .

Prime Minister Garu, my name is Dr.
The condition of Annaya .

I have a special interest on the economic objects of financial inclusion , social economic objects related to it .
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Financial Inclusion, is a discussion with scholars from the world's economic world.
On 28th August I started this propaganda with a dream of my mind .
Tomorrow, on 28th August, this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will complete three years.
The new families of thirty crores of new families were opened by this .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He has changed his habit . He is going to the bank .
But now due to the atmosphere made gradually he also understood that money is working for the needs of children .
It is understood that in the days of coming if you want to do something good work then money will work .
The poor now seeing the rope card in his pocket , seeing himself like rich people , if there is a credit card in the pocket , then it is satisfied that there is a card in my pocket .
It is considered its pride .
In the prime minister Jan Dhan Yojana approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees were included in the banks by our poor .
In a way this is their power in the days of the coming of the poor .
Those who have become expensive by the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana , they have also got the benefit of insurance .
On the occurrence of lice , if the main person dies in the family , in some days he gets two lakh rupees .
Jan Dhan Yojana Valla , Insurance Valla , Rupee card , Prime Minister Mudra Path , which benefits the common people , they have done survey .
I try to bring them to you .
Due to such inspirational incidents the media can also get complete benefit .
Such people can give new inspiration to new generations by prasading their face .
My dear countrymen, once again forgive you all if you are suffering from pain .
Man 's mind is very important in rainy season .
Animals , birds , wolves , nature , everybody changes with rainy season .
With the changing cycle, there is a change in the environment and its effect is also very fast.
In the last few days, natural calamities have been faced due to excessive rainfall in Assam, Northeast, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal.
My friends of the Cabinet are also reaching the place wherever possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the problems of floods in their own methods .
In such a situation the help of people , social institutions , cultural institutions , services are helping them with their hands .
The Government of India is happy to help the soldiers of Military Jawans , Air Force , NDRF , Armed Forces at such times .
Due to floods life becomes very impossible .
Fruits , animals , monuments , roads , electricity , information etc all are affected .
Especially when our rail brothers , fruits were damaged then they made plans to make insurance companies , especially for the rails , to make clinical centres immediately , they were ready to stay in front .
In order to face the situations of flood the control room of 24 hours is working continuously for 1078 .
People also tell their problems .
Gradually if we do our work according to these environmental suggestions then we can save us from damages.
When I am ready for the Manaso Baat programme, I am expecting more people of the country than me.
I heard your Chartered Accountants day , I was very impressed .
Last month, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has come into force in our country.
So can you tell me whether the government has expected results for the past months or not
I want to know your thoughts in this matter .
I am very happy and enjoyed when I come to the north from any poor because of GST, how much they are getting cheaper in the things they are buying necessity, how much things are getting cheaper.
Especially the trade of yoga is increasing on the businessmen .
I am sure how much GST has been affected in transport and logistics sector.
How fast changes occurring , fast magranation registration has produced a new belief in the country .
The economists and technologists of the economic system have studied the use of GST in India and will surely stand before the world as a specimen.
This is a Case Study of all the universities of the world .
Because with such a big height , such a great change , with the help of such crores of people it is a very big task to run ahead in this large country .
The world definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions are taken concentration by mixing state , central governments .
There is no weight in the lice of lice that is the result of the concentration of that concentration .
Whatever was the price before GST, what is the price in the new circumstances, all the things that are at the same time, you can easily know through your mobile phones in GST yp.
How much good , friendly environment has been created between the government , businessmen , how important role has been played between the government , government .
I am telling all the midwives participating in this program , all the departments , central governments , state governments , all my heart best wishes .
GST is an important example of Indias overall energy.
If you want to say in a way , this is a social culture .
For making such a big effort successfully once I am making the fort for all the people of crores of countries .
Beloved my country residents , August i . . the month of Victoria .
We were listening to the help of 1 August 1920 naturally .
The uit India Movement started on 9th August, 1942, which is also called August Revolution.
The independence of 1547 August came to the country .
Seeing in a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also specially engraved with the history of freedom fighting .
What happened in August 9th century in 1942 our new generation should know .
From 1857 to 1942 the people of the country were drowned with the freedom struggle for independence, which was inspired by our future India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians have driven their lives into the flow of garden with a mantra "Doo R.
Lacs of youths stopped their readings , books .
The great men like Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan played a big role in the park.
The help prevention campaign in 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942, both of which show us two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
The rapidity of the movement in 1942 has grown so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi also gave a mantra "Doo R.
If we roam around the history of India once , then I think that the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857 .
Then the initial freedom struggle of 1942 is happening some or the other corner of the country .
This long time has created independence in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody has become ready to decide something or the other .
This industry , conservation done in 1857 AD reached the last stage of 1942 .
The uit India Park has changed so much that in the other five decades the British had to leave the country in 1947 .
On 1857 AD this independence reached to all the people of this independence .
Besides this in 1942 along with the five decades of 1947 all the people were decided with one mind , contribution to give independence to the country .
These five are like a burst .
Now I will meet you with one guide .
In 1947 we got freedom .
Now 2017 .
Approximately fifty years have passed .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , Marai , increased .
Everybody tried to get out of the country in their own methods .
I had seen that from 2017 to 2022 I had also been associated with the contribution of five decades .
Try to complete them .
As five years from 1942 to 1947 were milestones for the independence of the country
These five miles i . . from 2017 to 2022 India should also be done for the future of India .
After five decades we celebrate the independence of the country .
Therefore all of us should make a strong determination .
2017 should be done in our contribution year .
Every Indian, social institutions, regional departments of local institutions, schools, art galleries, various institutions, everybody will also resolve for a New India.
Come , we are a part of this culture .
Wherever we are, we are in the online, therefore, today I especially invite my young friends and my young colleagues to come forward to support them in creative ways for the creation of a New India.
Take video , posts , blags , new thoughts using technology .
We repeated this propaganda as a population .
We will also explore uit India uiz for young friends in the NarendraModiApp.
This uiz is useful to introduce the freedom fighters by connecting the youth with the history of our country .
I believe that you will definitely make an extensive publicity for this effort, spread all directions.
My dear countrymen, on the 15th of August, the Red Fort will have the opportunity to speak to the people of the country as the 'Principle Service'.
The voice of hundred crore people from the Red Fort reflects .
Attempts are made to give the form of words of those dreams . In the last three years I should talk about what things , suggestions , advices , advices .
This time also I invite you to send your thoughts to MyGov or NarendraModiApp.
In the last three days of August 15 I heard that my delivery takes long time .
Therefore this time I decided to reduce my Prayag time .
Beloved my country residents , I proposed another thing .
There is a social economic economy in the economy of India .

When I was the chief minister of Gujarat then I decided to give books instead of flowers or welcome with hands.

Once we take in hand , leave again .
I am telling such a museum which has a historical value .
Last year when he went to London , the British queen Elizabeth called me to eat .
It is a shining glimpse of her eyes in the time of beauty of me .
She told her that on the day of her marriage this handicraft was given to Mahatma Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi Gandhiji , in the contribution of his marriage it was left .
It is surprising to keep the grand gift of Mahatma Gandhi along with the queen of Elijibet .
Besides the smallest thing given by Mahatma Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi , she remained a historical thing in her life .
I know that such good habits come to night .
There is complete transparent .

Sports play a unique role in the development of personality .
Sports are very important in the construction of a person .
There is no deficiency of every part of our country .
If the children like in our families then give opportunity to their sports in the sports .
It is not necessary to change books by bringing water from the field of sports , binding in the room .
Along with reading they should also put in front of the sports in the sports . students should encourage all the places in the school , art gallery , family .

This sacred Ranjan is helpful in moving ahead of this peace , unity , goodwill path .
I am telling everyone the next time .
It has given me a lot of joy to give recognition to many people .
Everybody has adventurous enthusiasm to tell their things .
I could not read all that I could not read , I could not hear at least all the messages .
But I have seen consciously that some try to learn music , some try to learn new things , some try to learn new things with the help of youth , some try to learn new language .
Some are learning cooking , some are learning dance , some are learning walking , some have also started writing poets .
Try to know about nature , living , understanding direction .
I want to listen to you also a phone call .
That is, I am talking about Diksha Katal.
I had a whole habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom struggle then I understood that how many sacrifices have to be done to give freedom to India , how many sacrifices have to be given , all the freedom fighters spent years in the jails .
I was influenced by the remnant of Kirti Bhagat Singh in small age .
Therefore, I want you to give a message to the youngsters about this.
I am very happy to showcase our youth interest in knowing about the history of our country, about our freedom fighters and those who laid down their lives for the country.
The number of great men lost their youth in jail .
In the fight of independence any great man had done a very big task of reading , writing , etc . in the jail .
We know that all the compositions of India are also very powerful for the independence of India .
Many years ago, I went to see the cellular jail for Andaman Nicobar.
They that came to poets were coming on the walls .
He was bound in a small dark room .
How did the lovers of freedom enjoy
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe' by Savarkar, I was interested in seeing the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show, which is very inspiring.
I have certainly told the youth of the country that people have experienced any kind of obstacles for our independence , seeing how many difficulties they have gone to the Cellular Jail , why is Kalapani there
If you are also possible , in a way go to this pilgrimage area related to our freedom fight .
People of my favorite country , in 5 months of June one Monday .
If you want to say another thing then Back to Basics .
If you want to see nature , increase the beter plant .
Who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi .
Mahatma Gandhi said many times, "One must care about a world one will not see".
That is , we should also think about the world , take precaution .
You must have seen that the power of nature is that when one glass of water is tired then how fresh it will come to the mouth .
On getting tired very tired the room opening windows , opening doors , while sucking fresh air new chest comes .
That is why we should also try to drown with 5 nature of June .
Our ancestors are now available to us as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the cause of cleanliness in us is Prithvi .
It is a matter of discovering Lord Buddha that the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom , his Mahaparinirvana had been done under a tree .
Reading , reading , reading , city residents , villages , tribals , everyone 's natural love , nature is a part of their social life .
But we need to contact this thing with modern thoughts , modern thoughts .
In the midst of this, I am giving kabars from the states.
That is , in approximately all the states rains start , big vegetation program starts .
Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga is not only exercise .
Just two days ago, keeping in mind the Yoga Day celebrations, I came to the north of all the governments of the world, all of them.
In the last year I declared some competitions related to yoga .
Gradually the tasks move forward in that direction .
It is a very interesting advice .
Mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , sons , sons , daughters , one three generations of yogasana should be done by putting yogasanas .
Today, today, today, this beautiful yoga gives a new measure to yoga. I am grateful to those who gave this advice.
It is a matter of enjoyment as we have achieved a good experience through the 'Self-with-Doter' policy.
These three generations wearing yogasanas definitely give the status of the country , worldwide .
Three generations where they did yoga , they were doing yogasanas together , I must send me the photographs of Nrandra Modi Yap , my pocket .
In a way it should be called a health care garden .
Since then I have visited various projects in India even today.
While returning I saw that some people are doing a very fine mode . Where are Modi going
If you hear this phone call then it will be understood to you .
Modi Garu , I television , social media have often seen that everywhere you go people take special care of cleanliness .
Be it Mumbai , Surat . On your invitation people are adopting cleanliness as a big task .
The cleanliness that you started from Kashi Ghat has become a garden with your inspiration . "Your words are true .
Wherever I go I make the cleanliness program of the government but cleanliness has also become a festival in the middle of the society .
Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, a very big cleanliness program is being organized.
All these things of the country know how much carefully , do not consider this thing , how much enjoyment you can imagine .
I also congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness program .
Somebody gave me advice .
The advice of reality is very self-confidence .
I do not even know whether I can do it .
Modi Garu, what kind of tourism do you want to decide on your tourism , what kind of tourism do you want to call me Babu , how much will your cleanliness level be
The solution is very good but I should think .
But make such a garden . It is a very good thing to clean so many tons of things which are given gifts .
By doing this how many people can be saved from the diseases .
With the help of the State Governments, with the help of the presidents of the cities, the Government of India has decided to start an important program on the construction of waste.
On June 5th World Environment Day , approximately 4 thousand cities of the country are available to adopt the form of liquid , liquid .
Two types of garbages are available . One green colored diabetes , other blue colored diabetes .
All these work properly in the fields . fields keep in mind that what is remembered in a thousand .
The other kind of garbage , jewellery , iron , glass , clothes , plastic , polythene , broken dungs , rubber , metal etc . come into the dry department of the instruments which have to be put in the instruments .
In the last few days, you must have heard that the Versova beach in Mumbai has become a clean and beautiful Versova beach.
With approximately eighty-ninth weeks the residents of the city had changed the form of this Versova Beach and after the removal of thousands of tonnes of garbage from that place the Versova Beach has become clean and beautiful.
Its full responsibility was taken by Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV ) .
Shri Afroz Shah was gradually engaged in this work since October 2015 and gradually became a big and public movement.
People of my beloved country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , TV Channels , social media have been able to see the number of the government .
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Prince Service'.
Many surveys , opinions have been done .
All these procedures I accept healthy information .
In every test all these three feet were tested .
Every part of the society has poisoned it .
There is an excellent procedure in democracy .
I am also telling thanks to all those who give calculation , special feedback .
On coming to the light of Lotupattu , Lopalu there is a chance of recovering them .
It is good , something good , something bad , learning from it , walk ahead with it in the evening .
Constructive examination gives strength to the democracy .
This Mathana is necessary for an unparalleled country , a conscious country .
This is the same thing that many families came to me .
This incident has increased with my enthusiasm .
Even while sitting in such a big place, I will be able to give so much importance to the words of ' Manasu ' by giving time to the pride of President , Vice President ji , Speaker ji .
In a way, Manaso Baat has given a new corner to the programme.
Some of our friends were also discussed with me when working on this book ' Mansu ' .
I'm suppressed to Akbar.
My beloved country , this time we keep on raining all the four corners of the country .
Come , let us move ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
My generation is many ruins of all of you , blessed .
Beloved is the people of my country , Namaskar .
Probably arrangements , people have become a habit of these problems .
The subjects of children , youths , elders , experiences etc . are coming in my sight .
While traveling in bus , train someone gets coughed , immediately someone comes and gives some advice .
Advices , suggestions are in our nature .
Many people try to reach me , to give advice , to give advice to me some or the other in their life .
With some good hands they keep changing their Buddhism , energy , capacity according to the situations .
Some people know their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a comprehensive form of a comprehensive form and also with the purpose of changing everyone .
Besides this when I proposed anything then it becomes very happy to remember such things .
After that many people from all the corners of the country have made any creative attempt to see the food waste .
I also sent some videos .
There are roti banks at some places .
May is the established day of Maharashtra , Gujarat states .
This contribution is many acquaintances for the people of these two states .
Both the states try to cross many new development peaks . The progress of the country has given their support .
In both the states the everlasting effort , every kind of society of the society keeps on surprising our lives .
These great men are reminding , on the day of the independence of the state on the day of independence i . . 2022 , our state , all our society , all our cities , all our families , all our families , all our families .
Make a plan to fulfil this contribution . walk ahead with the help of all the people .
On the second time these two states are my many ruins .
The rapidity of summers living in the months of May , June in our country has to be felt in the month of March , April .
Therefore this time when I am consulting advice for talking in mind , more advice has been given in this summers , etc .
All these are also published . Not new , but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani had to keep water for birds , Daba Paina , birds .
In many families small children also have seen this work .
Once this work comes in their sight , the birds have come to see whether there is water in the cup kept ten times a day .
It gives us such a sports but in reality it is a unique feeling of reflecting experience in the minds .
Although in our country it is important to give strength to such efforts about animal birds , natural life with nature .
When I was the chief minister of Gujarat then Daudi Bohra society came to Saiyadna for hundred years .
They lived an hundred three times .
For the festivals of their hundredth day Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the birds by their Buhrani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
They sent approximately fifty to two thousand burd feeders to all corners of the world.
Guinn Book of World Records has also approved this.
Sometimes we were not able to take so much that those who put the name , milk , vegetables , Post Man , such a summer days somebody drinks good water in the gum .
Youth friends , I want to tell you some things .
In our youth many people like to spend life in Comprehensive John sometimes I am observed .
Mothers are also ruled in a conservative environment .
There are also different people living in this but most of the people living in the Comprehensive zone are found .
Now the tests have been done , to enjoy the chemicals .
After summers the summers remain cosmetic .
I want to tell how to spend your summer holidays like a friend .
It is believed that somebody should definitely use it , I am told .
If you do not hear this , do not think , do not think , go to unknown place .
Try to new places , new experiences , new everybody .
I want that why is your interest in these summer holidays try to know them .
Give new use .
The use should be positive, you should be able to get you out of your comfort zone.
We are of the middle class . happy families .
What is the matter of those travellers , what will they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to your football with ball , vali ball or other games for moments .
Play yourself with those poor children when you see that sports you will get the joy of not getting any time in your life .
If you get a chance of playing with you in the society of such life then what change comes in their life .
I can tell you with faith that if you go once then you want to go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
To reduce technology , to remove the borders , but its adverse effect has changed that six people living in one house are also in one room to imagine the distance between them as well .
Can you try to spend time away from technology
If we pay attention to the country full of many diversity then we get to learn something or the other in our surroundings .
If you do not come , learn swimming , do not come to the best bomb , try to take something or the other on the ear .
If we feel small tasks then sometimes we could not learn some tasks of our mind .
You can learn to walk a car but if you want to learn auto rickshaw .
You may have to come to put a cycle but never try to move the tri-cycle car carrying people .
You will see, these new attempts , new expertise will not only give you happiness , but you can also pull your life out of it by tied to one condition .
Keep showing indraj to your friends .
I am telling with my experience , how much we can not even imagine how much we can learn from seeing the world .
See new places , new cities , new cities , new villages , new places .
But before going wherever you are going to that practice , seeing a gynaecology there , to know , to discuss with people , to ask water , to see those places it is different to see that place .
That is why you get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the river flows closely.
They do not need river .
They started belief in digital consciousness .
Do you also believe  But do you ever think that you can get through this plan
The Government of India has made a plan .
Would you be loading the BHIM app down
Send it to each other .
If you are done by twenty people in a day then in the evening you will get two hundred rupees .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
In this way, you will be able to cooperate in making Digital India.
New India becomes one of you .
Holidays , sports for holidays .

Normally there is a rare environment of VIP culture in our country .
Now even if the red light has gone on the vehicles , the red light has come out in the brain .
Namaskar, Prime Minister Garu, from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, I am talking to Shiv Choubey.
I want to talk something about the government's decision red becon night bann.
I felt very proud to read it .
Now my time has also been enjoyed as much as possible .
I don't want to get stuck in traffic jam.
I want to tell you the blessedness of my heart for this decision .
Red light is a part of the arrangement by the government 's decision .
New India is expected to increase the importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country.
In place of VIPs, the EPI says, my feeling is clear - every person is inimportant.
Every person has a priority , every person has an important importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen , then how big power is to realize the important dreams of 125 crore countries .
Do this work together .
My beloved country , we have to remember our history , our culture , our traditional repeated times .
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year our 125 crore countrymen are celebrating their thousand Jayanti of Swami Ramaji .
Because of some reason we are not so much observed , how small we think that more than one century we are thinking .
Imagine cosmetics .
It is also difficult to come out by bringing out the social bags .
How was it before a thousand
The Ramayanas had done very big fight against the evil , description , unconsciousness , species etc . of the society during his time only some people know .
They used to embrace the society by their swimming conductors , they all were embraced .
Before thousands of thousands he got permission to enter the house , to give him entry into the house .
It is our fortune to keep the evil of that time in every age from our society to end the evil of that time .
Nowadays we are celebrating the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramayana , we are repeated to the world by getting inspiration from him in an attempt to bring social unity .
To morrow the Government of India is releasing a postal house in the memory of one Tarikhun Swami Ramayana .
I am offering to Swami Ramacharyas by telling the Prayags of Ardarpur .
The beloved people of my country , to morrow is another speciality .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as Labour Day.
It is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar on the day of the labourers , when there is a discussion about the labourers , it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar .
I am telling about Babasaheb Ambedkar , Swami Ramayanas , the fifteenth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of the society of the society is also reminding .
In the twelfth century he had deep thoughts on the matter of labour and labour in Kannada language.
And he said , In Kannada , Kai , Kai , Kailas .
That means, 'You can get Shiva's house Kailash from your industry.'
That is , heaven gets heaven by doing karma .
If you want to say in the other word , it is Shiva .
It is natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi when I am talking about the labourers .
Beloved people of my country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurni .
All the followers of Lord Buddha celebrate the festivals of the world .
On the day of Buddha Purnima, I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United States.
This seventh is celebrated in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer Buddha to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
The opportunity to remember their memories is available .
My dear countrymen, we have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
When Sabka Sath-Sabka Vikas is in India, it is not only in India but also in the world.
Especially our neighbouring countries also come .
The support of our neighbouring countries should be done , development should be done for them .
Many uses are done .
On 5 May the south - Asia museum of India has been used .
How useful is the capacity of this museum , how much useful is to fulfil the economic , development of South Asia .
This museum is helpful in the attempts of traditional efforts between the people , tele-medicine II , educational science , higher educational science , people .
Beloved people of my country, sunshine is fast . Save them , save you .
Most of the families of the country remain busy in the tests of their children .
In the families of the tested people there is an atmosphere of cosmetic climate , testing in the families of the family .
At such a time, once again listen to what I have spoken to the students in the Manaso.
In a historical war happening opposite to unrighteousness Bangladesh was successful in the leadership of Bangladesh .
On such a special day the brothers of Bangladesh , brothers , brothers , brothers , brothers , sisters of Bangladesh want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
India continues to provide full support to Bangladesh as a strong partner, a good friend with you, to protect peace and security in this Yawat region and to take steps towards development.
The memories of our Ravindranath Tagore are the pride of giving the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the creation of our Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore .
An interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that he was the first person who gave the Nobel Prize in 1913 and also gave him a knighthood title.
In 1919 when the British created Maranhom in Jalianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore was also one of the great men who were opposite to him .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of one twelve children .
In the childhood to spend playing this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 this small Bhagwan situated in twelve is the favorite , inspired Amarvir Bhagat Singh .
Three days Christian March , 23th honey of Bhagat Singh , he had climbed the English of Sukhdev , Rajguru .
This incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , without the death of three , we all know that the joy of serving the mother of India is left .
We can not even keep the story of the life of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru in Akshay Kshetra .
The Empire of Yavat was afraid of these three .
After training they were in jail , how much worry was the British .
Therefore everybody had to implement the training of 24th honey in the month of March , on 23th March the training was done on the day of March .
Besides this their dead bodies were thirsty by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time, there was a kind of consequence in my body.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I suggest to the youth of the country to visit the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and the tombs of Batkeshwar Datt.
At that time it is called for freedom , its rapidity , its quantity is increasing .
On the one hand, these people like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired the youth to fight against the war.
The truth of these was done by Mahatma Gandhi Champaran Satyagraha on the 10th day of 1917 April .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha .
In the fight of independence of India Gandhi Vada , Gandhiji 's behavior style was known for the first time during Champaran .
Specially this incident is a milestone in the entire journey of fighting for independence in Taluku methods .
Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Million Carmittee in Ahmedabad, all these have a strong impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and behavior style.
A man who returned to India in 1915 had only two works.
The power to know the nervous system of the population , Indian society , by its way the poor people of the British empire , one for fighting , inspiring , fighting , fighting , fighting , fighting for fighting , etc . Mahatma Gandhi had displayed the marvellous powers of Gandhiji .
If we know about Gandhiji 's life during the Champaran Satyagraha happening a hundred years ago , then how much is the estimation of Champaran Satyagraha to know about Gandhiji 's life .
How to start ordinary life , how much industry itself , Gandhiji had done it from him .
We were sent to the village of Gandhiji at the same time as Rajendra Babu , Acharya Kripalani .
How to teach the color of freedom fighting in the work of people , people working with people .
A wonderful balance is in the work style of Gandhiji .
The desire of hundred crore people to bring changes , attempts , efforts of new India , India is a strong foundation of India .
There's a desire, a resolution, a enthusiasm.
My dear countrymen, if we come out of the lives of cosmetic mind, seeing the works being done in the society with cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetic cosmetics, seeing what happens in the society , seeing what happens around , seeing what happens , seeing what happens , seeing the goal of the goal of the goals , not only for the society , but for the society , for the adverse effects of the society , for the adverse effects of the society , for the adverse effects of the society .
That is also a penance , meditation , a silent service they are doing their work .
There are many people who serve the patients everyday by going to the hospital .
Those who run along with blood donation i . . along .
They are somebody who give food to food .
Once seeing it in a collective form , incidents it is known with such a big shape .
All these are not able to celebrate with the budget evening , government projects , government money .
But when you see the country then you will see the dream of a New India in front of our eyes, the dream of a hundred crore people of the country.
It is said that every Pauru should participate the responsibility of Pauru .
Then itself the same New India starts a beginning .

We recognize the Satyagraha of Champaran .
Shall we also participate in the journey of 'Swarajya to Surajya' by regulating our lives and by making a resolution
In the last few months such a environment in our country , very big people were participated in the digital garden , digital garden .
After the rubbing of mouth many types of digital disciplines can be seen .
Only two-and-a-half months after the launch of BHIM App, nearly one and a half crore people have downloaded this app.

I believe that the time of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti remains with us , as much as Bhima Yap is being published .
To reduce the flow of river , to reduce behavior with mouths our part is polluted .
My dear countrymen, I am delighted to have several kinds of suggestions whenever I have asked my suggestions for 'Manasu Talk' every time.

I have sent a message by phone from Deh Ra Dun, a girl who reads eleventh class and has sent a message to you. Honourable chief teachers Garu, Prime Minister Garu, and my honourable greetings.
First of all this very beauty you are many luxuries to spend with extremely Ooty .
I want to speak to you in my mind .
I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
People travel daily on a river polluting a lot of garbage .
Our house comes hidden on the responsibilities of that river .
I recognize it clearly .
I want to be angry in the minds of hundred crores of people .
Once anger starts , we start feeling satisfaction , we apply something to do something or the other .
It is very beneficial , active participant , the garden is so important for them .
But cleaning is always engraved with a habit even more than the park .
I believe that this feeling awakened in the youth , children , students , students of the country is a good result .
We know that we have eaten at home , we also put food in our teeth more than necessary in food .
It is difficult to eat after putting everything in the glass .
Half of them can not be put in the stomach , leave there .
Have you ever thought how much harm we do by leaving these narrow things
If you do not leave it by swallowing , everyone can fill the stomach of lice , never think .
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that when small children in our houses can eat as much as they can eat .
But such thing is that it is also good for family .
They made some mobile yps .
You will see such people at some places in every state of our country .
The life of their life also does not leave us , as much as we can eat , it gives sports .
Look , these paths are there for change .
Those who take care of body , health they say that keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the glass .
Health matter therefore April 7th Tarikh is the world health day .
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This time April 7th Tarikh World Health Organisation has been paid attention to depression .
According to an estimate 35 crore people in the world are suffering from mental depression .
The risk is that in those around us also we like to talk about this thing .
The person suffering from depression also does not talk about it because that person also becomes ashamed to discuss it .
I would like to tell the people of the country that they would not be able to get rid of depression.
On making a psychological environment relief starts getting rid of .
The first mantra is that instead of supplement x - ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , parents , brothers , meditations with meditations .
Children living in the bathroom sometimes have so much difficulty because of loneliness .
It is the good fortune of our country that we have grown up in the families of Ummadi and we are mixed with big families so there is no shape of depression.
You believe that they are the first step towards depression .
This is the best solution .
This depression becomes the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , like depression also does not stand , fighting , adventurous , adventurous , adventurous ability to take decisions .
There is also another method .
When you meet others , after serving someone , after serving indefinitely , you can easily lighten the weight of your mind .

Shobha Jalan, a large number of people are not aware of the use of ISRO in the NarendraModiApp, so you do not want to provide some information about the use of 104 museums in Gurgi interceptor Missile.
Thanks to remember the glorious glorious glorious example of India .
If we want to discover poverty, if we want to escape from diseases, we want to get information from the world, we have achieved the place that is possible through technology, science.
The 15th day of February is a glorious day in the lives of Indians .
Our scientists have done an important task of lifting up the head with the pride of the world .
He completed many unparalleled experiments in ISRO for some time .
A few days ago, the ISRO took the world record in the space sector after successful experiments such as Mars Mission, Mangalyaan etc.
Once after sending 104 museums in space India has remained the first country created history .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory of PSL .
This is not only an ISRO but also a historical activity for India.
This space programme, run with efficiency with the lowest cost of ISRO, has become a wonderful worldwide
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the heart of the whole world .
Brothers and sisters , these 104 museums are the main museum of India .
How useful is the pictures , wildlife mapping , economic estimations , development plans , city development plans etc .
Especially for my Ratu brothers and sisters where water sources are there in the country , how to use them , how to keep in mind the important things that cartosat 2D helps us .
We sent some pictures while going to our Shatilate .

In the area of protection also India Balistic interference has been tested successfully .
Interception technology has achieved victory by recognizing the tuberculosis of enemies from a height of about 100 kilometres from the ground as part of their use.
Our scientists of India have seen this .
Moreover, its power is such that if a missile comes to capture India from a distance of 2000 kilometres then our mission has the power to destroy it in space.
On seeing new technology , we enjoy some scientific success .
In the journey of human life Taluku development Jijnas played a very important role .
Special scientific , everybody does not let their gynaecology be like a gynaecology .
The same gynaecology becomes the cause of new discovery .
Their questions are not able to sleep .
If we discover the journey of development of thousands of years of human life , then we can say that there is no such thing for the development of this human life .
That is impossible .
All Brahmanda , creation rules , man 's mind is constantly trying to know .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My beloved youth, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientific scientists, I have come to know that many times in our youth we have to increase the attraction of science in our youth.
There is a need of many scientists for the country .
Today scientists become the cause of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming generations .
Those who say Mahatma Gandhi have no science drop in a perfect form from the skies.
Scientists should always keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how can they use their principles naturally , what medium is beneficial for them , what technology is needed because the common man is the most beneficial .
I felt that on seeing such creativeness , exhibition , exhibition , giving information to people , such creative inventions are useful for people , how to produce them very high , how to use them , how to use them , etc .
I saw a discovery of Italy .
In 2005 more rains came in Mumbai .
It means that humans playing such role in society , country , country are very popular .
Our society also plays a very technological direction .
All the arrangements are also running in the direction of technology .
In a way, technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days digital yoga has been very strong .

This year about two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  more emotional record has been registered with the name of our rails .
This is so much successful .
I am especially enjoying the rails of the country .
Because apart from traditional fruits they kept in mind the poor people , various types of pulses cooked because the poor get the most proteins with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of the poor people of the country near about two hundred ninety lakh hectares of land has enjoyed me a lot of joy .
This is not only the production of various types of pulses , but also the important service of railing for the poor people of my country .
My prayer , all my prayer , my country , how did the farmers of my country produce the record of pulses , so my brothers and sisters of my ripe brothers .
My dear countrymen, by the government of our country, by the society, by the institutions, by everybody, some work is going on in a clean direction.
In a way everybody seems to be behave unbrokenly regarding cleanliness in some form or the other.
The government is also trying continuously .
After emptying the toilets of six houses , healed them .
Twin pit toilets were empty , then the rulers themselves saw the methods of using those toilets again .
How do we clean other cleansing , these toilets can also be cleaned in such a way .
Because it is natural to attract the attention of the people of the country when an IAS officer cleansed the toilet axe himself .
It has also been proved .
A Standard Twin Pit Toilet is filled in five members of the family.
After that you can easily repeat it in another pit .
In six to twelve months the waste reached in the toilet axe gets completely rotten .
The government takes this precaution , others also use such precautions .
Cleanliness festivals continue in various departments in the government as well.
In the first party of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, is also going to confer this Swachhta Programme.

Manki Baat , August 2019 .
Our country is now enjoying rains on one side .
On the other hand, in the corners of Hindustan, some festival or the other is held in Deepawali.
Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, the cyclone and the economic cycle have set up a society's lifestyle.
Till now we have celebrated many festivals .
Sri Krishna Festival has been celebrated throughout the Hindustan .
It is such a person who has such a personality , thousands of years even after spending thousands of years also takes a new festivity , brings new energy to new energy .
Today I am talking to you about two important monasteries .
One is Sudarshan Chakradhar , one is Charkhadhar .
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohn left the Yamuna coast, and went to the sea coast of Gujarat, and established in the city of Dwarka, Mohn, born on the sea coast, came to the Yamuna coast and spent the last time of his life in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohn used his intelligence , ability , his scientific thinking completely to stop the war of thousands of years , to stop the war , to stop the war .
At the same time, India is preparing for another big festival.
Not only India , this is the discussion of the whole world . O my beloved country .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the rails recognizing in Champaran .
In order to remove many illusions related to the disease of bile they themselves served the patients of bile .
Through the service itself has remained an example of his life .
This thing can be understood straight from Bapuji life .
Mahatma Gandhi was specially the person , society , humanity .
Finex Farm of Africa , Tal Steel Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardha , all the places , in a special way the society of society , committee Mobilization was their support .
We need to bring all these feelings of society , society , community service , community mobilization .
If you want to say the truth then this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We were associated with people in the society , associated with all the classes , associated with all the ages , the city of the village is a man or the society associated with everyone , what can I try to do with me .
The cost of my generation is good for the cost of valuation .
Community is our strength .
It is said that in the program happening in the year of 150 years there is also no service , service .
Our woman is Mandali Ladys club .
In the modern era, we will do the work of Ladies Club, but we will meet the members of the Ladies Club with some service programme.
You can do a lot.
There are 130 crore Indians , 130 crore imagination of 130 crore Indians . 130 crore can be started .
There is no harmony in the mind that it is enough to serve with good aspiration , goodness , goodwill .
It is also a comfortable pleasure - if it has been for an unparalleled joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Salt Satyagraha is a very important turn in the freedom struggle.
I participate in the beginning of a modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
Through this others also write three-four words while expressing your feelings along with those photographs .
During the coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context I want to participate with you an interesting thing .
Venice Beennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time, there was an interesting exhibition with Gandhi Memorial at Venice Biennale's Indian Building.
In this Haripura Panels is specially interesting .
You will remember the historical incidents of Kangras Festival in Haripura of Gujarat , in which Subhash Chandra Bose is the student of the history .
This art panel has a beautiful past.
In 1937-38, before the Haripura meeting of Kangras, Mahatma Gandhi invited Principal Nandalal Bose, the contemporary of Shantiniketan Kala Bhavan.
Gandhiji expressed his appreciation to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through the medium of art and exhibition of their artwork.
The art work giving the beauty of our state is this Nandal Bose .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the art gallery of this Bose the art gallery of the art gallery of the art gallery of the art gallery .
Nandal Bose Haripura has been built by touring the villages near Haripura , finally by showing the life of rural India .
This precious art prize was discussed in Venice.
On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I want a resolution from every Hindustani.
Do something for the country , society , others .
At the same time, Bapu's right, real artificial work will be done.
This time it starts from 11 September .
During this time we came out of our homes and dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi with hard work.
House , streets , streets , but the streets , but art gallery but clean parks should be run in all the public places .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
On August 155 the people of hundred and a half crore countries talked with enthusiasm , energy , how did I say that in Bahraang places the work of getting rid of excretion from excretion .
Likewise, let us all stop the fun of single use plastic.
All sections of the society are enthusiastic about this publicity.
Through this money remains, it plays a part of its role in environmental protection.
This time, in the context of the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Babaji, we will dedicate the India released from the urine of Bahraang, not only to them, but also to lay the foundation stone for the mass movement against plastic.
I am making an apple with all the classes of the society , every village , every city residents .
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to make India free from plastic garbage .
All the municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , all the institutions , everybody , everybody has heard that plastic was done properly .
I urge all the corporate sectors to examine how to make a disposal organisation.
It can be recycled .
It can be used in fuel .
Today I want to tell a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of glory for food in our culture .
As much we also met food in science .
Poshan Abhiyan is becoming a mass movement in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once a thing came in my sight .
In Nasik there was a big garden of fatty cereals.
In it in the days of harvest , angan harvest services of angan harvest are collected from people .
This grain is used to make women , children hot food .
In this the person donating in it becomes a society service .
This culture is celebrated during feeding the children for the first time .
Not liquid food .
Gujarat had a thought in 2010 that why should not it be necessary to give complementary food to the children by giving complementary food to the children.
This is very important ahead , it can be participated everybody .
People in many states eat food .
A unique view of service , joyful feelings is spectacular .
Our country can be influenced by fighting with malnutrition by many such small methods .
Nowadays the right information , poor , rich people are also becoming a victim of malnutrition .
The whole country is celebrated in the form of Poshan Abhiyan in September.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was sure that there would be a lot of questions about this thing.
For the past few weeks, wherever I went, I met with my people, there was a proposal about Man Vs Wild.
Since then I have not imagined that the chance of touching the youth hearts of the world has come in my life .
But what happened .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have the opportunity to visit, I am talking to me about Yoga for five-ten minutes after the International Yoga Day.
Those who do not discuss yoga with me on the big ground of the world , I am telling about the whole world .
Discovery Channel has planned to publish this program in their language in 165 countries .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate juice , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some people are asking me a word while hesitating me, Modiji, tell me that you are talking in Hindi, Bear Gryls do not Hindi.
After this do the cost of cost .
Then what happened to be done again .
There is a question of very curiosity .
Look, there is no secret in it.
Many people have this question in mind . Okay , I tell this secret now .
Actually this is not secret .
In fact, technology has been fully used in a conversation with Bear Gryls.
As soon as I say that it was done in English , because of the convenience of convenience, Bear Gryls kept a small card lease in the ears.
Therefore, if I talk in Hindi then it was the miracle of technology that was the miracle of listening to him in English.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
You must also go to the places of nature , wildlife , living .
What is the nature
You will stay watching .
Your interior will also be large .
On 15th August I have heard you from Ekkot . At least 15 places in the coming three places , 15 places in India are completely tourist centres .
You go, see, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought will be large .
My beloved countrymen , environment protection in India i . . conservation i . . conservation is naturally visible .
In the last month I had a luck of releasing the population of tiger in the country .
You know how many tigers in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred and seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the shopping .
In 2010, a tiger meeting was held in St. Peters Burg, Russia.
In which the number of tigers has been taken information about reducing the number of tigers .
2022 calculation has to double the number of tigers in the world .
But now this is a new India . We complete the goals quickly .
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of wildlife sanctuary , community reserves has increased .
I also recognized the Gir Singh of Gujarat while releasing the tiger data.
When I responsible for the main responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number has decreased .
We took several churches together in Gir.
In 2007 we decided to make women guards there .
We shall shine the infrastructure to enhance tourists.
When we talk about natural , wild animals then the preservation of preservation is done .
But along with protection one should think about taking this church towards compassion .
Therefore we should not only save forests , trees , wild animals but also give appropriate environment to increase in the right way .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget the historical teaching of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 29th August we will celebrate the National Sports Day.
In this context, we will start the Fit India Movement across the country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit.
It is said that all their descriptions are now .
Watch 29 August .
Not only this 02 October is the entire plastic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic we should stay along with all the houses , households at all places .
I know that in the social media about this matter the dust of dust is increasing .
Come , let us move ahead with a new desire , new culture , new energy .
I'm waiting for your words, your suggestions.
Let us all come forward to realise the dreams of the freedom fighters and to realise the dreams of Gandhiji.
Mann Ki Baat - word in mind .

There is a test of each other 's children in the house , that test is done on everyone in the house .
This is the right time to speak with students , their teachers , to speak with their teachers , because I went to somewhere , these tests were seen to be a big problem .
The family, the students and the teachers are all complicated and a big psychological atmosphere is seen in every household.
Seeing them I want to participate the thought that came in my mind .
I got a message of telephone from creation.
Listen to you , what creation is said to you , what I want to say to you , during tests there is a terrible environment in our house , in our society .
Because of this reason students become unsuccessful .
The joyful people are beneficial . those who think stress is afflicted .
Therefore my goal is like a festival that my goal is considered to be festivals .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best time comes out in us .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Whatever is the best .
Festival removes the test of the environment .
That is why I told all the parents that you change all these three-four months into a zealous environment .
The truth is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir , from Kachh to Kamrup Varuku , from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh these three-four months tests are done .
That's why I call you Smile Mor, Score Mor with all of you.
If you are stressed then all the doors are closed . Outside the matter does not go inside , it does not come out .
Nobody has said that you do not have any cost .
Inside why came to remember that you came out of pressure .
Therefore , the important medicine to increase memory is that it is relaxed .
Through my swimming experience I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things but when there is a relax then how much work we remember .
Therefore, 'A Happy Mind' is the secret for a good mark-sheet.'
Sometimes it seems that we can not see the test from the right point of view .
It is not a life test .
How you live , how you live , how you want to live , it is not tested for food .
Apart from the tests given by mouth book in class room many more tests are faced in your life therefore , tests are related to the glimpse of life .
J.
The important example of Abdul Kalana is in front of all of us .
He had reached the airways .
They are not found .
Somebody sent me a question of joyful joy . In this time the biggest challenge of seeing education is that education centres have become centres .
Therefore I want to know your thoughts about the present direction of education , its future .
There is a question in their question . But Rucha Garu also wanted to know my opinion .
Tell you , do you have a family doctor to show your family
You will see his experience , knowledge , how useful he is .
Rucha Garu also called Pratisparth.
This is a big psychological war.
The speciality of the life of many good sports is that they competition with themselves .
It is a marvellous life journey to move ahead by shipping his record for twenty years .
Because he enjoyed the path of perspective Kanna .
Friends, Can you do the time of reading peacefully two hours before going to test every field of life
Before this the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
Before this the cost of test is not able to sleep for pressure , now it is not able to fall .
It produces that energy inside itself .
If you want to say simplely , if you are competitioning with anyone then three important objects will be seen . That is , first - you were known more than those before .
And he came , saying , My mother has not read much .
But sitting with me asked me to Lakh .
Accept it .
Use how much capacity you are in your work , cataract time .
If you learn to accept once , the main problems will end there .
There is a belief of conservation , studies in the roots of the problem .
Many years ago - we were in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of India Ganesh Dada Mavankar , his son , once M . . Purushottam Mavankar came to see in the hospital .
If we want to say that when we meet the person with unhealthy disease then we fear him with the name of disease .
I am told by the guards that sometimes we also act like this with the children .
If you want to make the situation of laughing for the children in the days of test then you feel that you are able to make the situation of laughing simple .
Doing this , the weather changes .
I got a picture phone call.
And he spake not his name .
Why does he not hearken to the thing , why do he not tell the name
Therefore I started trying a lot .
I tried to discover its methods so that my time has become very old .
As long as I tried to see the burrow , how much time I had to read that time I had to read properly , that way the way was gained .
Seeing how you see that it will swallow you towards the path of failing life .
If you are taken in tests then your life will be destroyed .
If you don't get caught, I do this throughout my life, not only does the crime stand in your mind.
If you have to tell your children then you can not talk properly in their eyes .
If you are also turning your roads into the dock then I have seen that some people use so much talent in looking for new methods to see that they spend so much money and spend their entire creativity for the methods.
That is the same creativeness , at the same time it is not necessary to see the matters of test .
What results are available with their own difficulty , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is unique .
What prime minister is the cost of your guru , your parents anger me .
Because students think that on paying attention to sports sports the meditation of reading decreases .
Definitely think of Asli .
The rest of the parts of the body is also important .
Give brake at least five minutes .
You know that your work is easy .
Everybody likes it or not but it is my experience .
In such a time taking deep breath is very beneficial .
There is no room to take deep breath .
Going to Mungko , Daba for five minutes while breathing deeply sit again to read .
Some people start reading more at night but definitely give sleep to the body as much as possible .
Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
The capacity of your entire capacity increases properly .
When I participate in so many councils , sometimes my throat crys .
Once a folk song came to meet me .
If you sleep properly then you will get a lot of rest for your voice .
I slept my sleep, my Prayag Gunchi, my throat never thought.
Okay , young friends , you are trying to test , I kept you in ' mind ' .
I think my house will definitely give you rest .
The security of the vagabond is the magnificence of the vagabond .

In the form of multiple contribution of Christmas Festival the people of the country get benefit from two ways .
If you want to say in a way , two new methods start .
Everyone wants to learn, learn from each other.
To encourage this thing, to strengthen mobile banking, to make e-payment habits, the Government of India has started a 'promotional mechanism' for consumers and small traders.
In order to encourage shopkeepers , 'Lucky Grahak Pathy' and to encourage businessmen 'Digi Dhan Business Pathy' are starting.
These are available in the dragon method of fifteen thousand people besides 25 December 25 Christmas .
This fifteen thousand people go to the prize of a thousand rupees everybody in Khata .
After three months on April 14th honey Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar 's birth anniversary is a bumper drain .
The ' jewellery business ' is especially a trade of traders .
Tradeers themselves can also mix shopping in it to change their business in this way .
Many people can be surprised , but today there are 30 crore cards in India , in which 20 crore poor families , Jan-dhan Khatas have these rope cards .
Immediately 30 crore people can become a part of this multiple plan .
I am very happy to see how to use technology in my country , how to use technology in the country , how to do necessity , how to do necessity , necessity , etc .
In the past few days, cashless trade, moneyless trade has increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage it .
How big businessmen can be estimated very straight .
Those traders who celebrate digital lavadevis, who promote online payment system instead of money in their business, such traders have been given income tax.
For this, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrabab Naidu has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of various strategies.
But the rest of the governments also started many methods in their way , I also saw to implement .
Anyone said that the Government of Assam will take a decision to give 10 interest to the persons who have distributed asset tax and business licenses as digital.
If the branches of rural banks are made by their 75 percent users from January 2017 to March, at least 2 digital ladies, they have received Rs. 50,000 prizes from the government.
The funny thing is that the sale of GNFC fertilizers increased by 27 percent as compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters , in our economic system , in our life system an accident is very big .

But now the ruins of the river are being done .
Money is directly deposited in the bank.
People of my beloved country , I want to give people their advice through words every month , I want to tell their opinions .
That is why in the advice coming in thousands of numbers of MyGov and Nrandra Modi Yap 80,90 percent advice has come to fight against black money .
Besides this the third part of the third part they said that they were not only told their Madhuban , along with that they also wanted to move ahead .
They are not completely destroyed water , black money , for that even more difficult steps have to be taken back , how strong it is written .

We are facing many problems all over , but we are fighting against water . We are happy to bear all this fight .
It is said that opposite to black money , water etc . we are working like the soldiers of all the soldiers .
But when there is so much difficulty , when there is so much difficulty , then there is no person suffering from such problems .
I also have the same pain as you are suffering .
But for an excellent meditation , to conduct a high thought , clean work is being done , these difficulties , sadness , pains also the people of the country stand with courage .
These people are true changes .
People are the forms of God . their blessing is the blessing of God .
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great sacrifice on water and black money with full enthusiasm.

If I decided to fight with such powers , then they also constantly find new solutions to ship the government .
If we choose such new solutions then we also have to put proper solutions to face them .
I want to tell the heartful greetings of the people of my country in one thing .
Do not tell that secret .
The secret is that the descriptions of Naka are coming from the people .
The more information is available by the government system, the more information is available from the common people than that.
This victory available to us is possible because of being absolutely unsuccessful people .

Therefore more victory is available by the information coming .
Government has been built to fight with all such misconceptions .
If it is your support then fighting is very easy .

Beloved people of my country , Christianly I have also said in my mind that even during these difficulties our rails have done a lot of difficulty , descending down the fruit and descending down the record .
From the point of view of agriculture this is a good sign .
This country is cooling , this country is the youth of this country , all these are creating new lapses .

The small shops in the villages like big malls can also do business for 24 hours, and we have taken an important decision to stop the law in the lower budget, because, according to my belief, when big malls do business for 24 hours, why should not the smaller poor shopkeepers of the villages get the same opportunity

It is my belief that Abdul Kalana is a true devotion to offer us .
To give help to the afflicted with the central governments of the state governments the shoulder shoulder shoulder to support the afflicted with the state government is troubled without power .
How much ruins , races are running that once we do not even think about us .
Not working for those patients , fighting with disease , making new methods , scientific researches , scientific researches , so that these diseases are not able to do the work of those patients .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious about the disease .

A few days ago I remembered one example of the girls of Pune .
It touched my mind .
In Pune of Maharashtra the Ratu of Khandu Maruti in Narayanpur village has done a very sufficient marriage of Sonal .
The pill has done that how much of the marriage of Sonal is that friends , friends , guests have come to all those who have given the gift of mango plant .
I wondered when I saw that picture in social media .
There is no swimming of lips in marriage .
This view of heart hungry is in that painting .
Sonal agricultural scientific scientific scientific science has come to itself .
Many people use such use .
I remember that when I was the chief minister of Gujarat then in the Ambaji temple there travellers used to come in large numbers in the month of Bhadrapa .
It is said that by giving a plant to the visitors of the temples this plant is the Prasad of mothers and mothers . If you take it carefully and put it in your house then you will be able to see the blessings of mothers and mothers .
Although lakhs of people had sent hundreds of plants to the travellers coming on foot .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of Prasad in this year .
This day, to make houses in our country, to make houses, to make houses, crores of rupees have to be imported from abroad.
If we plant trees on the rooms then the trees giving mixture to the house , furniture to the house , then after 15 - 20 years the government can sell them with the permission of the government .
The central government has also stopped the complication of complication under this chatti that more than 40 thousand crore rupees are provided to the state government for planting plants .
I know that the Government of Maharashtra has started a proposal of two crore old plants on the 1th honeymoon of July , the government has started a proposal of three crore plants .

It is not a common thing to plant old lacs of trees in Rajasthan .
The situation of Rajasthan is understood by the people who know that how big it is .

This work has been done by the Railways under the Green India Mission run by the Central Government.

But South African tourism is like a pilgrimage for me .
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela as soon as the head of South African .
On hearing the sounds of non-violence , love , peace , ears of Gandhi , Mandela their faces appear in front of our eyes .
I went to the Phinex Centre in the context of my South Africa tourism and the place where Mahatma Gandhi lived is famous with the name of Sarvodaya.
The most friends of Nelson Mandela , Shri Ahmad Kathrada , Srilalu Chiba , Shriraj Bijos , Shrironi Casarils have got the opportunity to visit all these Mahabhavans .

Rakshabandhan festival is a special festival with us .
Like Christian this seventh year also you can not give the prime minister of the mothers of our country , security Bima Yojana or life Jyoti Bima Yojana .

Like Deepavali you should also do something good with the spirit of patriotism .
As much as you can feel that you can hear these thoughts from the Red Fort .

The heat of summer is increasing daily .
In such a situation the ruins of ruins probably increased the dream of coming late for one week .
Approximately all the country has been stuck in the effect of strong sunlight .
Temperature is increasing rapidly .
Animals, birds, or humans.
Every animal is feeling pain .
Due to the reason of tourism these problems become poisonous .

This time, the United States Committee has envisaged the theme of ero Tolerance for Integral Wildlife Trade for the World Tourism Day.
In accordance with the tradition of the present government, I can hold a joint meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the unwanted States, but I do not want to do so.
I was released from every state, I spent about two and a half hours for each state.
I look forward to what every state has said.
Usually, such discussions have been approved by the Central Government as States and not beyond the amount of money spent by every State.
It was surprising that some States have made commendable efforts to deal with water, environment, ill-affected animals, and to take care of the suffering human beings.
I asked them to exercise the best practices of NITI Aayog in all the states.
Some states, especially Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilized technology.
I would like to share the extremely successful efforts of these states by NITI Aayog to other states in the future.
Peoples participation is a strong foundation for addressing such issues.
We pray for God's forgiveness five times along with crying with it.
Water is also a goddess .
Therefore, water accumulation, water storage and sustainable use of sanitation water will also be given equal priority.
By adapting the microscope system, it is necessary to implement more crops than every drop of water by cultivating affordable water consumption crops.

Water-Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh
Chhattisgarh has launched the Lok Suraj-Jal Suraj campaign.
Efforts are being made to recognise them as water deities in the oldest regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
Pradhan Mantri Jal-Swavalamban Yojana has been launched in Rajasthan.
Although Jharkhand is the forest area, there is water in some places.
This is a matter of concern for the villagers, the poor, the sick, the labourers, the farmers, the dwellers and the villagers.
It is a matter of joy that this time when Deepavali is celebrated, how much water can be hidden and how much water can be stopped from getting older.
Then we don't have the bounds of joy.
Water is so powerful that we are so tired and so tired that we have poured so much water on our face and we will become fresh.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, when I saw a big pond.
We cannot save the wealth by keeping a cosmetic mind.
We will increase the water resources.
Increase water .
We bring the water back into use .
I am pressing this thing to you.
Do not leave the coming time old.
We will transform the Jal Bachao Abhiyan to save the drops of water for four months.
It's not the mantra, it's ours.
It is our best responsibility that the media and the media have explained in detail about the water flow in the past.
The media also wishes to guide people in the matter of water conservation, plantations and water consumption.
I also welcome those media.
We have to change our old habits.
I am confident that if you help me in this regard, we will be able to achieve our development in that direction.
There was no coins or no mouths.
If you want salt , vegetables .
The world is moving towards a cashless system.
We can take and give it through electronic technology.
There will be no fear of pursuing pockets.
Automatic numbers are there.
Initially it will be difficult.
But gradually it becomes a habit and this system becomes easier.
With the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, we have opened accounts in almost all the families of the country.
In the coming days, the Credit and Debit work in two ways.
There is no need to take out the pocket and calculate.
I don't want to betray the dubb.
The second work we launched will transform the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions-UPI policy.
It will be easier to get a mini transmission through mobile phones.

Nearly 1.
25 lakh banking companions are being provided to youngsters.
But as soon as it happens, it will be better.
How's the dinner
When the sportsperson knows that 125 crore people are with him, this enthusiasm will be doubled.
If we don't have the desired results, life will not stop there.
Spirit should live with faith and move forward with self-confidence.
But a new question has come to me and I have never thought of it.
My favour.
When I came to an e-mail in the site, my vision went there.
He put his time before me, Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh.
It looks a burden on my mind and he sent it.
Earlier, you used to want to achieve even more development.
I want all of you to believe that when your child brings the results to the house, actually confess them, pleasure and pleasure.
Encourage them to achieve further development, or else, they have brought hundreds and hundreds.
If anything else is done then it will be better that day too.
Those around me don't recognize our conditions.
These lines are not remembered properly .
But the poet has written that I have painted my pains on the egg that puts the images of life.
On seeing the picture in the exhibition, they suggested that it would have been better if it was blue instead of blue color, it would have been better if the songs were stuck without brick.
There is no understanding of the painting, but most of the people who say that the painting is to be done.
However, if you are not happy to see the results, you can never build new constructions.
Sadhana is a pleasure and helps to achieve further.
It continues to face in life.
You must have heard of Sansoor's promise.
Sometimes it was used only in folk songs in Kashmir Valley.
Cleaning is the biggest weapon to prevent diseases.
Cleanliness only benefits the poor.
The second weapon is that I say yoga every time.
It is called yoga .
June 21 is International Yoga Day.
Yoga provides the power to live ease of living in this world full of problems.
Yoga Day on 21st June is not a programme.
We must inspire us to change our lives.
Each time, the community climate will bring about changes in the lives of man.
Let's see, on June 21, you will be a participant.
Can we not use June 21 to make Yoga a part of our lives
This time I will be going to the programme to be held in Chandigarh.
On 21st June, I will meet the residents of Chandigarh to perform Yoga.

Now summer season .
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
This is also the time of mango fruits and we want to taste these fruits.
We feel better if we take a little at noon once in the afternoon .
But this year sunshine has destroyed everyone 's entertainment .
How natural is it that the species were stopped about the heat of the heat .
Since last two years , due to the irregularity of irregularity of irregularity , there has been adverse effect on the places of water standing .
Sometimes due to sewage, sometimes due to sand scorpions, water flow in reservoirs and other water resources has been blocked.
As a result , reservoirs can keep water only less than their capacity .
Governments are trying to solve the problem of famine , to provide relief from water conservation .
But this is not only one .
Citizens are blessed with commendable work to meet the situation.
In many villages, now there is a consciousness.
Those who experience the deficiency of water can know the price of water .
In the Hive Rebazar village Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra, the villagers considered the deficiency of water as a major and soft problem.
Somebody can see the villages expressed by the hunger of water .
In the Hiw Rebazar, the farmers resolved the problem by changing the sowing practice of crops.
That is, they have decided to abolish the harvesting of prison and banana.
It's very easy to hear, but in reality it's not easy.
How big is this decision
The masters of the workers who have more water have to say about the use of such water to the workers that their units have to be closed then how can anybody imagine the responsibilities coming .
But see the scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science of this rail brother .
He said that the prisoner has to bear water to harvest, so he said that he should not harvest the crop.
Besides , how much less water is being used like fruits , vegetables .
They followed various programmes such as sprinklers, drop winds, water housing, water recharge, etc.
I can tell you about a small town like Hive Rebazar, but there would be a lot of such villages.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of such villages for their good work.
I have said, Gorwa Gram Panchayat is in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
Nearly 27 crop ponds have been constructed.
Approximately 20 of their agricultural production has increased.
When the level of water comes up, the quantity of water also changes.
Clean drinking water is also a cause of GDP growth.
But how many of our surroundings are trying to meet the unnecessary requirements, how new methods are being formulated for the solution.
This time, why should we not take the soil from the pond to the field
Farming is also very good and the power to accumulate water in the field also increases.
Sometimes in the cement bags, sometimes in the empty bags of fertilizers, stones, soil filling them in the empty bags of fertilizers and stopping them in the way of water getting older.
Shri Kumar Krishna, who wrote in MyGov, also expressed a kind of curiosity
We can never succeed in this work without public participation.
Therefore, everybody has to become a messenger for cleanliness and transformation for cleanliness.
This thing should be repeated and discussed again.
In this, we are also playing a role in social institutions and hygiene institutions.
We are taking several steps to prevent further cleanliness and industrial pollution.
Every day, a large number of sewages reach the river Ganga through calves.
In order to clean such waste, the work of cleaning waste is being done at top places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
All local institutions have been required to explore and clean the wastage at places.
Wherever the cleanliness programme is going on, the waste is supplied from 3 to 11 tons per day.
Pollution from paper work has also stopped almost.
It is known that we all are moving forward in the right direction and awakening.
Not only residing on the banks of the river Ganga.
It is rare to have such programmes in these villages of the country within 10 days.
This is an occasion for the well-being of the village, for the development of the village and for the nurturing of democracy.
Whatever consciousness has come in the villages.
Therefore, if we all strengthen the progress of the village then we will get the expected results.

They are doing a lot in their methods.
But if we unite our various systems in the community sector and work together, we can see the greatest results.
It provides inspiration and a national vision increases.
I have got this benefit in childhood.
I also want a new life in these institutions.
This time I kept something in front of them.
How many Blacks and how many districts we have been able to defecate.
These are, I'm listening to you all.

Crores of rupees were spent on these committees.
But the matter was where it was.
This is of everybody's experience.
Nobody thinks about it .
Today, my beloved country residents, I am very happy to keep my own poison in this matter in front of you.
One crore families have cleaned their gas subsidy.
This fort is not a rich family.
It is also easy to leave the subsidy on top.
You can yp on mobile phones.
The subsidies can be released online by giving Missed Call to Number 1982.
I salute those crore families for centuries.
This is one thing which is different from our country's economicists.
We must move forward in this direction.
I would like to say that why to intervene in class II and class VIII employees.
Sometimes I feel like one more, we have to say that in some ways there will be no one who has made a ticket in the train journey.
Once we do this, we will have unprecedented results.
Okay, these are my thoughts, which cannot be converted into government rules.
However, such people can create an atmosphere that is possible.
Please ask your officers to post on some or the other good event every day.
Breaking News is in every newspaper or TV channel.

Even though the Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual festival, we must consider it as a social context.
On the important occasion of Panchayati Raj Diwas, I will definitely be meeting with you all this evening.
This is my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Like whenever, the bond between your thoughts and thoughts in my mind gives me immense pleasure.
Man Ki Baat , July 2019 .
As Mann Ki Baat, I and you are also waiting for it.
A large number of people shared the details of various books.
People are discussing books written on various subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and life history.
He also advised me to talk about some more books.
However, I will talk to you about the books without any time.
But I assume that time cannot be spent to read more books.
But there is a benefit that if you see the details you write and send, I need to know the details of a lot of books.
It seems that we need to take it forward by the experience of this month.
Why should we not put a sustainable book corner in this Narendra Modi App to read, write and discuss new books
You don't give us a good name to this book corner.
We will make it an active platform for readers and writers.
You keep reading, writing, and everybody of Mann Ki Baat shared with colleagues.
I would like to extend my best wishes to the people of the state for their discussions with the farmers and for their traditional farming policies and for encouraging affordable water requirements.

We can see that a sportsperson is a champion after winning a tournament.
However, in this rare event, all these champions were not participating in the sports competition.

Today, through the Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share details of a competitive competition with students friends and young colleagues of the country.
I invite youngsters in the country - a quiz competition.
The key feature of this uiz Competition is the curiosity of space, Indias space mission, science and technology.
I wish that young colleagues and students will participate in this quiz competition and convert it into an unforgettable and unforgettable transformation.
I specially urge the schools, enthusiastic teachers, teachers and guardians to make every effort to achieve success for their schools.

This victory will be a historic event for the victorious students.
But don't forget to participate in the uiz.
We inspire more and more people to participate.
My dear countrymen, you must have done one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has moved ahead when we asked for all the Swachhta missions.
All the favourite efforts for cleanliness are inspired by the Mann Ki Baat.
Starting five years ago, this journey is reaching new miles of hygiene in collaboration with all the people.
We cannot reach the ideal position in Swachhta, just like this, the success of 130 crore Indians from ODF to Swachhta Abhiyan in public places is a pledge.
But we'll stop here.
This initiative will enhance sanitation to beautification.
In the meanwhile, a few days ago, Shri Yogesh Saini, his group and his stories were seen in the media.
Yogesh Saini, an engineer, left his job in America and returned to the service of Mother India.
They have not only made Delhi clean but also made efforts to beautify Delhi in a short span of time.
He also worked with his team, from the ruins of Lothy Garden.
The work of decorating many places in Delhi through beautiful paintings has been done through the Street Art.
Over Bridge and slum dwellings from the sides of walls to slum can also be used for people's support, not only for their art, but also for the first time.
You will remember how Prayagraj has been decorated with street paintings in Kumbh.
We also experience this thing in the beauty of the Swachhta Mission.
Mohammad Aslam Bhai in Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I will play an active role in organising a Community Mobilisation Programme - Back to Village in our Jammu and Kashmir State.
Besides, there should be an online monitoring mechanism on this programme.
In about four and a half thousand Panchayats in the state, government officials have given detailed details of government schemes and programmes to the villagers whether all these government services are reaching them or not
How to increase the capacity of Panchayats
How can they increase their income

The people of Kashmir participated in this festival of development.
In this season, we saw the surroundings as if the earth was covered with green dress.
During this time, Raksha Bandhan festival will also be a reflection of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be glad to hear another thing when the month of Shravan, more than four years of devotees have gone under the Amarnath Yatra this time.
More than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the pious Amarnath cave from 1st July till date.
The number of people participating in this journey in 60 days in 2015 is more than 28 days.
In the context of the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I will especially praise the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
I am told that in Uttarakhand this time, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within a month from the beginning of the Chardham Yatra.
For the first time after the terrible disaster in 2013, such record number of pilgrims reached the venue.
My request to all of you is that you should not go to those places which are beautiful in the country during the years of age.
To see this beauty in our country, there will be no greater teachers than this in tourism journey to know the spirit of the people of our country.
On the other hand, there is a time of heavy rains in many places of the country.
Today the Christians of the world are celebrating this festival .
This is my ruins for everybody .
My young friends .
On one hand tests . on the other hand T20 cricket is the world camp match .
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match .
Below a few days Pakistan , Bangladesh has spent India in two matches with water .
We are looking at this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today India , Australia is ready to play the water of Australia , these are my best wishes for both these waters .
In our country 65 percent youth in the population of our country we do not see any reason to stay away from participating in the world .
This is not the work of happening .
We need to bring revolutionary changes in sports.
We can see this place in the country of India .
Like cricket now there is an interest in football , hockey , tennis , cabbage .
You will know that India will be hosted in the coming year to FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
Our country has come to play twenty four water from all over the world .
In 1951 , in 1962 Indian football had spent golden medals in Asian Games . In 1956 the hair of India was standing at the fourth place .
For some decades of the past of itching we slipped from there to places .
I do not even want to say about our rankings in FIFA today.
On the other hand, I am enjoying the interest of football in the youth of India as much as I am enjoying that it does not allow English premier Leg or Leg , or allow Indian Super Leg match .
Indian youngsters are taking time to know the fresh information about these matches, to see them in TV.
I want to say that when this sports increases so much that when we get the opportunity to give the guests to the World Cup of AIDS then we will not only fulfil our responsibility to fulfil our responsibility .
Or do we encourage sports using this opportunity to benefit us
The meaning of football , football , football , football all this year we should create the atmosphere of changing this year - in schools , art galleries , that is the corner of India .
Our children should be wet with sweat while playing football in our youth , buses .
It has been done that for giving guests we get the joy of synonym .
Therefore we try to take the beauty of football to the village , streets .
From now on, FIFA under-17 World Cup in 2017 will fill up a kind of zeal in youth.
It is better to give guests to this program that many basic sports are being done here .
When we can make every young man of our country with this sports .
How can we increase the interest in the youth of India in this sports by the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017
How can the comparison of competition in the government , educational institutions , social institutions
We are watching this place in cricket
We should also try to present these parlors to other sports departments .
I think this is a chance to identify the young powers of India to the world - not in the sense of any match or Odama.
2017 FIFA under-17 World Cup, we can exhibit the capabilities of our energy.
Similarly, we can also take a branding that enhances Indias prestige.
You can send me your suggestions and suggestions related to the 2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup through the NarendraModiApp
How should the songs be
What should be there in Sawanier .
Think friends .
Every young man should be the messenger of FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017.
You should participate in this program .
This is a golden space for making India a prestigious.
You will think of going somewhere in my beloved students , holidays .
There are very few people going to foreign countries .
We should take this work even more ahead .
This time also do this work .
And the journey without discovering said , Who is like a bird without wings
If you are really interested to see , you should also prepare the international attention to see them .
Travelling in proper life plays a strong role .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing in the youth of India .
In the first days they do not go on the way to everybody , on the way to go .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the guests there , then how will we go there
But this coal has shown the status of Western Coal Filds Limited for tourism .
Near the Sawaner village near Nagpur the Eco French Main Tourism site has been sold on 10,000 people till now .
If you want to see something new then this gives us a chance .
This time when you go to roam in the holidays then you can also do anything for cleanliness .
In scientific method this attempt is not done but work is done .
But if we want to make the tourism of 125 crore people of the country , then we can attract the world .
We can do a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise our crores can show the opportunity of the youth .
Government , institutions , society , society , people worked to conduct it .
Come on, in this direction we will make an attempt.
Beloved my young friends , holidays like this I do not like to make a little vain in the city .

If the cycle does not come then the decision can be taken to learn cycle in holidays .

There are many types of experts for the development of our personality .
Why should not they learn

You look around yourself.
You must use your holidays to develop your personality , to enhance your personality , to shine your efficiency .

Look at once . What is the thing that you are working in it .
There is some deficiency in it , there is less information i . . you can make me a complaint .
Ratu waits for rains .
But if there is no water then all our countrymen should also think about what happens .
During this time we stop water flowing in our ponds , places of water flowing in our place , water reaching in the ponds , due to the construction of waste , or ill effects there the water flowing there is reduction in order .
In the past we can prepare the cost of water at places , places , places after cleaning the waste after cleaning the water and reaching the water even more .
Filling up the ponds , our rivers , canals filled that after that the deficiency of water does not hurt us much .
But if we keep on holding the lap of every single water then it is possible .
This time we were contacted to excavate five lakh water ponds .
Although now how much effort is necessary in this direction .
Beloved my brother , brothers , sisters . Italy Government of India has organised a heavy railing .
Everything should be balanced .
That is why expensive expensive expensive money remains .
And our remedy said, "Marching down, more and less, more crops".
This very mantra should be done , we should develop in our agricultural ways .
This year the festival is organised throughout the world with the name of ' Beta Diabetes ' .
It is estimated that approximately six and a half crore people of our country are diabetes patients .
Three percent deaths have become the cause of diabetes .
Two types of types of diabetes are Type . . .
Type . is hereditary .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes.
Physical labor decreases .
Sweat does not take it .
We can do anything in our personal life to smite diabetes from the 7th honey of April .
If you are yoga meaning zeal then do yoga .
Or do at least walk or race procedure .
If everybody is healthy in this India then my country is also healthy .
March 24th day is celebrated on the day of the treatment of tuberculosis .
I know that when I heard the name of TV then they were afraid .
It seemed as if death had fallen near .
But now there is no fear of tuberculosis because now everyone knows that the treatment of tuberculosis is possible .
Tuberculosis is such a disease i . . nearby people , twenty neighbours also recognize .
There are 13 thousand 500 centres of microscope centres in our country . four lakh dot services are available .
This test is also done free .
You should test once.
This disease stops .
It is necessary to get the right treatment , to get the treatment done till the disease is completely cured .
There are some important contributions in the month of April . specially on 14 April Baba Saheb Bhimb Ambedkar Jayanti .
He was the whole year of 125th Jayanti .
His birthplace in Mahao, his education in London, his Diksha in Nagpur, his house in Delhi, 26 in Alipur Road, his last works were done in the Chaityabhumi.
We are constantly trying to develop in these Panchtirthas .
I am fortunate to visit his healthy Mahav on April 14 this year.
Baba Saheb has inspired us to change an excellent Pauri .
Through changing a good Pauri on his way we can pay tribute to him in a honourable way .
In some days the new year of Vikram Sanctuary starts .
It is celebrated in different states in different forms .
You can hear in your mobile phone .
For this only one missed call has to be done.
This service started only for months but 35 lakh people used it .
You also come to number.
Together with you this is how happy I am .
I want to know from you how much we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 for our benefits.
How should this program be done
The AIDS program gives a special opportunity to do this .
They have done photographs of such grand places that seeing them really enjoys how much .
I consider it a good signal .
Whereever there is no knee , like to bear feet there .
This contribution is considered to be a special impression of India .
In comparison to the countries of the world India is far behind in the tourism sector .
You also think like this .
I'll tell you a thing to think.
Look - you will be happy .
I am impressing you to say this thing again in Mann Ki Baat.
If you want to tell the truth , I forgot its identity .
How enjoyed you to see this thing .
For the conservation of water we should take those churches with complete care .
The guests of many other diseases in our body enter the house of our body .
You must think of this thing.
It is said that tuberculosis has come to the test of Babu .
It is said that T . . . came to him .
It means that this disease is such that it can also be tested very quickly .
But , you do not think that this work is not because of government , doctors , medicines , therefore the people of the country are my information .
Therefore , in your mind also the same glimpse remains .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
As much as you are in the matter of your child tests , I have the same obstacle .
But if we change our thoughts about tests , perhaps we will be free from this obstacle .
I have said in the Mann Ki Baat so much ago that your experiences and suggestions should not be sent through the NarendraModiApp.
I would like to talk to my parents, examinees and their teachers in my Mann Ki Baat today.
I know that in some days the tests start .
Everybody asks how to go , tests .
How many ways come , how much scorpion do I want to tell one .
You decide the goal for yourself.
While playing cricket I used to estimate many estimations on me , how much hoped from me .
The estimations of some estimations spending time have been named even more .
Then I needed to find out the result of this .
I decide my goals myself , can conduct them that I can do something good for the country .
I was constantly trying to conduct those goals .
Gradually the goals of central goals were fulfilled on my point of view .
Good luck.
Make your future .
It is my belief that these things are useful for you .
Why should we not keep ourselves ready
Where we reached , how far we came .
Do not get stuck in the same number .
We must decide a greater objective for life and travel with a dream.
Therefore if you choose a large , high dream then tests become a joyful festival .
In them there is a healthy mind in the healthy body itself .
If we talk about that then our daily church should be suitable for our dreams and resolutions for 365 days.
His special suggestion is that sleep regularly , waking up from sleep early in the morning , mind .
Take the entry centres , other things to the test centres reach before the determined time .
Do not do this .
I believe you don't do that.
Otherwise in life the root cause of keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
There is a strong foundation with regular education .
They do not stay comfortable , they do the work of working in the morning and they do the work of doing at noon after the time of the night .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes impossible .
Therefore we should not see everything small .
Make sure, look.
O friends .
Sometimes I saw , two types of water were seen in the students going to the tests .
This thing can be said better than me , that is , the joy of Champion Vishwanathan built by the handicrafts of the world .
He divides his experiences with you .
Come , how to make these tests sports learn by him .
Hello, I enjoyed Vishwanathan.
How did I get ready for my tests , even more my experiences will now be described .
It has been said that these tests were like problems occurring beforehand in life .
Therefore if you are calm , eat nutritious food , sleep straight , therefore your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute very important stories , you see the stories that you have not remembered properly once again .
The joy of Vishwanathan is really important .
How much healthy he sits in the international chadarang competition , how much concentration you will be able to discover .
Is Arjun standing on the eyes of the bird
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then you will find many things in water below .
Before that when there is no cost of anything then it will be seen after putting stone .
If water is washed , things steps are also seen in it .
It takes 30 , 40 , 50 seconds , but completely my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal is a good thing .
He wrote in my App: We meet at least half an hour every day with friends and family members.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
Ranchi Manas is in an effort to reach the flow of culture within the country and outside the world while extending it to the present situation.
In such a puja Murari Babu Saint had sent an important Chitka for the students .
He is also a teacher , a thinker , therefore there is a combination of both his words .
In your test if you move ahead without any stress then you will definitely be successful .
It is also pride to be successful .
I will convey my message and best wishes by saying a poet - there is no rules for everybody to be grateful
Learn to live mixed with virus also .
I believe that the Mann Ki Baat programme of our Honble Prime Minister is precious.
I am also thankful to him for giving a very good message to all of us .
It is a matter of enjoying me .
Such a jynasty has been born . It seems very good to me .
Now I say this thing that to morrow start doing yoga from the dawn - it will be unjust to you.
Very light results .
You must pay attention to it .
Look, you can do them.
Why do all these things hungry .
Read these suggestions carefully . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question is difficult .
Therefore the competition tests .
Do not lie down , work without bending your strength .
And I said unto all my young friends , This is the same .
At the same time, keep in mind that there are many opportunities in this country.
Decide what you want to do in life , never take it .
You will win.
You don't forget that this world maternal child is.
You have the right to stay here as well as through trees - mountains .
You have to be able to take care of , unconscious emotional emotions , meditation .
With these symptoms you will be excited in all the tests .
I hope to succeed in every matter you want to do .
Bless you God .
Seeing how is a great scientist talking to him
To say that I take half an hour , that thing is told in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This scientist is the strength of the mind .
I am telling thanks to the children of the country to give support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be scared.
Besides this , the future of gold is waiting for you .
Now a message from the taste dobus on my app - has shared the experience of its tests.
It is said that during the test everybody 's family members try to stay in a social environment , this kind of exercise happens in their families as well .
Sometimes there are many things like this , do not consider the words that inspire us - students only inspire .

This is the capability of moving us forward.
Therefore, it seems very easy to make Dilip Singh proud in Mann Ki Baat.
This occasion of Yoga Day has also made our country such a pleasure.
The mantra of Swachhta is changing in every household.
So far, this discussion has not been discussed in large numbers in the media.

Can we start new start-ups, innovative and diverse start-ups in our States with an excellent opportunity for our youth
The world has not moved forward without new innovations and creativity.
Start-up India - Stand-up India has brought a big opportunity to the youth.
My young friends, the Government of India will bring the Start-up India - Stand-up India to the full-level implementation system on 16th January.

That's the idea.
India is revered by the youth of neighbourhood.
On 16th January, I will come before you and speak in detail about this.
Your advice and suggestions are always welcome.

Once it is called handicaped, or called disabled - specifically an added person is called - many such things are heard.
We know that products are also important.
Why don't we use the Divyangs instead of the disabled persons in our country

Staying in schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stands, railway stations, ramps, parking, lifts, all the journals in Brailley script - creative work to facilitate all these - technologies, arrangements, arrangements - a comprehensive and collaborative approach.
They should not be dead in files and remains.
The schemes are for the common man and for the poor.
There is no way of knowing whether or not.
The government has brought some changes in this regard.
Opening of Jan Dhan Account - Aadhar card, with the help of this, the largest cash transfer scheme in the world has made subsidy directly to the beneficiaries account.

On the one hand, opening of Jan Dhan accounts on the other hand, creating a list of beneficiaries involving the third state and central governments - linking them with Aadhaar and Account.
The National Rural Employment Scheme is being implemented in the villages.

The new business activities have also been started with enthusiasm.
On the other hand, arrangements for Christmas festival are also being started.
How important is the festival in social life for us.
Once the festival is used to heal our wounds, once it gives a new strength.
In a few days in our country, how did we have an unprecedented years of dignity, premature varshas and unprecedented years.
In particular, the damage caused by these years in Tamil Nadu has also been affected by other states.
But now seeds have changed .
At every level, it is essential to work towards enhancing our capabilities.
The government, civil society, public and small and big institutions have been able to enhance their capabilities with a deep scientific perspective.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I am talking to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shri Nawaz Sharif.
He also suggested that all SAARC countries should make joint lectures to meet disasters.
I am very happy to hear your words.
But this problem is not in one Punjab or in one Haryana.
However, the feeling you have expressed today is very true.
It's not real.
Remains of crops are also very precious.
How does it work to eat animals and it will also improve our land.
There will be double the benefits of such reflections on that ground.
Once I have got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who have made a banana.
They told me about a good experience.
When the banana was cultivated, the cultivation of banana was left.
Five thousand, ten thousand and fifteen thousand rupees were spent for each hectares to facilitate such land.
My dear countrymen, on December 3, the world will celebrate the International Disability Day.
So far, I will talk to you on organ donations in Mann Ki Baat.
I also talk about the Noto Helpline for organ donation.
Organisation saves many precious lives.
The requirement brings a certain imperfection.
So far, on 3rd December, we will celebrate the Disabled Day.
Today, I would like to tell you about Javed Ahmad.
He is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, militants were killed on Javed Ahmad in Kashmir.
A little part of the stomach, intestines has gone .
The spinal cord was severely injured .
How to improve arrangements for disabled persons in external regions and government offices
He was able to buy his products in these matters.
He took a master degree in social service.
There is also some reality in it.
A few days ago, the Government of Orissa has specifically honoured a hope worker on the occasion of Independence Day.
The entire village of Janam Manisingh has been continuously working for mosquito mosquito mitigation.
In such a way there was no malaria .
My dear young friends, I have put three e-books on the MGV site for my young friends who are very active in the Internet and social media.
The e-book is one, and the health sector is related to the ideal villages of Parliament for smooth stories on one Swachh Bharat programme.
Send to the Tapaka Magov.
Bulb Bathak is one.
I once said that on the full day, all the lamps of the streets should be squeezed and watered in the moon for an hour and enjoy the full moon.
Because that Link ji is from News.
Noor Jahan of Kanpur is a woman.
On television, she doesn't seem to be better.
However, nobody thinks of her work.
The sun-charged solar power is working to provide light to the poor.
Fighting on darkness.
In the evening, people take her to Dighar Lanter.
I heard that about 500 households at a very big height would come to Digha and take lounters.
But the house is light .
However, this Noor Jahan will be engaged in the work of recharge of translators with solar power all day.
I congratulate the GST television because the work being done in Kanpur has shown the glimpse of the entire country and the whole world.
My best wishes.
I have phoned Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Uttar Pradesh.
I am talking to Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Gorakhpur.
I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister.
I have sent a message from Gorakhpur.
The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana provides funds to the illiterate.
Mudra boosts encouraging hard work.
MUDRA is an opportunity to compensate.
Mudra makes sufficient in real sense .
The Mudra Yojana is being run to make small traders evening.
We have to enjoy that speed as fast as possible.
But, the beginning has been done well.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakhs have been given Rs. 42 thousand crore from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek himself said about his enthusiasm.
My companions also have a lot of news.
I have said that there is a person like Shailesh Bhosle in 1982.
He said Swachh Abhiyan is preparing new entrepreneurs.
Shailesh Bhosle had shown it .
I have said that our Mudra Yojana is also the same.
He said about Mata Sharma in Bhopal, she has received Rs. 40,000 from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
She is working to prepare the parcels.
That is why she used to borrow a lot of loans in the past and used to do business with a lot of hard work.
Now, because of the fact that the hand is being dubbed in a large number, she is doing her work even better.
She was spent more than one of the reasons for this unfinished reason.
Today, the loan provided by the bank is getting more income of about Rs. 1000 per month.
There is a good business for their family gradually.
However, I would like to further promote this project.
They should help more and more small traders as possible.
We want to sacrifice them.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Sardar Patel's birth anniversary, I have mentioned 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
In some cases, there is a need to remain unprecedented in social life.
'Maharashtrayaan, awakening, vyana' is liberated through eternal unequality.
Internal Nigha Basin, India.
I am told that all the information is coming up.
But I hope more information will come.
I wish a clear plan.
I am told that the participants will get certificates.
Some of the major honours have also been announced.
You also use your creative power.
Life should be filled .
I am confident that your suggestions will come to work.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is beginning.
In order to keep the body healthy, how much time we can do yoga in this winter.
Therefore, we have a good habit in good weather.
Once again my best wishes to all my dear countrymen.
Jai Hind.
I salute all of you.
This Siris has been named 'Gandhi-Mandela Siris'.
Congratulations to the people because many people started participating in the Mann Ki Baat Mansoo Baat programme.
I have to talk about Kerala today.
The students of St. Mary primary schools in Kerala-Kochi and Chittor have written a letter to me.
I have sent a picture of India in the shape of India.
I was surprised to know why they made a picture in the shape of India with their fingerprints.
But after reading the script, I understand how important they want to give a symbolic message.
These girls have only consciously consciously done to the Prime Minister.
Their objective is to become a professional and professional.
These girls have written to me in a letter to me that you should enquire people on the part of your Mann Ki Baat Mansool Baat programme.
80 years old from Maharashtra, Sudke Guruji - he has always been a mission.
He said that the organs should be celebrated.
I have also received many messages on this phone.
Devsh of Delhi also sent me such a message .
However, in this country with an hundred twenty five crore people, only 5 thousand organs are successful.
Every year, there is a need for a glimpse of lakhs of eyes.
We are only reaching up to 25 thousand.
We can only give one place where four eyes are required.
Death in road accident can be donated to body organs.
There are more legal problems.
The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation-NOTO has been set up to promote organ transformation.
The 24-hour Helpline is available for 1800-114770 services.
It is said that Ten Tekteen Bhanji Tha.
The joy of sacrifice and the best description of it is in the mantra of Tekteen Bhanji Tha.
We have seen all of us on TVs recently.
Now we have celebrated the festival of the dawn and the victory.
Ganesh Chaturthi has also been done.
India is the first time in such a big way.
54 African countries and heroes from the numbers.
Outside Africa, African countries are among the largest meetings.
We will become a third of the world's population by adding these two.
Over 25,000 African students are studying in India for human resource development, capacity building.
Many of those who have studied here are now heroes in many countries in Africa.
We are well aware of this in a strong relationship.
From this point of view, this meeting is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good job.
Millions of students showcased this vision.
The people of the village have seen it.
People know how much Mahatma Gandhi played a key role in Africa-India relations and the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality in these two regions.
Thereafter, many parlor friends have performed this work.
He has worked very carefully.
In the last month, there was a workshop in Bhopal.
On the Adarsh Village Scheme, the elderly, the District Collector, the Members of Parliament and all the Union and State Governments discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana in depth.
Unfortunately, the extremists - bombs, storms and bloody land of Jharkhand come to us.
Several areas have been destroyed due to the impact of Left Wing Extremism.
The officers encouraged tourism.
I congratulate Shri Gaurav and Members of Parliament, Shri Kariyamunda.
Although the architects of Nako are from Andhra .
Ruwala, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from the North-Eastern State of Mizoram.
He did a good job in selecting Ravala Hilling village of Adarsh village in the Northeast.
Shri Rulalaji started the festival of jaggery on March 11 in this village.
Congratulations to Shri Ruwalaji, who worked towards making Adarsh village as well as Swayamsamridhi Village.
My dear brothers and sisters, How will there be no mention of cleanliness in this programme
This message has been sent from Mumbai to Savitarai through a woman editorial.
This time we will clean our homes and our traditions for Deepavali.
As a result, as soon as Deepawali became, the initiative on cleanliness started on its own.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form after the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I extend my best wishes to all the media institutions in the country.
On 2nd October last year, I got the opportunity to participate in a meeting organized on the Swachh Bharat jubilee celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Institute presented Clean India Awards.
I am proud that such people have worked for Swachh Bharat under the One Lake One Mission.
How many countries have been cleaned in our country.
All this has come to light and I heartily congratulate the India TV group, which has done so wonderfully.
He also participated in the programme with about 55,56,000 children in Andhra and Telangana States.
Overseas areas, railway stations, spiritual regions, hospitals and parks have been published on cleanliness in such areas.
Now these newspapers give us the strength that we need to achieve the goals of Swachh Bharat through these programmes.
So, all the people of the country are now taking this initiative forward, considering it as their duty.
He further said that the Cleanest Village in Asia is the most cleanest village award.
It is a pleasure to note that many villages have won many awards in the field of sanitation in the state of Meghalaya, far away from our country.
My dear countrymen, in the address made by me from the Red Fort on August 15, there are some aspects of unemployment.
When the poor goes to smaller jobs, the number of components he has made for the recommendations, the kind of complaints he asks for, the kind of jobs he gets, the jobs he gets lost, the jobs he doesn't have.
I have never heard in the world how many psychologists understand a person in an interview of one or two minutes.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all young friends.
Similarly, in the following budget, I have unveiled a flagship project.
Gold has become a part of social life in our country.
Under this you can deposit your gold in banks.
Now do not keep gold in home .
One more thing is that in the Savarin Gold Band, you will have gold dries in your hands.
But now we start it .
Because of this, there is no need to buy gold now.
The Prime Minister said that in the coming week, the country will come forward with the people of the country.
I am very happy to say that we are bringing gold coins and gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Why shouldn't our country have a indigenous seal
So, in the coming week, we will be able to access the common man before Dhan Teras, and we will start five grams and ten grams of Indian gold coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Besides, 20 grams of gold rice is also available to the people.
I assure you that this new project will bring about a new change in the direction of economic capability.
But the Ekta Mantra - must be a constant medium for our thoughts, conducting judgments and individualism.
There is a diversity in India .
Several classes, religions, traditions, many languages, different castes and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the only mantra.
Peace, harmony, unity, these are Divyushadhis for development.
Over the last several years, Run for Unity programme has been launched at many places in the country on 31st October.
Take one mantra forward.
Now you will be cleaning yourself for Deepawali and cleaning your houses.
New goods can be purchased.
The festival of Deepavali is being celebrated everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali.
But in the day of Deepawali we are listening to some things.
Therefore, I am particularly excited about my visit to Britain.
It is a matter of fact that the work done for women's empowerment for the democracy of Lord Vishwaswar has to be studied in the world several years ago.
On the grounds of London, the statue of Lord Vishwaswar is an excellent example to say, how many Indian great men think about the innovation and centuries ago.
We must learn many languages in a country like India.
I will also try myself to reach you in your language at 8 pm.
There has been a good bond between us.
The year has been completed in the last few years.
Now we are entering into a new year.
Once again, my beloved countrymen, my best wishes.
Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat Programme (THER), September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - Mansu speaks - one year, many words.
I don't know what you get from this, but I can tell you how much I have received.
How important is the power of the people in democracy.
I have a priority idea in my life and with this I am immensely grateful to the power of the people.
But in Mann Ki Baat- Mansu I have learnt through the programme, I have understood, I have received, and I have to say that we think, more and more peoples power is inadequate.
Our ancestors used to say that the people are part of the Bhagwan.
But millions of people used to consciously send advice to me.
It's a great power in itself.
These lakhs of stimulations taught me a big lesson.
The same is that the information should reach the bottom to the top level, it should actually move from the top to the bottom.
Who said this information will change in the voice of Mann Ki Baat Mansu.
But it happened.
Similarly, Mann Ki Baat- Mansu has transformed into a necessity of speaking and social power.
Keeping in mind the tourism sector in India, I have urged all the citizens to send an incredible India, brothers and sisters.
But how big adventure has emerged.
Similarly, people have sent photographs from different parts of the country.
It is a philosophy and an experience for the power of the people.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat Mansu, the poor will have light in the houses, the children will cry.
It is difficult for the common people of the society, middle class and lower middle class to get rid of the wages.
There is nothing from Siachen, but from Kutch, but from Kamerup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gani-Phone.
Fonds have been done from all the places .
This is a pleasant experience.
They sent their messages to all ages.
I like to listen to some messages myself, very well.
My team is working on them.
But the reason for this is that they cannot watch TV and listen to radio tape.
I know how important the radio is for the visually impaired.
I am seeing another new angle, I am telling you how many good things they have made - it is enough to make the government aware.
Pawan Acharya has sent a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
Soil values are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on Vinayak Chaviti.
Our army, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Air Force, Navy, protecting the country's territory, sea and sky.
50 years of war with Pakistan were completed in 1965.
In this regard, a gallantry exhibition was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
I saw it very carefully .
The fight against Hajipur was done in Gani and Chaminda, but the hair remains blooming on seeing the successful scenes of Mandi and Hajipur pass.
History is linked to our heritage.
I would like you and your family - if you are around Delhi then I would like this visit to a few more days.
Don't go on seeing it quickly like the four.
I went back in two and a half hours.
A young boy ordered the Prime Minister, but the boy forgot to call his name quickly.
For the first time since independence, there has been a discussion of hours on the issue of cleanliness in the Parliament.
I am seeing good in it .
It also looks forward to discussing the cleanliness of the country.
On the one hand, parliamentarians and neighbours of the country are talking about cleanliness.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi will say.
Once he has said that if he has to choose one of both freedom and hygiene, he will choose cleanliness, he added.
Cleanliness is more important than Gandhijis independence.
He wanted to know about the centenary of Deendayal ji.
2nd October is the birth anniversary of revered Bapuji, Mahatma Gandhi.
The Khadi leader will be able to buy any worker or khadi from Rs. 5, 15 and Rs.
This joy also gives you a little share.
During my visit to Kolkata in May, members of the family of Subhash Chandra Bose had met.
Chandra Bose, the son of his brother, was established.
This evening was happy and happy with the family members of Subhash Babu.
Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process and over 50 members of Subhash Bose's family had come to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
But more enjoyable is that I will never have the opportunity to host such a great man's family to the Prime Minister's residence in October.
More than 50 people living in different countries are coming here for this reason.
Is it a moment to enjoy me
The precious authority I have received is safe.
In the meantime, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people.
One of the classes of students called TB Pande.
There is some improvement in the Central Universities at Banaras Hindu University.
But in such a small age, I have been interested in physics related matters.
I saw his belief, belief, belief, whether there is a micro-technology in that he said.
I wish that all the children of the country will be interested in scientific matters.
Sometimes there is a joy for such works.
Sometimes our Akashwani colleagues - half an hour .
But I would like to appreciate your feelings.
Thank you for your information.
It's still alright for months.
You know that the Mann Ki Baat programme has been a year in a way.
You know how much Subhash Babu used radio.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to conduct radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Urdu, Pusto and Urdu all languages.
I also have a year while talking in the auspicious voice.
My Mann Ki Baat - in my mind, your words have become meaningful because of your reason.
It's me, but those fruits are on my own.
Your suggestions should be beautiful.
Your suggestions will also benefit the government.
The fucking starts.
Mann Ki Baat, 2015
Once I got the opportunity to tell the words in my mind .
People are immersed in Ombara in the far southern direction and celebrated the sacred Raksha Bandhan festival across the country.
The Government of India has entered many new methods for social security of common people .
11 crore households have reached this scheme since the launch of this scheme for my obesity information.
On the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking to you that I have done Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way a year ago.
The opportunity of youth is also found . In one year Bangkoking Rang , economic system , lice .
Don't stop opening accounts only.
Our poor have been able to get loans from the bank.
These banks are yours, you don't leave them now.
I have brought them to you, now it is your duty to buy them.
Our bank accounts should be alive.
I am sure you're gonna be supposed to.
Recently, incidents and violent incidents in Gujarat have hampered the entire country.
Anything happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel will hurt the entire country.
But in a short span of time, the elders of Gujarat, my brother-in-law and all the citizens have made the situation.
He has played a crucial role in tackling the situation.
This is the true path of peace, unity and harmony.
Their speeches, their speeches, the generosity of the Sufi sect, the harmony in which O Music is hidden.
I have experienced all this while being among them.
I believe that how much is the need to inform the whole world about the true nature of immortality.
I am confident that the love and liberality of the Sufi tradition will bring this message to far-flung areas.
I am also telling others that we need to understand the Sufi tradition even though we have followed any religion.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity soon.
Buddhist scholars from many countries of the world will come to Buddha Gaya in India.
I was invited to participate in this and I am happy to be invited to Buddha Gaya as they have come to me.
The first Prime Minister of our country, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
Even before this, I have mentioned this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We issued an Ordinance on earthquake.
Tomorrow, the Ordinance will be terminated on 31st August.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that it will not only be the Department of Agriculture but it will also be the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare - we have taken this decision very fast.
You don't need to be scared.
It is common to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri when the 1965 war was proposed.
It is common to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
It is a matter of privilege to commemorate the martyrs of Indias Tricolor medal and its pride.
Such historical events always inspire us.
Last week, I had a pleasant opportunity to meet the people of Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the workshops at the field level
We need to take it forward as a chance.
Speaking on the occasion, I said in the following minds that what kind of dreams they have in their eyes, how much the students have to move towards vision science, how many opportunities they have, and how many opportunities are there, I once again reiterate that.
Especially to my young friends.
Everybody is running . In the lower level they can also be the cause of water .
The decision to get rid of small jobs from interview office is now approximately implemented.
This is the first time that the meeting will be held in other countries outside the US.
Till now, about 50 thousand pregnant women and 13 lakh children are still diagnosing at the time of delivery or delivery every year in our country.
As we get rid of polio, we also get rid of tetanus about mother and infant mortality.
There are news about dengue in this middle.
We don't make death so easy.
How much price is life .
Not paying attention to drinking water, and surviving sanitation, these are the causes of death - it is not possible.
Dengue tests are available at 514 centres across the country.
Now we cannot get the opportunity to change for the country but if we have the privilege of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced Indias pride.
Sometimes due to lack of awareness, we make our youth unjust.
I believe that this is centuries ago.
My experience is different from the youth.
Sometimes you talk to the youth - there is a chance to learn from them.
They say that 'Sande on Cycle' is a quick fish.
Some say that we are playing a cycle day a week.
Manki Baat , June 2019 .
My beloved country , and my blessings .
Sometimes we were inspiring ourselves .
In the middle of this I can imagine how to spend time .
On Sunday , last Sunday 11 o'clock I felt as if I had lost something .
Definitely feels .
Probably this is not an unparalleled program .
In this program there was life , feeling their own mind , heart was stuck , therefore this very little exhibition that came to this program was very difficult for me .
But this Sunday has waited very much .
In the last few months, many messages have come and people are also missing Mann Ki Baat.
I am very good when I read them , when I heard them .
Why did I travel to Kedarnath in how many acquaintances I asked many people to question .
You can enjoy your curiosity .
I also feel like participating those feelings with you .
But if they talk then the form of 'Man Ki Baat' changes.
In how many acquaintances , in the contribution of Jaypajaya , even more polio I am Baaldera .
Many people have discovered the meaning of Rajiki in it .
It's my bullshit, I'm a chance to spend with me.
Everything can be said now that Gani can tell only one thing. Because of the small flight coming in the line of ' Mann Ki Baat ' there has been a chance of filling the light in my mind in the valleys of Kedar , in that single cave .
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
When I do it , but definitely do it .
Because I have that right on you.
In the matter of Kedar the people were surprised to see some positive things with the same curiosity , I have seen many times in your words .
Sometimes my thoughts also keep on talking to you .
Together with bringing people , country , society problems , challenges in my sight they also tell their results .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then while proclaiming his wrath on polluted pollution also keeps exhibiting efforts for cleanliness .
That is , how the results of a kind of problems are seen in your words in the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like a glass of fury of society.
It is known by this that there is no dearth of internal power , strength , talent situated in the country .
It is necessary to coordinate those strengths and talents and provide an opportunity to enable them to act.
One more thing is known by this Mann Ki Baat that all 130 crore people want to participate actively and efficiently in the development of the country.
When I analyze such things, you can imagine how much strength I get in my mind.
Accurately I didn't come, you brought me, sitting. You gave me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling we take the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There was an attack in the mind of all the people .
Therefore the country has invited so many people not only for itself but for its own use but for the protection of democracy .
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of this country have seen such a number of elections in 77 (Debruary 7) without taking the rest of their rights, powers and requirements for democracy.
Today, how many accomplishments of democracy have been organised in our country today, from wealth to the poor, everybody participated in this festival with joy to decide the future of our country.
When one thing is with us, we underestimate it, we also ignore its amatic facts.
But if we leave a China in the world, we can say that more than the population of any country in the rest of the world, we have voted today.
How many people have voted in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America , approximately double .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
This introduces the vastness of our democracy.
The number of civilizations in 2019 is still the biggest democracy of the world in history .
In such a way in order to celebrate how many acquaintances human power , arrangements are needed .
It is possible that lakhs of teachers , rulers , workers work at night .
In order to fulfil this magnificence of democracy, about three lakh semi-military teams have taken up their responsibilities and 20 lakh police personnel from various states have also worked at a dignified level.
As a result of their hard industry this time more Ooting has been done once .
Approximately 10 lakh Polling stations across the country , more than 40 lakh EVM machines , over 17 lakh Vivipat machines , how big arrangements you can imagine .
It has been done that no Ooty should not come to use its Ooty .
A polling station has been set up for only one female Ooty in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you can surprising .
But this is the real pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place of the world is located in India .
This is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , there is also another pride of this pride .
Perhaps for the first time in history, women also participated in Ooting equally with men.
The quantity of women , men polio is approximately equal .
Although the fact of exciting enthusiasm is that today 78 -LRB- seventy -RRB- women are epidemic in parlor .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times saying, 'Boke not Book'.
In welcome - welcome we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Approximately many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, I gave a book "Prem Chand Ki Lok Dear Kahania".
It liked me well .
I got a chance of reading some stories again when I did not get long time , while staying in labor .
Their stories reflect the emotions of the entire India.
When they read the story of 'Nasha', my eyes turned towards the economic imbalances of the society.
I remembered how many nights were spent in the churches on this matter when I was young .
We know that the son of Jamindar, Ishwari, the heroes of the poor family, without being careful, whenever the effect of evil conscience falls.
The second story of 'Id Gah', the heart of a child, the heart of his grandmother, the pure love of his grandmother, and his purity in such a small age.
It is said that taking hold from Hamid seed of 4 . years to go to Namada , actually the pride of human heart is pride .
The last lines of this story are not able to do so much emotional , small Hamid is playing Hamid Part - old Amina , Amina became a small sin .
Likewise, Pus Ki Rat is a marvellous story.
In this story a poor painting of life is seen .
It is enjoyed that if his fruit was destroyed then Haldu Ratu had to lie down at night like a copper of the field in the trembling cold .
In reality this story is a century old , it seems sufficient for today .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If I talk about reading, I will read about Akshara Library in Kerala in some media.
If this library is one of the dense forests of Idukki then you will not be surprised .
The primary school student there is P . .
K.
Both of them were polluted for this library .
Once the buildings of books have to be taken on the shoulders .
Today this library is looking for everybody along with tribal children .
Wanche Gujarat (Church Gujarat) is a successful experiment in Gujarat.
All the ages of lakhs participate in this park .
Definitely write the book that you read in the NarendraModi App and all the listeners in the Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of our country think about the challenges of the future besides the present.
I saw the NarendraModi App, reading your explanations in my newspapers and many people are writing about the problem of water.
In Belgavi Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, and Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems related to me .
Water is very important in our culture .
It has been said about the water of the observation in the Raghaveda . Apostha Mao Bhuvan , Sthan Urja Dattatha , Maharnaya Chakshas , Yovatamo Rasa , Tasya Bhajata , Ushtiriva Matara meaning water is the power of life , energy .
Everyday the problem of water in many places of the country is lifting up the head .
In the water of rain water falling along with the year we can hide only 8  water that you will not be surprised .
Only 8  .
The time has to be discovered for this problem .
Like the rest of the problems, with the participation of people , with the capacity of hundred and fifty crore countrymen , with the help of support , with the help of support of this problem also we have discovered this problem .
A new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country, especially considering the importance of water.
By this decisions can be taken fast in all the things related to water .
Christian I did a new work .
All the serpentines of the country have written the norths of the village .
To smoke water for the villagers , to collect water , to collect rain water every drop of rain water they have written a collection in the village council , to discuss with the villagers .
In this work the whole week participated with full enthusiasm in this month 22th honeymoon thousands of people were distressed .
People in the villages have made a pledge at every drop of water.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I will listen to you a surprising word.
The Loopung Panchayat surpass of Katam Sandi Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand is giving a message to all of us, my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their part for water conservation once again .
Everybody 's heads of the village , everybody 's serpents have many ruins for their activity .
People of the village feel like competition to build their village water temple .
Before I see the positive results of warmth with the attempt of social efforts .
There is no fermility for the result of the problem of water throughout the country .
Therefore, efforts are being made in different areas of the country , in different ways .
By this the problem of water logging is removed .
There has been a major change in the small ponds built in the fields of Kabir Dham in Rajasthan.
20,000 women have worked collectively to revive the Naga river in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that in Garhwal, all women work a lot on rain water harvesting.
I believe that such efforts are being made very strong that if we try to make the impossible as well .
My first request - how the people of the country have made cleanliness a mass movement, as well as for water conservation.
Together, we will pledge to collect every drop of water, I believe that water is the Prasad of Parmeshwar.
To save one drop of water we make a necessity garden .
Talk about the problems related to water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
I am particularly keen to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation, especially for the heads of various areas.
Do not let films , play games , do not let our friends of media , but let people of social institutions but let people of cultural institutions but prophesy , everybody has their own way .
Make the society wake up , do the society together , work with the society .
Look, we definitely see changes in our eyes.
I have to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If you have the opportunity to visit Porbandar, Puja Bapu's birth place, there is a house behind the priest Bapu's house where there is a water storage tank of 200 years.
Therefore, I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then definitely see that water tank.
Come , we inspire people to conserve water conservation by making maximum information related to water conservation .

The need for holistic health care has increased , in which the importance of yoga has increased .

Therefore the propagation of yoga is a great society service .
Do not pay attention to the identity of this service .
I am very happy to note that the Prime Minister's Awards Proclamation for those who played a special role in the promotion and development of Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how important it has played in propagating and propagating Yoga throughout the world.
For example, 'Japan Yoga Niketan' has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and continuous courses.
Later, Ms.
Antonietta Roy, an individual, started Sarvayog International and propagated Yoga throughout Europe.
All these are sufficient .
In the matter related to yoga there is no proposal behind Indians .
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya and Munger have also received this award and it has been dedicated to Yoga for the past decades.
Both of these awards have made this Yoga dey even more important for those who have taken the message of Yoga at home.

Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
If these are starting Manki Baat then mind is heavy .
The Christian Bharat had lost his sons for ten days .
These paradise have lost their lives for the protection of 125 crores of our country .
For the people of the country to sleep peacefully these sons saved us from their sleep .
Our warriors are always exhibiting unparalleled adventure , courage .
The feelings of the martyrs of Baghalpur in Bihar, Ratan Thakur's father, Ram Niranjan, also inspires all of us in such sad moments.
It is said that his second son also sends to fight with enemies , it is necessary that he also fights .

Such feelings , we are seen in the houses of our Veer , Parakram , Amravir .

The Amar Vijay Maurya family of Deoria , the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra , the son of the martyr of the fort , Hem Raj , six sons of the fort , who are alright , the story of every family of these martyrs is full of inspiration .
I am trying to understand the feelings exhibited by these families , to understand the feelings of exhibition .
The living testimony situated in front of our eyes is an inspiration for the future of India .
My beloved countrymen, after coming to independence, we all are waiting for the symbol of war memorial .
I was surprised that there was no memorial of national war in India .
It is a memorial symbol of the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I decided to make such a memorial in the country .
It is a matter of great pleasure to complete this construction in a very short time when we decided to build a national war memorial.
To morrow i . . February 25th honey , along with our crores of countries we gave this national soldiers to the army .
This is a small attempt to fulfil their imagination .
This memorial has been built near the heart of Delhi i. e.
It is believed that visiting this national military memorial is equal to visiting a pilgrimage to the people of the country .
After the independence of the country the symbol of seeing the soldiers given maximum sacrifice for the country is the symbol of this national military memorial .
The symbol of this memorial exhibits the unique adventure of our martyrs .
The National Military Memorial is based on four concentrative circles imagining the entire journey from the birth of every soldier to the sacrifice.
The jewellery of the Amar Chakra is a symbol of the martyrs of the martyrs .
The second chakra of Shaurya chakra .
There is a queue of dense trees in this wheel .
Seeing on the monument , to know about the important martyrs of our country , to tell them thanks , to discover them , to discover them , it has become a place to visit this national military memorial .
Here are the stories of those who sacrificed their lives to stay safe from our lives, to develop the country.
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the important words of our army , police , Para Military teams .
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate this national military memorial to the country.
For the protection of all of us along with the continuation of women police , even more men Police Sibbadi we are a reflection of the thoughts of expressing thanksgiving thanksgiving .
I am sure to see all the national military memorials , national police memorials .
Whenever you go there , definitely share the photographs taken there in social media so that others also get inspiration to go there .
My dear countrymen, for the Mann Ki Baat, you will get the opportunity to read thousands of answers, explanations and meditations.
This time when I read your explanations, I have seen an interesting suggestion written by Ashish Mukhopadhyay.
What is he that in 1900 , March 3th March the British Birsa Munda had done Birsa Munda , his age was only slaughtered .
It is said that in Mann Ki Baat of Birsa Munda , Jamshed ji Tata offering tributes to both of them is like reminding the history of glorious Jharkhand , heritage .
These two important officers have not only increased the Kirti of India but also of Jharkhand .
Ganu Yavat India is grateful to them for their support.
It is necessary to know about some inspirational personality of the youth , that is the synonym of Birsa Munda .
And the British took him while he was asleep .
Why do you know why they have done such a church
He had seen this in his small life only .
In the lives of bursting , mosquitoes the sunlight is filled .
Mahabhavan had sacrificed his lives in the small age of Birsa Munda .
But itching is that the stories of sacrifice , beauty , sacrifices of those places have not been given to today .
He is well aware of how important it is for the future to make India a hub of science, technology and industry.
From his far-flung point of view Tata Institute of Science has been established which is now called Indian Institute of Science .
Besides this he established many world levels like Tata Steel etc .
Jamshed jeeep Tata Tower , Samavas Swami Vivekananda had taken place in a ship in America .
My dear countrymen, on February 29, the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Murji Bhai Deshai.
Today only four years comes .
Murji Bhaibhai full of natural , peaceful personality is one of the most educational officers of India .
Morji Bhai Deshai was named as the most budgetary person in the Independent Parliament of India.
During the difficult time of the development of the country in danger , the country was run by its expert leadership .
To save the democracy the emergency of Murji Bhai is also drowned in fighting against the emergency of the country .
Therefore in his old age also he had to pay heavy roots .
Since then the government had also kept him in jail .
In 1977 he became the prime minister when the victory of January was successful .
He brought 44th state in the eleventh century .
It is important that the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution (Amendment of the Emergency) is to reduce the Supreme Court's power and other such provisions are like harmful to our democratic values.
In this way , in 1975 as the reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive reproductive organisations have been done forever in future .
In order to maintain the grandeur of Indian democracy his precious support is always remembered by the future .
I dedicate such a great duke once again .
How excitement has been shown about the Padmasambhavas of my favorite country , every time .
This is why we are stepping towards a new India therefore we should pride those who go to their work with self-confidence at the same level .
With their difficulty people bring suitable changes in the lives of others in various ways .
It is believed that without falling along with any name the work of working on the ground is done by standing on the ground . Yoga Kaushal of Yoga is seen living in a way .
Dautari Nak had made the hill with his hands only three kilometres long way by excavating the hill with his hands .
Take Abdul Ghafur Khatri of Gujarat only . He has done a marvellous work of reviving the genetic disease of Kutch region .
Internationally he is doing an important task of giving this art to new generations .
I gave the art of Tree of Life art painted by Abdul Ghafur Khatri to President Barack Obama of America.
The Padmasambhava had recognized the service of Shebbir Said Gomata of Marathwada .
You will be surprised by listening to the Tao Porchon-Linch of America. Linch has become a living yoga institution.
Even in the age of hundreds she has given training to the people worldwide in yoga . she has now made fifteen hundred yoga trainings .
Famous with the name of Lady Torjan in Jharkhand, the adventurous work of fighting with Timber Mafia Tonu , Naksalet has been done by the name of Lady Torjan besides protecting the wildlife area of fifty hectares besides the protection of trees , wildlife sanctuaries .
Kisan Chachi of Muzaffarpur in Bihar i.e. the story of Rajkumari Devi is very inspirational.
In the direction of making women empowerment , even more beneficial agriculture is a example .
My beloved countrymen, I want to share with you all about the feeling of a heart that I am happening for some days.
I want to meet PM-A i. e. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat.
Approximately twelve lakh families of brother , Sadri Manulara , last five months have been found by this myth .
I have seen what changes are happening due to this technique in the lives of poor people .
If you also know the poor people suffering from not getting wealthy for treatment , then tell them about this technique .
This technique is the desire of such poor families .
The time of testing in my favorite country Prajalara , schools has come .

Students, their teachers and parents can see the full recording of this programme in YouTube and best wishes to all my exams for the upcoming tests.
My beloved country people , talking about India there is no proposal about festivals .
In our country without any significance , there is no day without any festival .
I went to Kashi for some days before my beloved country , where I got the opportunity to spend some Divya brothers and sisters .
It is said that I am swallowing the prime minister .
It has also been very enjoyed to know that besides listening to me , people remember Manki Baat many times .
In reality I was impressed by seeing the power of that Divya brother .
My beloved countrymen, through the Mann Ki Baat program, I have a special experience.
Through the medium of radio in a way I celebrate face with crores of families every month .
Many times by talking to all of you, by reading your answers, by listening to the opinions you have told in the phone, all of you seem to make me a person in your family.

I am an impression on myself.
Recognizing healthy delivery system , coming to Manki Baat , May is on Sunday .
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shri Shri Shivakumar Swami Ji is not yet a news.
Shiva Kumar Swami had dedicated all his life to the service of the society .
Bhagwan Basaveshwar taught us as Kayakvi Kailash , that is , keeping thy duty working hard is like going to Shiva 's residence Kailash .
Shivakumar Swamiji walked on this very well .
He is a church .
Only to give food , shelter , education , spiritual knowledge to people he spent his life with his life .
The rails are the most important thing for him in life .
Definitely animals , agricultural vegetation keeps on running through Siddhaganga Math .
A poet of the priests of Kalana had also heard that contribution .
All the lives of Shri Shri Shiva Kumar Swami, Siddhaganga Monastery, are dedicated to Dr. Kalanji by this poetry.
Once I offer my devotion to this great grandeur .
My favorite country Prajalara , 1950 , January 26 came to the kingdom of our country .
On that day our country has become a Republic country .
We celebrated our reproductive day with pride , pride .
But I want to say these things .
Seeing how many types of arrangements happen in India the whole world will be surprised .
You must have heard about Gujarat.
In a beautiful place of Gir jungle only one polio shoes are put for one Ooty .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for one Ooty , with the purpose of using his Ooty , how many accidents the hair of the workers go to far off places .
This is the beauty of our Republic .
To keep our reproductive system strong I am giving how many accidents falling continuously .
I am also impossible to participate in how many types of activities , independent , independent , unsuccessful , how many accidents of all the states , the rest of the industries .
The responsibility of all this should be for us .
It is believed that in large numbers our young Ooty rivers their names , with their participation gives more strength to our democracy .
My beloved country , on this sacred India many great men had done some marvellous works for humanity .
On 23 January 23th honey Yavat India celebrated his Jayanti in a different way .
I got the fortune of starting a museum built in the memory of the Mahavirs who gave their participation in the freedom struggle of India .
Do you know that many rooms were closed in the Red Fort of independence
How beautiful museums have been fulfilled in all the rooms closed .
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Ki, a museum for Indian National Army, '--' and '1857-Eighteen Fifty Seven, India's First War of Independents.
In every brick of the rooms situated in these museums our glorious history is full of Taluku .
In this very very place the English government had run on the sons of India - Karnal love Sehgal , Karnal Gurubhaksh Singh Dillo , Major Janal Shahnwaj Khan .
When the memorials related to Netaji in the Kranti Temple of the Red Fort were displayed by the family members of Netaji .
It is necessary to discover the beauty of our nervous system , patriotism again in different forms of new forms .
Last month on 30th December I went to Andaman Nicobar Island .
75 years Christian where Netaji had flyed Trivarnapattanam , at the same place again Trivarnapattanam was flying .
In October 2018, people were surprised to see the flying of the Tricolor in the Red Fort because there is a habit of flying the national flag of August fifteen.
We flew 75 years in the whole contribution of Azad Hind Sarkar .
Subhash Babu always remembers a heroic soldier , a specialist .
Many years have been desired to make the fruits related to Netaji .
It's joyful to me that we're sorry.
On the day of coming to the whole of the family of Netaji family I remember even more .
We told many pockets about Netaji together . Netaji had glorified the faith of Netaji .
I enjoyed a lot of joy to develop some places connected with many great leaders of India .
26 related to Babasaheb Ambedkar , Alipur Road , Sardar Patel Museum , Kranti Temple etc .
If you come to Delhi then definitely visit these places .
My beloved countrymen, today we are talking about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, so I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I never considered radio as a medium to meet humans .
The method of talking to Subhash Babu in radio was different .
People like the programs running in Azad Hind Radio .
Due to these programs our freedom fighters also got a lot of strength .
A sight museum has also been built in this Kranti temple .
How attractive attempts have been made about Indian art , cultures .
In the museum there are excellent paintings like Amritsar Shergil , Raja Ravi Varma , Avanendranath Tagore , Gangendranath Tagore , Nandal Bose , Jamini Rai , Saloj Mukherji , etc . in the museum .
Going there you must also see the pictures of Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore .
Talking about Chitrakoot , Gurudevs see the excellent pictures of Ravindranath Tagore .
Till now you will know that Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is a writer , a musician .
But Gurudevi is also a painting .
The main thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not kept any name for his most pictures .
He used to understand his pictures , understanding that picture itself , understanding the message situated in that picture with his point of view .
His chicken pox is also exhibited in European countries , Russ , America .
I believe that you will definitely go to see his pictures in the Kranti temple .
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints , their thoughts , their works have given the message of goodness , equality , even more social authority .
Such a saddle Sanctuary is Ravidas .
February19 Ravidas is the Jayanti of Ravidas .
The mosquitoes of Sanctuary have been very famous .
Sant Ravidas used to give big messages in small words only .
He is supposed to have a banana tree rolling , layer of marine layer , layer of red layer , but there is nothing inside , the tree breaks over .
The birthplace of Guru Ravidas had taken place in Varanasi .
Sanctuary Ravidas had tried to tell the importance of labor , even more labors through his messages throughout his life .
It is not wrong to make an attempt to tell the importance of the world in reality .
That is , if you are heartless , then God lives in your heart .
The messages of Sanctuary have influenced the people of all kinds . Chittod Maharaja , queens , ueens , Mirabai , all the first weeks .
Talking things like increasing interest on the international programs in the students , some new , students want to think about crossing the atmosphere of the sky , do not want to talk to me with the water , especially for our children .

In the economy of all the houses for housing about 40 lakh houses in 23 states were geo-tagged .

Some doctors of Patna have told me that some days Christian workers are treating the poor freely by making camps .
There apart from making such treatment camps every month of heart , lungs Critic Centre , apart from getting free tests for many types of diseases they also get free treatment done in those camps .
Every month hundreds of poor patients get benefit from these camps .
This doctor 's enthusiasm is really reproductive .
I am proud to say that by the efforts of social efforts the cleanliness park was successful .

At one place many countries were flying national flags .
It is estimated that people from more than one hundred fifty countries will come to this Kumbh Mela starting in Prayag.
I have inaugurated the Integrated Command and Control Centre where the devotees will get the help of this.
This time how much attention is being paid in the Kumbh fair , cleanliness .
If there is cleanliness along with devotion in arrangements , then it is a good thing about it .
This time every traveller gets the pilgrimage of Akshay tree after the sacred Sangam bath .
This Akshay tree symbol of the belief of the people had stayed inside the fort of hundreds of years therefore devotees could not visit it .
Now the door of Akshay tree has been opened for everyone .
When you come to Kumbh Mela then take photographs in different contexts and share with everyone in social meditation so that most people get inspiration to go to Kumbh Mela.
This Kumbh full of spirituality , Indian philosophy should be an important Kumbh .
This Kumbh of devotees should be given an important Kumbh of the world tourism .
This year we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of our worshipped Bapu .
Siril Ramposa, President of South Africa, is fortunate to be the chief guest of our Republic Day celebrations this time.

Both Bapu and Mandela are not only the foundations of the Yavat world but their ideals always encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd day of October 2014, the Mann Ki Baat programme was started on the occasion of the Vijayadashmi festival and we all started a journey through Mann Ki Baat.
The journey of Mann Ki Baat Dharawahi is fulfilling fifty bags with it .
Therefore this is our golden Jubilee Episode , that is , the golden festival of Manki Baat .
This time the phone calls , norths coming from all of you have also proposed to recognize this golden festival .
Anshu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav in My Gau
What is the whole week , people say that you are very high technology technology , social media , mobile ypnotise , mobile ypnotise .
But why do you choose radio through the medium of meeting with people
I have to tell you a story .
It was in 1998 .
This is the time I worked as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
The cost of ' Bharat ' is called a bomb .
I don't understand what I am.
Then he said , Behold , on keeping radio listening to radio , the same thing has been discussed on the same thing .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had come forward and told that how much of this tea has been done on that day .
I was estimated the power of radio .
It is natural to turn my eyes towards the most powerful medium after I became the Prime Minister.
The feedback coming in this survey is very interesting .
How much expansive church has also been discussed about positive .
This is a unique example of positive emotions , positive emotions situated in the minds of all the people of our country .
Because of the Mann Ki Baat program the feeling of volunteerism i . . clean service has also increased some experiences .
People are coming forward at a height of big height for the service of society .
I am very happy to change the radio more favorite for the people due to the Mann Ki Baat program .
The expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expans
Modi comes , goes but this country remains stable .
All these small stories of the country of 130 crore are alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , giving new enthusiasm to the highest peaks .
My experiences also participate with you all along with water .
After that slowly this thing moves towards a change by buying houses , social meditation , Watsop .
The younger is also learning to keep his households standing, sometimes in the phone calls to the Prime Minister.
How can the government be able to provide self-withdaughter propaganda from a small village in Haryana, not only in the country but also abroad
Many times Manki Baat has also been identified but in my mind at times 130 crore people of the country are always there .
And they said unto them , My heart is my heart .
Mann Ki Baat is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, a revered India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glory of the fiftyth Manki Baat Taluku is that besides a prime minister you are asking a nearby man i . . democracy .
If you want to answer your question easily - there is nothing to be ready .
Absolutely Man Ki Baat is a very easy task for me .
Every time the north of the people come in front of Manki Baat .
People share their thoughts in My Gau and Narendra Modi Mobile Apps and there is also a toll free number - 1800117800.
People who photographed this number record their message with their throat .
My attempt to read more north , more expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive excitements .
I hear many phone calls myself .
Do not fall near the Mann Ki Baat program , how much I read the thoughts sent by you during the journey .
Every moment all the people of my country stay in my mind . Therefore those who read the north , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only a piece of kitchen .
In reality things i . . the name of water village , person etc . mouth .
Whether the throat of Mann Ki Baat is my throat, examples, emotions and excitement are the people of my country. I thank everyone who participated in Mann Ki Baat.
If they do not read their north , expansively then the number of people sending northerns , expansives is in lakhs .
An effort is also being made to bring in view the unparalleled answers and information related to the Mann Ki Baat.
I am telling blessed to all my colleagues of radio , television , remaining T . . . Channels , social meditation .
Because of their hard work Manki Baat has reached most people .
All the Manki Baat program of the sky Vrindavani Vrindavan is published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to Manki Baat with the voice living close to the throat in the province language as well .
In the same way they are turning into Nrandra Modi along with those three minutes .
All of you also want to listen to the Manki Baat program in your language .
Everybody also believes that less voluntary collection has been done about themselves , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat have changed the media into its own things.
Media has worked forward by giving a new form to many things like cleanliness, road safety, drugs free India, self-defence with daughter etc.
If you do not have your help then my journey of this Manki Baat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much, Garu, for your phone call.
If you want to tell the truth then I have no secret .
It is easy to understand anybody in front of us that the old things of our own life are not obstacles .
Sometimes our paralysis gives the biggest obstacle to the conversation of our birds .
It is my first priority to understand anything instead of confessing , not confessing , not confessing .
I am trying to speak with youth in various programs or social media.
I am trying to understand what they do , thinking .
The youth question is very good .
They're busy in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our surroundings , social entertainment , startups , sports , or any other kind of society has brought big changes in the society .
Does the courage of questioning , adventurous dreams of big dreams
If we bring young thoughts to the ground, we give freedom to express them then they can bring changes in the country .
My beloved countrymen, from Gurugram to Vineetapuram in Mai Gau, I would like to talk about the day of the state coming to Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i. e.
It is said that today it is very special , because we are asking the state from today in the fifty years .
Blessed are many blessed for your information .
All these Mahamahals gave us such an expansive , expansive state .
Time management cool , Productive City is also an example of the construction of Veerta state with an extraordinary speed .
This also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during record .
This is the confluence of the important talents of the country and the people of the country should be empowered and the poor people have also worked together to provide a state of ability.
The responsibility of Haklu , responsibilities have been described in our state . That is the speciality of our state .
These two coordinations take the country forward in the lives of the country .
Identify myself, when 60 years of India's state was completed in 2010, we swim on the elephant of the state book in Gujarat.
It is an attempt to introduce the estimation of the state in youth , to introduce them to introduce the estimation of the state .
In the form of a democracy in 2020, we will complete fifty years and we will complete seventy five years of independence by 2022.
If my beloved country is talking about the kingdom , state council , then the root of the kingdom standing in the center of the kingdom is unforgettable .
Praswamy Babasaheb is located in the Naras of Babasaheb . The preservation of India has not come from outside .
What is the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost .
India First : This is the basic mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
Once worshipped Babasaheb , Ambedakar , the son of Ambedakar , is a reverence .
Guru Nanak Dev had always played with the category of people .
For the society he had seen the way of truth , Karma , service , compassion , self-confidence .
In the coming year, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev is celebrated with great joy and enjoyment of these festivals not only in the country but also in the whole world.
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival gloriously .
In this way 550 Jayanti festivals of Guru Nanak are celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak .
When I participated in a meeting related to this, I remembered Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
Due to the earthquake of Gujarat coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got heavy injured .
But the state government , local people associated with that Gurudwara renovated the renovation of that Gurudwara is a example of this .
The Government of India has taken a big decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen can easily visit the sacred place of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur in Pakistan.
Come , let us move ahead even more .
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31th October 31th honey all of us are the Jayanti of the favorite Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
Every year on that day also the youth of the country has been ready to participate in ' Run for Unity ' running for unity .
Now the weather is also pleasant .
I would like to participate in this race for unity in large numbers.
Six-and-a-half months before independence, on 27 January 1947, the world-renowned international epic, Time Magazine, published a reflection of Sardar Patel on the composition of the journal.
This journal in its Lead Store has given a journal of India .
But it is not like the pavilion of India which we see .
It is a part of India divided into many parts .
Approximately 550 national institutions were there in the country .
The interest of the English in India has decreased but they want to go to India in pieces .
Time magazine has also discovered other storeys of human life in his business .
In 1920, how did he organise helpful programs in the floods that came in Ahmedabad, how Bardoli had guided the Satyagraha.
Sirdar Patel has seen the impossible work done by discovering each problem , fulfilling the country .
Seeing all this India bound with Akta Sutra , we remind us of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel directly .
This statue, established on the river Narmada in Gujarat, is doubled to the Statue of Liberty in America.
This is a very big idol of the world .
Every Indian is now proud that the biggest statue of the world is in our country .
Not only this , Sardar Patel situated on the ground is now increasing the beauty of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
I believe that the people of every part of India consider this place as the most favorite museum of this idol .
My beloved brothers and sisters , thou hast celebrated the ' Infantry Day ' of all our country .
I am bowing to all those participating in the Indian army .
I am also giving their adventure to the families of our soldiers .
But why do all our countrymen celebrate this ' Infantry Day '
On this day, our Indian soldiers saved the Kashmir valley from the square paths asked on the grass of Kashmir.
This historical event is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .
I read the old interval of Taluku -LRB- epidemic -RRB- of a great Indian army officer Sammanekshaw once .
In that conference Field Marshal Sammanekshaw , he remembered the days of his clinical .
At that time, in October 1947, military fights started in Kashmir.
It is said that in one conclusion of the delay of sending the army to Kashmir the soldiers of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had reminded the Fild Marshal Sammankshaw that in that conclusion the soldiers of Kashmir were also not able to get delayed in their own way .
Nobody likes the cost of my favorite country , sports .
Sports , strength , capacity , capacity - all these are important in the world .
These are a sports of a sports .
How important is this four qualities for the construction of any country .
In the youth of that country there are all these properties , that country not only develops economic , science , technology but also flys its victory in sports .
Italy has been done to me two times .
In the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta, we got the opportunity to meet our Para Athletes.
Our Para Athletes, who have created a record by conducting a total of 72 medals in these sports, have enhanced Indias pride.
These efficient para athletes have been fortunate to meet themselves.
Similarly, the summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina has got the opportunity to meet the 2018 winners.
You will be happy to know that in the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth has exhibited their talent more than that.
In these competitions, our country has won three other medals in the mix event with thirteen medals.
This time in Asia cricket also our country will remember all of you .
In a few minutes how many times I have used it more important than this .
India is not only in sports but also in the fields of imagination, India has set new records.
After coming out of the orphanage temple, he cleaned the DTC buses and worked like a waiter in Dhabal on the roads in Delhi to spend his life.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , golden medals of India .
Not only this , see the capacity of increasing in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympic medal in both Judo, Senior Level, Junior Level.
But in the Europe Olympics Tababi Devi has created history by studying the silver medal .
Sixteen young sportsperson Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
If the father go to the cooling , then the mother ' s fish was sold .
Many times there is no money for food in their house .
In such a situation also the courage of Tabba Devi has not decreased .
The history of neck has created history for the country .
Every young cricket, he is a recognition of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember, we have successfully organised the FIFA Under17 World Cup in 2017.
The world has given it the most successful tournament.
We have also created a new Orissa in the FIFA Under17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh audiences from the stadiums of different places of the country have been encouraged by seeing those football competitions , encouraging young sports .
This year, India got the privilege of organizing the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup starts on 28 November 16 December .
The Indian sports playing any kind of game or some Indian sports i . . hockey is definitely interesting .
There is a golden sports of India in Hockey sports .
Hockey mantra is known about the meditation of Major Chand .
After that Balvindar Singh Sinior , Leslie Claudius -LRB- Leslie Claudius -RRB- , Mohammad Shahid , Uddham Singh had decided a very big journey .
These are giving inspiration to new waves of hockey sports with their industry , sports with their industry .
Seeing the adventurous competitions is a good opportunity for sports lovers .
You all go to Bhubaneswar and see the hockey matches , encourage your players .
Many people are coming forward to organise my beloved country , social programs . They are also standing inspiration for all the people of the country .
We can see this heritage at every place , every place in the society coming to thousands of centuries .
But in this new age , new generations are coming forward to do this task with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'Self 4 Society'. My portal has also launched this portal to provide the right opportunities to the IT and electronic industry of the country.
Seeing the excitement , enthusiasm seen throughout the week to organise this program all Indians pride .
The journey from IT to society is not me, we are not, we are not, we are not, we are not, we are not, we have a journey of crossing ourselves.
Some children read , some elders are reading .
Some are paying attention to cleanliness , some are helping the rails .
There is no natural belief behind all these . only dedicated emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotionality .
A young man learned wheelchair basketball to help the hair of Divyas .
Mission mode activity i . e . this interest , this dedication .
Definitely prides .
The feeling of not me, we are inspiring all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I see all of you for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting explanation from Pondicherry to Shri Manish Mahatra.
What is he said in Mai Gau, "In the program of Mann Ki Baat, how important example of Indian tribal traditions, customs, nature along with nature," he said.
Mansh Garu , such a thing that I am impossible for proposing ahead of Manki Baat .
It is a good opportunity to inspire us to see our glorious culture , past , this thing is that the world , especially the western countries are celebrated to save the environment .
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should take care of us once that we should see our history , traditions once again .
Especially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals . It is in the culture of our tribals .
Our tribal brothers are worshipped by considering trees , trees , fruits and goddesses .
In the country of Madhya Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region residents of Bhil tribes of Bhil , Arjun trees are worshipped specially .
In the desert area like Rajasthan we saw how to conserve the environment .
Especially in the matter of conserving trees they are ready to sacrifice their lives but one tree also does not let harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers .
Wildlife is considered to be their lions .
In Nagaland also tigers are considered to be protectors of jungles .
In the Briding Season of Gond Category in Central India, fishing stops in some areas of Kethan river.
Tribals make their houses with natural substances which along with being strong they also do good for environment .
The smoke residing in the united areas of Nilgiri Peeth in south India makes a small smoke residing in the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke .
It is true that my beloved brothers and sisters, the tribal tribes believe that they want to live peacefully mixed with themselves but whoever harms their natural forests, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
My beloved countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we recognise the people who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Seeing small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
A common Ratu Gurubachan Singh 's son is married to work hard .
Before this marriage Gurubachan had married the parents of the married parents , but I was a shirt .
But after asking a common driver brother Gurubachan all of you will also be surprised . That is the true strength of our society .
Shri Gurubachan Singh's family has put an example in front of us.
I will read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha in Punjab.
Why did this village come to the churches of Kallar Majra , where the people there cooked cereals , instead of burning the rest of the cereals in the field , they are covered inside the soil , for this how much technology is required .
My best wishes to brother Gurubachan Singh.
I congratulate all the people trying to keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra .
You are walking ahead with the truth of the Indian tradition of clean life .
By mixing drops , chicken pox , small precautions , good tasks , positive tasks , always play a big role in making the environment of social environment .
In life , heart , in me , in thyself , in every particle of the world , at every place peace is established .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first World War was completed in November 111 .
The war was completed after the end of the war , then the loss of heavy destruction , population ends one century .
First World War is an important event for India.
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
Although our soldiers fought with so much virtue , how big role was played , most sacrificed .
On the coming of war they saw Indian soldiers to take anyone to the world .
In rare places , poisonous conditions also our soldiers have seen their beauty .
The only purpose behind all these is to establish peace again.
The world has seen the destruction of the world in the First World War.
According to estimation approximately one crore soldiers , other crore people lost their lives .
Therefore how important peace is the world .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
These are not only peace , goodwill i . . war .
Change in the environment from acuteness to environment , economic development has to change social judgment .
The truth is the true signal of the development of the person .
My favorite country , our north-eastern states are different .
The natural beauty of this place is unparalleled and the people here are extremely immense.
This award is similar to Oscar in that field, which is given for the best policing in this field.
Besides this our Sikkim has spent this archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologists from twenty five countries .
This is why I am telling many people of Sikkim .
My favorite country has become October .
There are many changes in the weather also .
Along with this the atmosphere of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepawali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say that the month of November is the month of festivals .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many ruins often .
I want all of you to keep in mind your health besides your peace in these festivals .
To make new decisions also these festivals give opportunity .
With a mission mode, I want these festivals to become an opportunity for you to move forward in your life and make a strong resolve.
Your development is an important part of the country's development.
If you have developed so much that the country will progress as much .
All of you are my best wishes .
