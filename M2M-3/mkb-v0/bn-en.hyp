Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Many congratulations to all of you on Deepawali and we have been told here - Shubham Karoti Kalyanang Arogyang Dhan Sampadam.
Deepjyotrinmastu in the Shatrbuddhi diagnosis.
How beautiful a message.
At present, Deepawali is celebrated in different countries of the world.
Not only Indians participate in this festival, but also the governments of many countries, citizens and social organisations of that country celebrate the festival of Diwali with joy.
In a way, India is built there.
Friends, Festivals on the world have a different attraction for tourism.
Our India is a country of festivals, there is a huge opportunity for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi or Deepawali or Onam or Pongal or Bihu, we should try to promote all these festivals and also join the people of other states and other countries in this happiness.
We have such festivals in every state, in every region and in every region, the people of other countries are interested in this festival.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important for the promotion of tourism festivals in India.
My dear countrymen, during the last Mann Ki Baat, I have decided to do something different on this occasion of Diwali.
I had said that let us all celebrate the strength of Indian women and their success in this Deepawali, that is, India respects Lakshmi.
Immediately after seeing this, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the social media.
Worrengle's Kodipaka Ramesh, Namo App wrote: My mother is my power.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we are five brothers in a good biography.
My mother is my God.
Everything I see, he is Lakshmi of India, the Prime Minister said.
Rameshji, I salute your mother.
In a tour, a very active singer lyricist was told by Maj Khushbu Kuar Bharati Lakshmi, the daughter of Bus Conductor, who led the women's army of Assam Rifles.
Her daughter is Lakshmi of India, who has the strength of poet Tiwariji.
He is proud that his daughter has taken a very good picture, and took a very good place in the clutches test.
Meghala Jain wrote: A 92-year-old woman has been donating water to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station for several years.
Meghalaji, India is very inspired by the humble nature and compassion of Lakshmi.
People shared many such stories.
You must read, take inspiration and share some things around yourself.
I salute all these Lakshmis of India.
My dear countrymen, Sachi Honnama, the famous woman poet of the 17th century, had written a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same idea, the words of India, those Lakshmis whom we are talking about, it seems that they had chosen it in the seventeenth century.
The beauty of the words, the beauty of the words, the beauty of the words, and the poems of the Kannada language - Peninda Permegandanu Himavaantunu, Peninda Bhrigu Perchidanupeninda Janakrayanu Jabdenunu, that is, Himavaantantu i.e. Parvatraj is famous for his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bharigu for his daughter Lakshmi and Janak for his daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future of our society through our pride and great work of these girls.
My dear countrymen, this day on 12th November, 2019, the 550th Annual Festival of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is spread not only in India but also in the world.
In many countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters who have dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can't forget about my visit to Venkuver and Tehran.
There are many things about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can share with you, but for this, there will be a lot of festivals of Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service work at the top of all.
Guru Nanak Devji believed that the service of selflessness was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, his message has reached the world far and wide.
He was one of the most visitors of his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won the hearts of everyone through his salvation, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has travelled to several important religious places.
It is said that Sadhu and Shankardev of Assam are also inspired by his ideals.
He also traveled to the holy land of Haridar.
During his farewell visit to Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev Ji had solved the water problems there.
Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, who is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji, is a famous place called Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, which reminds us of him.
During a despair, Guru Nanak ji had travelled north Kashmir and its surroundings.
It established a strong relationship between Sikh religion followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji had also gone to Tibet and he was also accepted as a Guru.
He also traveled to Uzbekistan and he was also worshipped there.
And in a desperate time, he travelled widely to the Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Afghanistan.
He lived in the hearts of lakhs of people, who followed his teachings with full respect and are still doing it today.
And this journey was organised to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all those ambassadors, along with the Golden Temple philosophy, have the opportunity to know about Sikh heritage and culture.
He was a great hero who integrated the country with unity.
Just as Sardar Patel had a wonderful capacity to unite people, he was able to coordinate with those who used to see an interpretational difference.
Sardar Patel used to closely monitor and examine microscope matters.
In this regard, he was the Man of Detail.
He was also a part of the organizational skills.
He was particularly transparent in planning and planning skills.
When we read or hear about Sardar Saheb's practices, we can know how excellent Orplaning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country attended the Ahmedabad session.
He ensured that no one suffers from water.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to create khadi bags.
Look again, for this, the sale of khadi has increased a lot.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution Council.
He has done an important task to ensure our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of discriminating on the basis of caste or community.
Friends, We all know that as the first Heritage Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the historical and important work of uniting the ruins and regions of this country.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a special feature that he had an eye on all sides.
On the one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
Likewise Lakshadweep and his goals of far south did not go away .
In fact, when we mention Sardar Patel's efforts, we talk about his role in some specific parts of the country.
Like Lakshadweep even for a small area he played an important role .
Immediately after receiving this news, without delay, Sardar Patel immediately took stringent steps.
He sent instructions to the brother-in-law of Mudalia , Arcot Ramswamy Mudaliar and Arcot Laxmanswamy Mudaliar that he immediately hoisted the national flag along with the trekkers .
According to his instructions the swimming was done immediately and the neighbourhood of the neighbourhood on Lakshadweep was defeated.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudalia that he should ensure that all support is available in the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing very important in the progress of India.
This is an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you will visit this beautiful island and their seashore.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2018, the Statue of Unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the whole country and to the world.
This is the longest human statue in the world.
In 1960, it doubles the Statue of Liberty of America.
The longest statue of the world fills the heart of every Indian with pride -LRB- in the form of Indian heart gets filled with pride when it feels that the longest statue of the world is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian ' s head rises in self-confidence.
You will be happy to know that in a year only 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity statue .
That is, every day about eight and a half thousand people have enjoyed the pride of this Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the faith that he has in his heart , that respect has been expressed .
Now there are several attraction centres like catastrophe gardens, butterflies gardens, jungle safari, child nutrition parks, Ekta nursery etc.
Professional training is being provided for hostels or housing facilities.
Local people have now started farming of dragon fruits and I am confident that this will become the main source of their livelihood .
Friends, This Statue of Unity can be a matter of study for the country, for every state, for the tourism industry.
How can we witness how one place become a world famous tourist center in a year itself , where people of the country and abroad are coming .
Traffic systems, accommodation places, presence of guides, environment-friendly arrangements - each one is getting better.
Very big economic growth has started and local people are innovating services as required for the tourists .
The government is fulfilling its own liability.
Friends , there are no Indians who will not be proud to know that some days ago the Time Journal has placed this Statue of Unity in the best tourist spots of the world .
I hope all of you will go to see this Statue of Unity by taking some space out of your valuable time , but I am solitary that every Indian who leaves for a tour , he goes to at least fifteen destinations of the country in family and stays there night .
Friends, You know that from 2014 every year 31st October is being celebrated as the National Integration Day.
This is a message to maintain the unity, integrity and security of our country at any cost.
Even today, Run for Unity is being organized.
This will include all sections of the society.
Running is beneficial for both mind and body.
I hope that all of you will participate in the race on 31st October - for the unity of the country and to keep your body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country to unity.
This mantra of unity is a transformation of our lives and we must strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been active and alert to strengthen the unity and concern of the country.
There will be many such examples around us who are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their words are very quickly mixed with our memory.
Friends, I remember that the month of September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court gave the verdict on the birthplace of Ram.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the former Prime Minister of our country, Smt. Indira Devi was also killed on this day.
My dear countrymen, if there is a story in every household, every village, from east to west, from north to south, from every corner of India, then it is a cleanliness.
I want to tell every individual, every family and every village my pleasant experience of cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of 100 crore Indians.
Therefore, the benefits of this scheme are 100 million Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I heard you and I want to hear you too.
In such a difficult situation, being in such a complication is not less bravery.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only safeguarding the borders of the country, but are also running a clean Siachen campaign.
There's so cold that nothing melts.
In such a situation, separation of waste is an important task.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier which is a source of rivers and pure water.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at one place ensuring clean water for those who live in the lower areas, and utilising river water like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival that creates a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, some or the other new shopping, some of the markets, some of them are brought to the households.
I once said we tried to buy local things.
If we get the things we need, we don't need to go to funds.
If you get the funds, you don't need to go to the district.
The more we try to buy local things, the more Gandhi will turn you into a great festival.
And I always urge that we should buy something or the other made by our khadi workers.
In this Deepawali, many people have bought a lot before Deepawali, but there are many people who think that after Deepawali, things may be affordable.
So there will be a lot of people who are still left to buy.
So, I would like to request you to come and seek local reasons, whether local things or not.
Look, we can also play an important role in fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Diwali.
Like everyone in Deepawali, we use betels.
But sometimes there's a fire due to carelessness.
Sometimes wounded.
I urge all of you to be cautious and celebrate the festival with great fervor.
My best wishes, Royal.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Is there any Indian who is not proud of our armed forces, our soldiers
Yesterday, 125 crore people of the country celebrated Parakram Parv.
We remember that in 2016, the incident of Surgical Strike, when our soldiers gave a strong answer to the people who were showing in the name of Praxy Ware in the backdrop of terrorism.
Our armed forces organized exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lion part of the people, especially the younger generation of the country can feel our strengths, how capable we are, and how our soldiers can protect our countrymen by harming their lives.
On the occasion of Parakram Parva, our Armed Forces have a glorious heritage to the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also took part in a programme of brave warriors in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is sure that our soldiers will give a sufficient answer to all those who want to destroy the peace and well-being environment of our country.
But, with respect, and not with respect to the sovereign powers of the country.
India is always committed and committed to maintaining peace and security.
During the two-two wars of the 19th century, more than one lakh soldiers sacrificed their lives for peace, this event was the war with which we had no connection.
Our vision never fell on the land of any other country.
This was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on 23rd September, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lansar, who had freed Haifa from the attackers on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa war in Israel.
This was also a valour of our soldiers for peacekeeping.
Even today, India is one of the highest number of armed forces in the United Nations.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in the entire world's peace system by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, our air power is unparalleled.
During the Republic Day celebrations, the most interested part of the cottage is the Fly Past, where our Air Force has a glimpse of unprecedented artwork and energy.
On 8th October, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1994, when the Pakistani invaders started an alarming attack, the Air Force ensured that the Indian Army and the warships reached the battlefield at the right time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in the war of 1985.
Who doesn't know about the 1991s of Bangladesh
The Air Force played a very important role in relieving Kargil from the inventors in 1999.
At Tiger Hill, the Air Force was breastfeeding on the enemy's valley by continuously bombing them.
Whether it is relief and rescue operations or emergency arrangements, the entire country is grateful to them for the important role of the Air Force.
The contribution of the Air Force in combating natural calamities such as storms, storms, floods or terrible destruction is exemplary.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring equality of gender equality in the country and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is giving the opportunity to select the option of the Permanent Commission along with the short service commission of women, which I announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 15th of August this year.
India can say with pride that the Indian Armed Forces have not only male power but the contribution of women power is also increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave, brave and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash was the first Indian who was traveling the world with a small boat without any modern technology.
Over 80 days, the Indian Ocean participated in the Golden Global Race competition in the South of the Ocean, and was at a rapid pace.
I told me the pledge to do something like this adventure...
I pray for Abhilash Tomy's rapid health and hope that his courage, heroism, this determination - the power to win this fight - will inspire and inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, children also know what is the significance of the 2nd October day.
This year, this day has a special significance.
For the next two years, we are going to celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in the world.
The consciousness and consciousness of Mahatma Gandhi has reached the world today.
Everyone like Dr. Mart Luthar King Mandela or Nelson Mandela has gained strength from the spirit of Gandhiji, who has fought a long time to achieve equal rights and dignity of the people.
In todays Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss with you another important task of revered Bapuji, which all the people of the country need to know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as Constructive Programme or Constructive Programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle became strong in 1985, Gandhiji made a revised copy of these ideas.
Revered Bapu ji highlighted his thoughts about the rights of the farmers, the people of the village, the rights of the labourers and the welfare of the labourers and the spread of cleanliness and education, which is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapuji was a public coordinator.
Bapuji's characteristic of mixing with human beings and adopting human beings was his nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He had conveyed to the people that they are important and essential for the development of the country.
He gave this achievement the form of an universal mass movement which was his best contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society dedicated themselves to Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra, which we know as Gandhiji's magic.
Gandhiji had said there, "I am telling you about such a strategy, remember my thoughts whenever there is a doubt or arrogance in your mind.
Remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in your life and question your mind how useful it will be for that person.
That is, will crores of hungry and hungry people achieve self-respect
That's why you'll see your suspicion and the arrogance turned out.
My dear countrymen, a strategy of Gandhiji is still a similar significance.
The economic energy and purchasing capabilities of the growing middle class of the country are today elevated.
If that benefit reaches the poor, then my happiness will increase manifold.
Keeping this in mind the strategies of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that whenever we buy something, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must keep in mind that every countrymen of our buying is good and those who have sweated in the products, those who have invested in their talents, they should get some benefit to everybody.
This is Gandhiji's strategy, this is Gandhiji's message and I believe that a small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we might think that through these small tasks, we can contribute to the economic progress of our country, to the economic empowerment of our country, to the power of fighting the poor against poverty.
And I believe that this is the real patriot of today's era, this is a tribute to the work of revered Bapu.
Think of buying khadi and handicrafts products on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji with revered Bapu.
As the name of Shastriji is highlighted, we have an infinite respect in the minds of our people.
His compassionate personality always fills the hearts of every countrymen.
The speciality of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he was very soft from outside, but he was firm in his heart.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the indicator of his great personality.
During the last one and a half years, he has given a mantra to reach the success of the youth and farmers of the country, which is a result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
I am also fortunate to donate sanitation work with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school, whose foundation stone was laid by the revered Baba Saheb himself.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate Affairs all have donated sanitation labour to the larger people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachhta lovers of the country for this.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I especially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in the country but also in the world.
This time, India is organizing the worlds largest Sanitation Convention - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials from all over the world from the Ministry of Cleanliness and experts from all over the world will come and share their experiences and experiences on sanitation.
It is essential to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the exploited, afflicted and deprived people.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1982.
Within a few days, the NHRC will complete 50 years.
The NHRC has not only protected human rights but also helped in enhancing spiritual pride.
Our favourite leader, former Prime Minister Prayat Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly said that human rights are not a foreign idea for us.
Our National Human Rights Commission symbolizes the ideal policy of the Vedic era, "All Bhawantu Sukhin:".
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing misuse.
The Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and faith among the people of the country.
I think it is very optimistic for a healthy society, for democratic values.
Now, 26 State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs) have been set up at the national level.
All these great men have inspired us, we salute them.
Come this year too, we are trying to organise Run for Unity in our villages, in Ganj, in the city, in the metropolis.
Run for Unity is the right way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country forever.
I urge all of you to strengthen this effort to bind every society and every individual in the form of unity through the Run for Unity on 31st October and that will be the best tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you for these holy festivals.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan festival.
I extend my best wishes to all the people on this auspicious occasion.
This festival of Rakhibandhan is a symbol of the love and belief of sisters and brothers.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many such incidents in the history of the country, when one has seen how the two states, or the people of different religions have been bonded with faith.
Janmashtami a few days later.
Hathi Ghose Pal Ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki and Govinda will be heard in the air.
It's a different joy to feed yourself with the color of Krishna.
In different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, Dahi-Handi is also being organised.
I am grateful to Chinmayi that he has taken care of this.
Friends, Besides Rakhibandhan, Shravan Purnima is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those who have been involved in preserving this great heritage, taking it forward and delivering it to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a huge repository of knowledge that works in every field of life in Sanskrit language and literature.
Whether it is science or system knowledge, agriculture or health, architecture or architecture, nucleus or management, economics or environment, the mantra of fighting with challenges like global warming is also described in detail.
You all will be happy to know that all the people of Mattur village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit language as a medium of dialogue today.
You will be surprised to know one thing that Sanskrit is a language in which it is possible to create an infinite word.
We use English cotton, sometimes poetry, etc.
But those who are associated with the words of Sanskrit, know how little the correct description of the matter can be done through these defined words of Sanskrit.
It means that if a Guru gives a letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or wealth all over the world, through which the disciple can repay the debt of the Guru.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always remember the great teacher and the former President of India, Bharat Ratna Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day is celebrated across the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and remember his dedication to science, education and students with respect.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and sisters who work hard bring rains a happy news.
Many days ago, we have seen how a severe flood has disturbed the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country has come to Kerala.
I convey my deep condolences to those families who have lost their loved ones in this disaster.
But I would like to assure all those families who have lost their lives that 125 crore people shoulder to shoulder shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity recover quickly.
I am confident that the life of Kerala will become easier by filling the indomitable life force and courage.
The way disaster destroys public life is very unfortunate, but in this unfortunate day, we regain the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody is trying his best so that the people of the regions where disasters are terrible, whether it is Kerala or any district or region of India can enjoy their lives.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their help.
Everybody thinks how people of Kerala can share their sorrows and sufferings so that they can be reduced.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the hero of this disaster rescue operation in Kerala.
They have taken all the ways to save the flooded people.
Air Force, Navy or Army, BS-F, CI-SF, R-A-F etc.
I would like to particularly mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in dealing with these disasters, they are commendable.
The power of NDR-F, their commitment, their ability to bring the situation to the forefront by taking a fast decision has created a sacred seat in the minds of all the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, while reading the suggestions sent for Mann Ki Baat this time, the most people have written about it is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
From Ghaziabad to Kirti, Swati Vash from Sonepat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and many others have urged me to speak on various aspects of Atal ji's life in the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
On 16th August, the people of the country and the world have received the news of Atal ji's demise and expressed deep condolences.
He is a nation leader who has sacrificed the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and has gone far away from active politics in the last ten years.
He couldn't have seen special news.
The affection, devotion and condolence of all for Atal ji is an indicator of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing Good Governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to tell you about one more example of Atal ji's great personality: this is the political culture that he has depicted, the changes that he has made in the political culture and the efforts made to provide a well-organized infrastructure to the political culture will make the country sure that there will be a lot of benefits in the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the Amendment Act, 2003.
This amendment brings two significant changes in our country's politics.
Firstly, the Ministerial Council of States has been limited to 15 of the total seats of the Legislative Assembly.
Atal ji has brought about a change in this system, resulting in savings of funds and resources, improving efficiency.
Atal ji was the only visionary who brought about a change in the situation and embraced a healthy and healthy system in politics.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
Atal ji presented the budget in 2001 instead of five o'clock in the afternoon.
One more freedom we have achieved during Atal ji's tenure through creation of Indian Flag Code.
It is enforced since 2002, which enables tricolor excitement at public places.
Ordinary Indians get the opportunity to hoist the national flag.
In this way, he brought our beloved tricolor to the public.
You have seen how Atal ji has brought about a change in the voting process and has strengthened the country's mind by taking brave steps in the election of the people.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion about the Parliament today, there is a obstacle and a hurricane, but whenever there is a good thing, there is no special discussion.
A few days ago, the Parliament session concluded.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
All the Parliamentarians have tried to utilize the maximum number of Houses of Parliament by abandoning the party's interests, resulting in the passage of Lok Sabha 21 T and Rajya Sabha 14 Bills.
This session of Parliament will be memorable for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of important bills have been passed for the betterment of youth and backward classes.
You all know that for decades, OBC commissions like the SCST Commission have been set up.
In order to ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution of the OBC Commission this time and has given this institution a constitutional right.
These steps will help in successfully pursuing the objective of social justice.
The session also commenced the passage of the Amended Bill to enhance the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of SCs and STs.
It will also protect the criminals from their atrocities and enhance their faith.
There is no harmony in the country's society.
The criminals will be punished for at least 10 years and if they kill less than 12 years of age, they will be punished.
A few days ago, you might have read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh has heard two convicts of hanging on the crime of killing a girl after just two months of hearing.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh punished the criminals after just five days of hearing.
A Rajasthan court has also given such a rapid judgement.
The law will play a constructive role in resolving crimes against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
Though the three Talaq Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, although it was not possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women and the entire country with all the strength to provide justice to them.
When we come forward to protect the interest of the country, it is possible to bring about a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
In this season, all of you have set up an ideal together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, this moment, the Asian Federation is committed to the vision of millions of people in Jakarta.
Every morning, the Indian sportsperson has won the medals in newspapers, television, news and social media.
Asian Games are still going on.
I congratulate all those who have won the medal for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who are still left in the competition.
India's sportspersons, especially shooting and wrestling, are performing well, in all the games that we have not been able to do well before, our sportspersons are bringing medals like Wushu and Rowing.
These are not medals, it is a testimony to the courage of Indian sports and Indian competitors and their dreams.
The number of our girls in the list of medal winners for the country is a positive one.
Many of the youngsters who have won the medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won the medals have emerged from a well-known village and offswell and have achieved this success with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate the National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sports lovers and also pay homage to the great sportsperson of Haki.
My urge to all citizens of the country to sports and focus on your fitness because a healthy India will build a prosperous and prosperous India.
When India is fit then India will build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and also wish the rest of the sportspersons the best results.
But the Brihadeshwar Temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is a place where this unforgettable mixture of architecture and engineering is seen.
Everybody was surprised to see the queen of the eleventh century in Patna in Gujarat.
Labs of engineering are always in India.
There are many engineers born in India who have imagined imaginable and have made examples in the engineering world.
Our great engineers have a jewellery in their heritage, whose work still surprises the people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
He remembered the rest of the people of the country with great respect and respect.
In his memory, 15th September was born as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their independent identity in the eastern world.
When I talk about the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world, I remember one of the most terrible earthquakes of Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
He was funny looking at me, look at my house.
Kutch is called Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was very proud to say this thing, and I remember that many years ago, our engineers used to build houses by conducting local environment and conditions, so that people were safe.
Now when we celebrate Engineers Day, we have to think of the future, we have to organize workshops at different places.
Would we have to learn new things when we have to think
Do you have to learn
The world is fighting with natural calamities.
What will be the new use of structural engineering here
What's his course
What should the students teach
I convey my best wishes to all of you for this idea.
We'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
It has inspired people's thinking.
You must have seen on TV that a group of 12 young football players in Thailand and their coaches went to a cave.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But on that day Bhagyadevi had a different desire.
When they entered the cave, due to heavy rains, there is a lot of water accumulated in the mouth of the cave.
All efforts are made to know where those boys are, how they are, how they can be brought out.
But I want to see this whole incident in a different way.
The government, the parents of the children, the people of the family, the media and the citizens of the country have shown each one of the best practices of peace and patience.
All teams have joined this mission.
I think it's a matter of learning and self-reliance.
Parents didn't feel sorry or mother didn't throw water in the eyes but not.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the peaceful use of the entire society is indeed academic for us.
In this operation, a Thailand naval soldier had to die.
The entire world is surprised that despite such a terrible situation, the rescuers have worked with courage and patience in the deserted dark cave.
This incident shows that when people are united, there are many wonderful things.
It is important that we focus on ourselves in a calm mind and keep working for it.
A few days ago, our country's popular poet Neeraj passed away.
The speciality of poet Neeraj was hope, trust, determination and confidence.
The poet Neeraj can inspire all our Indians.
He wrote: The darkness will be removed as much as the storms will emerge, the darkness will eradicate when the vajrapata Hokdeep is burnt and I pay homage to poet Neeraj.
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when the Peak Session for the colleges.
Like truth, millions of youngsters go out of school and go to college.
The months of February and March are scheduled to enjoy the holidays of April and May, as well as to make results, future lifestyles and career choices.
July is the month when youngsters move in a new way of their lives, when the focus moves away from Kochhen to Kat-off.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of Professors from the umbrella of Parents.
I believe my young friends are very excited and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, we have to go out of the house, go out of the village, get out of a safe environment and guide ourselves.
All these youngsters left their homes and took their lives forward in a new way.
There is no way to study, but we have to go on looking for new things.
Old friends are very precious.
The youngsters who have gone out of their homes to study somewhere else should discover that place and know about the people, languages and culture there.
I convey my best wishes to all the youngsters.
Her father has been supplied to the family by cutting the waste of Astakude.
I congratulate Ashram for this success in that situation.
There are so many distressed family students who have shown their hard work and concentration in every situation that inspires all of us.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father's D-TC busman or Kolkata's Abhay Gupta, who studied under the light of the footpath of the road. Among them are the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afreen Sheikh, whose father Auto Challan, the daughter of a school driver of Nagpur, Khushi, daughter of a school driver, Kartik, son of a chowkidar of Haryana, or Ramesh Sahu, son of a brick-brick labourer in Jharkhand.
Anushka Panda, a victim of hereditary disease called Spiinal Mascular Autopsy, who is a victim of hereditary illness in Gurgaon, has achieved the success of showing the world by obstacles and obstacles in their determination and minds.
We will find such examples when we look around us.
Any good event in any part of the country gives strength to my mind and inspires me.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I saw a news in which it was written: "Modi's dream was fulfilled by two young people.
After reading the inner news, I came to know how our youth is trying to transform the lives of the common man through technology smart and creative uses.
Once in the city of 'Technology Hub' San Jose, America, I had requested the Indian youth to think of how they can use their talents for India and take time out.
I had requested the brain drain to be converted into brain gene.
Two IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have made an innovative effort by acknowledging this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have made a smart village app using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the village to the world but will now get any information or news on their mobile.
The App provides telephone directory, News section, events list, health centers, information centers etc.
The App is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate among the farmers is working to sell their products from one hand.
Thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, the punya Yatra of Puntarpur is a wonderful festival.
Friends, Akashmi of the eighteenth month which was on 23rd July this year, the pilgrimage of Puntarpur was celebrated with joy.
Puntarpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
Sages like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were dancing in the name of Lord Bitthal in the palanquin.
Bhagwan Bithal, who is also called Bithoba or Pandurang, devotees reach there for his philosophy.
Lord Bithal defended the interests of the poor, the helpless, the victims.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion to God.
You go to Bithoba Temple in Puntarpur, there is a different experience of the importance, beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat, if there is an opportunity, you will certainly get the experience of pilgrimage of Puntarpur.
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, such innumerable saints are still teaching the common man in Maharashtra.
The world like 'Varood' or 'Awang' has been guided by them for goodwill, love and brotherhood.
We can fight with respect to the blind faith, this mantra is from them.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the old evils are removed from the society and have brought the feelings of compassion, equality and goodness among the people.
Just like this was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who made a deep impression in the minds of many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confidence.
He had the power and intellect to show the misconception of the British rulers.
The British used to fear Lokmanya Tilak so much that in twenty years, three or three times he had received complaints of treason against him.
I am telling you about a special event about Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, I think 100 years ago, more than 40 thousand people joined him to welcome him.
The Mayor of the City Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel, decided to set up a memorial of His Majesty Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Usually the British rulers were extremely dissatisfied and the collector used to repeated the proposal to build a memorial called 'Smaru Hella'.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, he will leave the post but he will leave the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, inviting Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate the statue by constructing Sardar Patel statue on 28 February 1929.
At the inauguration ceremony, the revered Bapu said that just one person was not found as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Council, he got such a power that made the statue of Tilak possible.
My dear countrymen, one of the features of this statue that was established by Sardar Patel is that Lokmanya Tilak ji is seated in the chair and is written below this statue, 'Swaraj is my birth rights'.
To the English, this writing started listening to God's direction.
The first public Ganesh Festival was celebrated with the help of Lokmanya Tilak.
The Ganesh Festival, traditionally enriched with respect and honour, has become an effective medium for social awakening, unity, harmony and harmony.
Ganesh Mandap can be seen in the streets in any city.
All the families of the streets meet the Ganesh Festival.
This is an extraordinary opportunity for our youth, which can enable them to achieve special capabilities like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have also said last time that I would like to recall Lokmanya Tilak ji, even today you should celebrate the Ganesh Festival with great fanfare but celebrate the festival Parivash Bandhav.
Ganesh ji's decoration and prayer materials are all environmental.
Those who dedicated their lives so that the people of the country can breathe in a free India.
I'm talking to Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are no youngsters in India who will not be inspired by listening to this line: Sarforshi Ki Tamna of Hammer in the heart of Hai Hai Hai Hai Joor Kitana Baju-e-Katil Mai Hai, the lines of this poetry are inspired by Tejis like Ashfaq Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads bravery and impatience for freedom have inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived his life but never sweetened his head in front of foreign rule.
It is my privilege to visit Chandrashekhar Azad village of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I bow down to two great sons of Mother India, Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, India's brave daughter Kisankanya Hima Das won the gold medal at a 400m race in the 20th World Athletics event in Finland.
A daughter of the country, Ekta Bhawan, e-mailed me from Indonesia in my letter, is now preparing for the Asian Federation there.
E-mail is writing solidarity. Any athlete's life is Mahendra's time when he swimms and I am proud that I have done it.
Unity, all of us are proud of you.
His success is significant because he has made his challenge a means of success.
In 2003, in the road accident, unity becomes the lower part of the terrible body, but this girl did not lose courage and strengthened herself and reached her own goal.
I salute Ekta Bhawan ji, Yogesh Katuniya ji, Sunder Singh ji for his courage and warrior mood.
You go ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, many events of the history of August are full of festivals, but sometimes diseases also enter home due to weather.
I convey my best wishes for the good health of all of you, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for the centuries of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat will meet again.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again I am fortunate to be faced with you all at the Mann Ki Baat event.
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket match in Bangalore.
You may have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was the first international test match of Afghanistan, and it is a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides showcased excellent sports capabilities in this match.
And I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shri Ashrafgani, had tagged me and wrote in his tweet: People of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
Rashid represents the best of Afghanistan.
He wrote a wealth in the world of cricket, and with a little fun, "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match will be remembered for all of us.
Though this was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I'll remember this match for another thing.
The Indian team has done a job that is unprecedented all over the world.
At the time of taking the Indian team, a winner has done the same thing as a team.
At the time of taking the Indian team, the Afghan team, who is playing international matches for the first time, invites and photographs together.
What can happen to sportsman spirit and sportsmanship
The best way to unite sports society and find out the talent that our youngsters have.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan
My dear countrymen, on June 21, this fourth Yoga Day has seen a wonderful scene.
Be it the Brussels-European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters located in New York, the Japanese Navy's fighter ships, people are doing yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga has been organised and I am told that many seats have been demonstrated by women.
In Ladakh, the Indian and Chinese soldiers have done yoga together at the peaks of the snow.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with such enthusiasm, then why will it not be very much enthusiastic in India
Our warriors of the Air Force have pillared everybody with Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
There was a spectacular scene, they didn't sit in the flight, they were swimming in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, Yoga has been done everywhere.
A view of Ahmedabad was enchanting, where around 750 daily disabled brothers and sisters have created a record by doing yoga at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
Wellness's efforts are being made through yoga, I hope that it will move forward.
Gradually many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone.
You know, Kabirdasjiken went to Imgahar
He is the one who can understand the sorrows of others.
He who doesn't understand the sufferings of others, he's desperate.
Kabir Das ji gave special emphasis on social coordination.
"Jagme Barry Koi Nehi, Joe heart is cold.
Ih, papa, give me pulses, please everywhere.
Kabir Das ji said, "Yes, compassionately is the religion, where love is the sin.
His invaluable words spread the same effect even after this time. Now when we are talking about Saint Kabir Das Ji, he remembers a blame.
This is the greatness of the Guru and one such guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have guided millions of people to the truth, who have been inspiring people for the time being.
The 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanakdev Ji will be celebrated in 2019.
It is a history that is associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh, which is going to be completed 100 years, was that which embarrassed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, someone had forgotten the black day when firing on innocent, unarmed and innocent people crossing all the boundaries of inequality by using energy.
This tragic event is going to be completed 100 years but we will always remember the message that this incident has conveyed, that is, there can never be any solution between violence and jealousy.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always win.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2018.
Ramanji, first of all, thank you very much.
It is very good to see your interest in India's history.
You know, Dr.
Perhaps very few people know that Dr.
At the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore spoke in Bengali language at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
This was the first example when during the British rule, a person spoke in Bengali language at the Convocation of the University of Kolkata.
From 1997 to 1997, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's first Industrial Minister and in a sense, India's entrepreneurship and holistic foundation for India's progress was laid by him on a strong foundation and platform.
In 1985, the first industrial policy of independent India was based on its plans and vision.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream was that India will be self-sufficient, better and prosperous in every field of industry.
He wanted India to become a big industry and also to take full care of MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
In order to enhance cottage industry and small scale industries, he read the finance and organisation setups, due to which All II will be set up between 1980 and 1980.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the progress of West Bengal.
His thoughts, consciousness and activity have saved a part of West Bengal and is still part of India.
Come, let us remember the message of this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and continue to take India forward through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the last few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to those people who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I got the opportunity to get away from the files and listen directly from the faces of the people.
People have said their resolves, their happiness and sorrows, their achievements.
I think this was not just a government event, but it was another kind of learning experience and what could be more satisfactory than the joy I have seen in the eyes of the people at this time
When a common man used to listen to his simple words, his simple words, his reading and his feelings, he used to touch his heart.
I knew how the girls from remote villages have been helping the Common Service Centre to create passports for the elderly and the elderly from the pension to the common man.
In Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are running Jan Aushadhi as well as providing affordable medicines to the surrounding villages.
The youngsters who were looking for jobs in West Bengal two or three years ago, now they are not only running their business with success but also employing 10-15 people with their food.
On the other hand, students from schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues like West Management at the Tinkering Lab at this short age.
There was a story of such innumerable experiences and there was no place where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that I have felt the strength of the success of the common man from the success of the government, the strength of the country and the tenth, the strength of the dream of a New India, the strength of the resolution.
There are some people in the society, unless they talk about despair, do not talk about despair, do not create unbelief, do not find ways to break, they do not get peace.
In such an environment, when the common man speaks of new hopes and new zeals, his success is not the government but his achievement.
The story of a small girl from a remote village also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people have joined this video bridge and have given me a new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I have also felt this aroma of goodness.
In fact, the Corporate Professionals of Bangalore, IT engineers have together created a 'Shaj Samridhi Trust' and have activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, they have been associated with the farmers, schemes have been created and how to increase the income of the farmers, they have been making a positive effort.
How to biological farming can be done with new methods of farming and how to produce one crop along with other crops, all these trainings are being provided to the farmers and technologists through this trust.
Earlier, all the farmers who were dependent on only one crop, so that the crops were not good and the benefits were not even good. Today they are not only flourishing many crops but they are making good profits by making proper marketing of crops through this trust.
Crops will be good only when good species of seeds are used, seed banks have been made separately for this purpose.
Women work for seed bank maintenance and women have also been associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST is going to be completed.
Today, the dream of One Nation One Tax was realized.
"One Nation One Tax Reform" if I have to give credit to anyone for this system, then I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a beautiful example of co-operative federalism, where all the states have decided to take the country's welfare together and as a result, such a big tax reform system has been introduced in the country.
So far, the 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can be proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken unanimously, despite different political thinking persons, different states and representatives of different priorities.
There were 17 different types of taxes in the country before the GST but after the introduction of this system, the same tax system is now in the country.
The cheque posts have also been closed after the arrival of GST, which has resulted in pace of transportation of goods and other goods, not only saved time but also in the logistics sectors.
GST is probably the world's largest tax reform system.
In India, such a big tax reform has been successful because the people of the country have adopted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is usually believed that such a large size reform takes 5 to 7 years to be implemented properly in such a large country with such a large population.
But the zeal of the true nation, the flow of the honesty festival of the country and the participation of the people's power is that in a year, this new tax system has created its place, it has been established and it has been reviving itself through a necessary inbuilt system.
This is a great success that 125 crore Indians have achieved.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember that a team of six women commanders of the Navy has been traveling for the past few months.
I would like to say something about the name of Navika Sagar Parikrama.
The six daughters of India have returned to India on May 21, 2018 through INSV Tarini for more than 250 days and welcomed them all over the world.
Around 22,000 natical distances have been covered by various oceans and some sea travels.
This is an unprecedented event all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the navy reputation, for enhancing Indias honour, especially for the daughters of India, for delivering this message to the world court.
You must have seen that in the last few days, new information about Mount Everest-Jai people has been found.
On 16th May, five tribal students from an Ashram-Vidyalaya of Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhubai, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Swam, won the world's highest horn.
They started training in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh from August 2017.
They were selected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning Everest with the meaning of the name, they brightened the country's name.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, Sivangi Pathak, 16, has won Everest as the youngest Indian woman in Nepal.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Diya Everest won the first father-daughter jute.
Not only is the youth winning Everest, but Smt. Sangeeta Behel also won Everest on 19th May.
There are some of the Everest climbers who are not only skilled, emotional.
This work is not only commendable but also indicates their responsibility towards cleanliness and environment.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave brave men, especially to the daughters.
A number of people from different sectors will come forward to support this matter.
In the context of Fit I India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
In social media, people are sharing their fitness challenges and tagging others and challenging them.
I believe this is a very good process and such challenges encourage us to fit ourselves and fit others.
My dear countrymen, many times you have heard from me about sports and sportspersons in Mann Ki Baat.
Chhobi Yadavji, thank you very much for your phone
These games were a special part of summer holidays.
There are two traditional sports practices.
Outdoor is also there and there is Indo.
The unity of our country's diversity may be seen in these sports.
The same game is known as different places.
It plays on the Square Board of 8th and 8th with a buffalo or a buffalo.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dayam Thayam in Tamil Nadu and Changapo in Rajasthan.
Even if the people of different states don't know each other's language, they look at the time of playing.
It's a game that can be seen everywhere in rural and urban areas.
They are also known in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibila or Karavilla.
In Odisha, it is called shooting, in Maharashtra, it is said to be Bittidalu.
Traditional sports are such that along with physical capabilities, our logical thinking, concentration, awakening and enhancing swiftness.
And these are not just sports, they teach the values of our life, to determine the goals of learning, to achieve determination, to create team spirits, to help each other.
Just a few days ago, I saw that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of Business Management to improve the inclusive personality and inter-personal skills.
At the same time, we are also aware of our culture and tradition.
Some sports make us aware about society, environment etc.
Now it is necessary for the school, school and youth to encourage these games.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can build a museum of our heritage sports.
This game can be made video so that the rules of sports can be shown how to play.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generation can know about these games, play and grow up and my dear countrymen.
This is the theme Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge you all to understand the importance of this thinking and ensure that we do not use polythene, low grade plastic and try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic polyushan on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge you to try to use it in your daily life by looking at all the information from the World Environment Day website Wedindia 2018.
The loss of lives, wealth damaged.
All these are the results of the changes in the Weather Pattern.
Mahatma Gandhi has said this for his life.
Today, India is talking about Climate Justice, COP 21 and Paris Agreement, we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance, and we are working auspiciously to fulfil the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this environment day, we think that what can we do to make this world cleaner and greener
How can we move forward on this path, what innovation can we do
It's raining.
Now we can plant a record number of trees, not only planting but it is also important to take care of it till the trees grow.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You all remember the 21st June, not just you and me, the whole world remembers June 21st.
The International Day of Yoga is celebrated on 21st June in the world and it is unanimously acknowledged that a few months ago, the event's preparation begins.
It is reported that the world is preparing to celebrate June 21 as International Day of Yoga.
Yoga increases courage, which always protects us like a child.
Forgiveness emerges as Mother feels for her own son, mental peace becomes our eternal friend.
Vartuhari had said that by doing regular yoga, our sons, our sisters, our sisters, our brothers, the world works to fulfil our beds and knowledge.
Whenever there is one of these qualities, it is natural that the Yogi wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I appeal to all the people of the country to take forward the great heritage of Yoga and make a healthy, pleasant and harmonious nation.
My dear countrymen, today on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's Tirodhan Day.
I salute Panditji.
In the month of May 1857, the Indians introduced their power to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were embarrassed against injustice.
It is a matter of sadness that we have been calling the event of 1857 as a revolt or a military revolt for a long time.
This incident was not just a small one, but it was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar wrote that what happened in 1857 was not a rebel but the first fight for independence.
The heroes of India House, London along with Savarkar celebrated the 50th birth anniversary in collaboration with him.
He was a practitioner of both weapons and sciences.
Veer Savarkar, originally known for his struggle against Bahaduri and the British rule.
But apart from this, he was also a poet and social reformer who has always emphasized goodwill and unity.
Savarkar ji gave a wonderful description of our dear, respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Sovereign poetry and revolution are taking both together.
Being a sensitive poet, he was a brave poet.
Our daughters, who were once forced to visit the waste stupa from the grasshoppers to the households, today they are learning the sewing work of the poor.
I extend my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and faith.
He has shown that if you are willing to show something and you are grateful for it then you can achieve success in every difficulty and this is not just about Seekar but you can see it in every corner of Hindustan.
Looking around you, among the neighbours, you will see how people are causing problems.
You have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, we get satisfaction by eating tea there, some people have discussions and analysis.
These discussions are political, social, films, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country should be solved in such a way, but most often these discussions are limited to discussions.
He organised education, health and food for all the children who came to school.
He kissed the darkness of their life.
TAMSO MATAGAMAYA: I don't know this evil, but I don't know D Prakash Rao.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for all of us, for society and for the entire country.
There will be many inspiring events around you.
There may be numerous incidents.
Let us take a positive mindset forward.
The month of June is so hot that people wait for the rains and hope that the clouds of the sky are like a shield.
People will wait for the moon after some time.
Looking at the moon means to flee Egypt.
At the end of one month's fast at the time of Ramzan, the festival of Idai is a symbol of the beginning of a glorious festival.
I am confident that everyone will celebrate Eid with compassion, especially the children will get good happiness on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
My best wishes to all.
My dear countrymen, I thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018

The entire country has seen this game.
The sportspersons in the Games have come from small towns across the country.
It's a lot of obstacles that have reached this place.
Today, their parents, parents, coaches, other helpers, schools, school teachers and school environment have played a significant role in their lives.
They also have friends who have enhanced the morale of sportspersons in all circumstances.
I would like to thank all the sportspersons and congratulate them.
Janek gentlemen, Mr. Shashikant Bhosle shared a picture of his swimming pool, my body is my weapons, my original material water, my world is swimming.
Secondly, I feel happy and healthy by roaming in the morning by writing Ruma Devnath.
He further said that fitness brings smile and when we are happy, we will laugh.
Smt. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness is fitness.
Dhabal leopard wrote with a picture of his trekking.
Traveling and trekking for me is Fit I India.
It is good to see that a lot of people named are also attractively encouraging our youth for Fit I India.
Chitravineta gave a video to Akshaykumar Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll also see, in this video, he's getting a wooden piece of exercising.
He said that this exercise is very beneficial for stomach and back muscles.
I think this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for all of us.
You're also preparing.
The significance of International Yoga Day on June 21 has now been accepted by the world.
There is no need to tell anyone in India or in the world about the use of Yoga in order to normalize the mental condition in the entire physical development.
You might have seen an animated video where I was shown.
I would like to thank the animation producers for taking care of the work that one teacher can do through animation.
My young friends, you all are thinking about the holidays.
I would like to invite you for a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time to learn something new.
Outside the four walls, paper-columns, computers have a new experience of living.
My young friends, I would urge you for a special internship today, the three-four Ministries of the Government of India, such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Department, together with Swachh Bharat Summer II.
Those who have worked very well in colleges and universities will be awarded nationally and those who have been successfully awarded INDIA.
I invite the students and the youngsters to join the internship once again.
I hope that our youngsters will go ahead with the cleanliness movement.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experience, send the storey, send the picture, send the video.
See how many people from different parts of the country are doing well and how good things are being discussed.
Just a few days ago, I saw that some young children from Delhi have been studying in sufficient amounts of money and have started a fun for the education of the children of Delhi's pathways and settlements.
Initially, they explained to the beggars of the road and the smaller working boys, they also joined the development work.
Initiative of 15 children from the slums near Geetha Colony, Delhi today has become a part of studying two thousand children at 12 locations in the capital.
Young teachers are participating in the Bhagirath effort to transform the society by taking out two hours of free time from their daily busyness.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some farmers of Uttarakhand have set an example of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed their fate, but also their fate.
The cultivation of peanuts, peanuts is done in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand.
Because of the hilly areas, the farmers were not getting the right price for their crops, but the farmers of Kapkot funds had taken the path of value addition by avoiding the losses of selling their crops directly in the market.
They have made biscuits from farm crops and selling biscuits.
These farmers have created a government company in Munnar and have opened biscuit bakery.
The government has made it a National Livelihood Mission by seeing these efforts of the farmers.
This biscuit has spread to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district, even Kosani Almora.
With this endeavour of the farmers, the turnover of the company has not only reached 10 to 15 lakhs, but also more than 900 households have been provided food grains.
Dear countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will start in the coming days.
Everybody says, but do we have no responsibility
Water conservation is not a new thing for Indians.
It is not a matter of reading books, but it is not necessary to know any particular language.
Our ancestors have shown that in the past.
They have given the highest importance to every drop of water.
They have taken new ways to save every drop of water.
You will see somebody going to Tamilnadu, in many temples there are scripts related to irrigation, water conservation, water conservation, Dighi construction etc.
Large sculptures can be seen in the temples of Manarkoville, Chiran Mahadevi Kovilpatti and Pudukottai .
Even today, many bouries i.e. Step Wells are known as the tourism sector, but in fact, they are a significance of our ancestors' efforts to conserve water.
If you go to Rajasthan, you will definitely go to see the moon buri of Jodhpur.
This is India's largest and most beautiful boury, one thing we have to remember is the biggest boury in a region where there is a severe water crisis.
Water conservation work will be as effective as the pre-determined time for water conservation and pre-determination in April, May, June-July.
Manrega can be spent on water conservation from the budget.
In the last three years, many people have been making several efforts in water conservation and construction of dams.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent for water conservation and water dams in Manrega Budget every year.
In 2017-18, I can say that out of 64,000 crore rupees, 55 per cent of the total amount of water conservation has been spent.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of farming have been benefitted through this water conservation and water reservoir.
This work has been done with the hard work of about 40-45 villages.
I will tell you that April, May, June, July, we are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water conservation in the coming days, we can take some plans and show something.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat happens, there are several news from all around the country, letters and phones.
However, the Philosophy that saves Rabindranath Tagore's peaceful, beautyful and integrity is not known by the people.
Please tell you about this in the Mann Ki Baat program so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he had a unique impression on all things, Rabindranath was a talented person, was a strange personality, but he had a teacher inside him.
He wrote in Geetanjali: "He who has the knowledge of the responsibility to inpart it to the students", that is, he has the responsibility to share the knowledge with the inquisitors.
The routine means that when humans are indulged in themselves, they can feel hungry for others.
When he feels thirsty, he feels thirsty.
This is the time of remembering the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad.
The teachings of his life create our commitment to the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a Poigambar asked him, "What is the best thing in Islam
Pygambar said, "Independing the poor and the underprivileged, and maintaining harmony with everyone in familiarity.
Pygambar Mohammad was faithful in knowledge and compassion.
He wasn't afraid of anything.
He said that arrogance defeats knowledge.
Pyagambar Mohammad had said that if someone has anything more than required, then you should give it to someone who needs it and that is why there is a special significance of donation in Ramzan.
In this holy month, all of them gave donations to the underprivileged.
Paigambar Mohammad believed that the person's own sacred soul enrichs him not rich.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that the statue of compassion, service and sacrifice of India is the country of Lord Buddha who has guided millions of people in your world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the great responsibilities of efforts, resolutions and walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is an inspiration for equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is such a human value, which is the highest requirement in the world today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to say with great emphasis that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words
The people of the country have empowered these marginalized people through the Constitution, whether it is dalit or oppressed or deprived.
There can be nothing bigger than compassion.
This was the compassion of Lord Buddha for the sufferings of human beings among his great qualities.
We have received the teachings of Lord Buddha inherited by all Asians.
These traditions of Buddha in many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar etc. are associated with the roots of Buddha and that is why we are building Buddhist tourism infrastructure which is connecting the important places of South-East Asia to Indias distinguished Buddhist regions.
I pray for the blessings of those great men all over the world that we can smoothly fulfil our responsibilities in the creation of a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today we remember Lord Buddha and you must have heard the statue of Lafing Buddha, which is said to have brought the fortune of Lafing Buddha, but very few people know that this Sahasya Buddha is also associated with an important event in the history of Indias security.
You might think what is the relationship between Lafing Buddha and India's military forces
You must remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of 11th May, 1998, the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee had spoken to the people of the country, which filled the country with a message of pride, valour and happiness.
A new self-confidence was awakened among the people of India, despite being spread all over the world.
That day was Buddha Purnima.
Nuclear tests were conducted on 11th May, 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan in the western part of India.
This test was done on the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
Indias tests were successful and India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as a day to showcase its military strength in Indias history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is essential for peace.
In this way, when you can become stronger as a country, you can stay with everyone peacefully.
The month of May 1998 is not only important because the atomic tests were conducted in that month, but the way it was possible, it is more important.
This event showed the whole world that India has the power to reach new goals and heights by keeping the land of great scientists in front of a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji gave the mantra: Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to commemorate the 150th anniversary of 1988 on 11th May, the mantra of Atal ji Jai Vigyan, which we have given for Indias strength, we have to move forward to build a modern India and to make a strong India, a strong India, a strong India and a strong India.
We have to make our energy a part of Indias energy.
And then, we can achieve a new joy and new satisfaction to take the journey that Atal ji started to see.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about Mann Ki Baat again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, representatives from ASEAN groups came here and brought various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had set up Ramayana before us.
That is, not only in India but also in the ASEAN group countries of the world, the inspiration and influence of Ramayana is still the same.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you all this time.
I read what I have written in MyGov about starting the online course of Komal Thakkar Sanskrit.
Besides being an IT worker, I am very happy to see your passion towards culture.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about this.
I also urge all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to think about how this proposal can be taken forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar read the views on the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed your concern over the decreasing level of ground water, it is very important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every living creature living in this land.
You have requested water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal-ji, I've got your idea to all the listeners friends.
Yogesh Bhadresha said, Let me talk about the health of the youth.
He said that in comparison to other Asian countries, the youth of our country are physically weak.
Just a few days ago, the Honble President of France visited Kashi and wrote Shri Shanti Kumar of Varanasi that all the scenes of the journey touched him and inspired him.
He expressed his keen interest and said that all the pictures and videos should be published on social media.
Pacific Ji, the Government of India shared all the pictures in the Social Media and the Narendra Modi App that day.
I would like to tell all the children like Angha, Jayesh that when I read all these letters sent to them, my day-long throats and hard works flew away.
There are so many letters, so many phone calls, opinions, what I have read, which I have heard and there are many things that have touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, distributed the holiday plans, thinking about the waters of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent a letter to me about the ongoing work of Kisan Mela and Kisan Mela across the country.
Some conscious citizens have sent me advice on water conservation.
In the season of festivals, there are many letters about our festivals, our culture and traditions.
Whenever I read a letter to you, I know that a rickshaw driver from Karimganj in Assam, Ali Ali, filled with his will power, built nine schools for the poor children, then only this country has an indomitable will power.
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Mohammad of Kanpur, who visited the footpath and treated the pedestrian brothers and sisters of the pedestrian and gave priceless medicines, he was proud of the patience and humanity of the country.
The sister of Cydol Lasker died in 1998 due to lack of timely treatment.
There are many such inspirational events in my country.
Today, the whole world has seen India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is enhanced with great pride, the zeal of the children and children of this country remains hidden.
My dear countrymen, the next few months will become very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
Because there have been a lot of letters related to agriculture.
This time I have seen the video of the programme that I have interacted with the farmers friends in the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan and I felt that this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan should see all the farmers and should use agricultural advice in their own fields.
Whether it was Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri ji or Lohia ji or Sardar Charan Singh or Bahubali Devilal ji, everyone would have considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur always emphasized the need for conservation of classical trees, plants, forests etc. and better agro-processing.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of a holistic public awareness to ensure better income, better irrigation system for our farmers and to enhance food and milk production.
In 1997, Shri Charan Singh in his address urged farmers to use new technologies and innovate.
Our Meghalaya farmers have produced record production in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have shown that if the goal is fixed, if there is full confidence, if there is a pledge in mind then all can be made possible.
Today, technology has been mixed with the hard work of the farmers.
This has resulted in enhanced energy for the agricultural producers.
I have seen in the letter that I have received, many farmer friends have written about MSP and they want me to discuss this in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give the farmers the right price.
It has been decided that MSP for specific crops, at least one and a half times investment will be made.
Besides, there is a detailed work on the Agricultural Marketing Reform in the country to ensure that the farmers get the price of the crops.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the local markets of the village are connected to the world.
To ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their produce, 20,000 rural huts will be upgraded to the necessary infrastructure of the country and connected to APMC and e-NAM platform.
This means that a system is being created to connect with any market of the country with a single field.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is being inaugurated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
I urge you to share your thinking with all of you through MyGov.
What can be the Logo of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier in charge of the Ministry of Health.
Privative healthcare is very cheap and easy.
As much as we are aware of private healthcare, individuals, family and society will benefit from this.
Cleanliness is the first condition of keeping life healthy.
Besides, work is going on to create a Health Wellness Centre across the country.
As a Preventive Health Care, Yoga has created its identity in the world in a new way.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and capable.
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached home.
This year, International Day of Yoga is on 21st June and there is no remaining 100 days.
In the last three International Yoga Days, all the people from all over the country and abroad participated with great zeal.
Even now, we have to ensure that we will join ourselves and encourage all family members to participate.
In a new and innovative manner, Yoga has to be popularized among children, young and adult people, whether it is man or woman.
The country's television and electronic media have different events on Yoga.
But from now on, can we create awareness about Yoga as a campaign till Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of yoga but I am a Yoga practice.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own ideas and made me a 3D animated video of my Yoga.
I want to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Adequate efforts are being made to ensure that healthcare is inexpensive, inexpensive and affordable for the people.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart stent prices have been reduced to 85 for heart patients.
The cost of artificial knees has also been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the present 479 Medical Colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
A new medical college will be opened in every three districts.
You need help to reach this awareness to everybody.
To get rid of Tuberculosis, we all have to try together.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar had spoken of Indias industrialization.
In his vision, Industrialism is a strong medium, which will provide income to the poorest of the poor in the country.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt: India will be a strong hub of labour at a time.
Today, when the Make in India project is progressing successfully all over the country, then his dream is a visionary inspiration.
India's position in the global economy is now like a bright star and the highest FDI in India.
Global trade is now looking at India because we are now becoming the hub of investment and innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply faithful in self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar said that a person of the country should not live in poverty.
He also believed that poverty cannot be supplied by the donation of the poor.
Today, projects like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India are creating youngsters and youngsters in our country.
He said that the visionary people had said that the rivers and valleys were managing the Parliament and imagined that water conservation and use would be a variety of working committees.
Today, the historical development of waterways and port expansion has started in the country.
New ports and old ports are being built on different coasts of India.
During the decade of 1980, when the world was in the second war, the cold war between the two powerful powers and the tensions of the country, Dr. Ambedkar imagined the spirit of Team India or India.
He understood the importance of federalism or friendship and hence he thought that the Centre and the States had to work together for the betterment of the country.
Today, we have been inspired by the cooperative federalism at every level of the country-ruled government and a competitive co-operation mantra.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for innumerable people like me in the backward communities of the country.
India is completely different: This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, who belongs to the poor, who are all backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organised across the country from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
This campaign will include various programmes for rural development, poverty and social justice.
I urge all of you to participate in this national campaign in a self-sufficient manner.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many festivals and festivals have come here later: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Esther and Vaishali.
Let us remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir Mahavir on Mahavir Jayanti.
The life and philosophy of the propagator of non-violence Lord Mahavir is inspired to us.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
Esther Ellai remembers Christ who wanted humanity, peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea is blue, but we know from the daily experience that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought it's like the sea, why the water becomes colorful
This was the question of a young man in the decade of 1920.
This question was the generation of a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, India Ratna sir C.
He was awarded the award for excellent workforce on light skating.
His discovery is known as Raman Effect.
We celebrate on 28th February every year as the National Science Day, it is said that on this day, he discovered Light Scattering, for which he was awarded the Christian Award.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
Bosan is also known as Satyendra Nath Boss.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai to inaugurate the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very attractive to know the extraordinary work done in the field of science.
The artificial intelligence helps in creating robots, boats and manufacturing machines.
Nowadays, through self-fillering, various machines are making their intelligence even more smart.
Technology can improve the lives of the poor, deprived and vulnerable people.
At this event of Artificial Intelligence, I would like to tell the scientists that what kind of artificial intelligence can be provided to ease the lives of Dibang brothers and sisters
Can we get better predictions about natural calamity through Artificial Intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence simplify Nagalpawa for healthcare
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate the I Create Ceremony in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There, a young man said that he has created a digital instrument where if anyone cannot speak, it becomes a voice when he writes about that instrument and you can interact in such a way as you can talk to a person who cannot speak.
I think we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and Technology Valueutral.
You-you don't have a price in this.
Any machine we want to do the same thing.
But it depends on us what we want from the machine.
Tomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, has been unsuccessful.
Once he was asked about this, he said, "I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making light bulbs," meaning Edison made his failure his own strength.
It is a matter of great privilege that today I am in Auroville, the land of Maharshi Arvind.
As a leader, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, stood in the face of questioning their rule.
In this way, he questioned every matter of life like a great sage, finding answers and guiding humanity.
It is important to ask the truth again and again.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of crisis, I have many messages about safety and disaster and people send me something or the other.
Shri Mannavendra Singh, from Pune, sent his speeches on Occupational Safety at the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that in our country, apart from the factory and construction work, the safety standards are not good.
If we are not aware of safety in everyday life, if we cannot import security, then it is even more difficult to ensure security arrangements during any major risk or disaster.
Most of the accidents are the result of our misconduct.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and save our society from any major accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that many directions have been given regarding safety in the field of work, but that rules are not followed at all.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities that have fire brigades, but not once a week, let them go to school at least once in a month and drive a muc drill in front of the students.
It will be of two benefits - the habit of being cautious and the new generation boys will also be able to learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading the disaster combat across the country.
A scheme called Apada-Mitra has been launched to train volunteers in Cyclone or Banya-Pravan districts.
Training and awareness is very important.
Two or three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or Heat Wave.
Since then, NDMA organised a workshop on Heat Wave Comprehension and launched a campaign to increase public awareness.
We have a good result in the collective endeavour.
Due to heat flow in 2017, the number of deaths declined unexpectedly to almost 220.
By this it can be understood that if we give importance to safety then only we can stay safe .
I would like to honour all those who are present at the event in a moment when an accident occurred to the victims and help the victims.
The number of heroes is not very low.
Besides, Apple is always in danger. Firend Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Para-Military Forces and Armed Forces who rescued others by risking their lives.
India and other BI MSTEC countries i. e. Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal participated in this exercise led by India a few days ago.
We all heard that many times.
But today if someone takes us to the plane and questions where things are kept , where life jackets are kept , how to use them , etc . I am sure , no one can answer it .
If we become aware of our safety then the security of the society also becomes included in it .
My dear countrymen, in this budget, emphasis has been laid on the production of WasteTo Wealth and Wasteto Energy through biogas in the village to create Swachh Bharat.
For this efforts have started and its name has been given GOBAR Dhan i.e. Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to make the villages clean and to make the livestock livestock dung and after farming the remaining waste into compost and bio-gass to generate income and energy.
The dung of animals and other biological ends in any European country and China are used for energy production.
But it was not being fully used in India.
We are moving forward in this direction by involving this in the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
The goal is to use bio-gass-based energy generation for the livestock dung, residual waste after agriculture, kitchen waste etc.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will encourage the farmers and rural brothers and sisters of rural India to see dung and waste as a source of income.
The use of biogas in cooking and power generation will also increase self-reliance.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
New employment opportunities will be generated in the sectors such as waste collection, transportation, bio-gas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created to ensure proper implementation of the Gobardhan scheme, which will connect the farmers to the buyers, so that farmers get the right value of dung and agricultural waste.
I would urge the enthusiastics, especially the sisters living in the village, to come forward and create self-help groups, to unite and make full use of this opportunity.
I invite you to join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs, to transform the waste of your village into wealth and to make cow dhan from Goa.
But we came to know about a unique effort in Raipur of Chhattisgarh and that is , the first ' waste festival ' organised in this state .
The objective of the Festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to increase awareness about cleanliness, creativity of urban waste and create awareness about various methods of reuse of waste.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation , the entire Chhattisgarh and the government and administration there for showcasing the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a new way in this festival .
International Womens Day is celebrated on 8th March every year.
There are various events in the country and the world .
On that day through the contribution of ' Nari Shakti Puraskar ' in the country those women who have done exemplary work in different fields in the last few days .
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development except women's development.
Today, at this moment, I remember a word from Swami Vivekananda.
150 years ago, this idea of Swamiji reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
It is the duty of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women powers have shown their self-sufficiency and self-reliance through their work.
They have advanced themselves and have taken the country and society forward and have taken a new height.
Finally, our dream of a New India is that where women are empowered, strong and equally participants in the overall development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great advice.
He suggested that on 8th March various events take place with the aim of observing Women's Day , but with the aim of honouring the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and city .
This number is not small, 15 lakh women have been united and launched a month-long Swachhta Abhiyan.
In this campaign that started on 26 January 2018 , in just 20 days , these women have established a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets .
14 lakh women , 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives , 29 thousand water-strikes i . e . water-friends , 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Rajmistries .
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti , the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , which will transform the campaign of cleanliness in everyday life , the reform of cleanliness with force the nature of the people .
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Eliphanta Island seventy years after independence and the people of the country have shown this kind of joy and enthusiasm.
You are very well aware that Eliphanta island is ten kilometers away from Mumbai in the sea.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am amazing to know that despite being such a big center of tourism near Mumbai, electricity has not reached Eliphanta even after so many years of independence.
Three villages of Eliphanta Islands for seventy years - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Santbandar , the darkness that was left in the life of the people there , all these darknesss have gone away and their life has come to light .
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now Eliphantar village and Eliphantar cave will be lightened with electricity.
This is not just a new beginning in front of development, but also in front of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we have celebrated the 'Shivratri' festival.
The importance of Hollywood is the same as the importance of Hollywood Dahan, which is the reason why the evil is burnt to fire.
On the day of Holi, sit together on all the charming grounds, share each other's happiness, happiness, a beautiful moment and a Holi festival, a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day in Sotsah.
This is the first time in history that the top leaders of ten countries were present on the occasion.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App today.
He wrote, On 1st February, the death day of the astronaut imagination.
He has taken care of us from the Columbia spacecraft but has inspired millions of youngsters in the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for starting his long letter with the eternal departure of imagination.
If there is a desire and determination, if there is a humiliation to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several industrialists have contributed to the creation of various parts of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi don't know how many names
Today we talk about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures, Skandhapurana, Dasputra, Samakna, Dasputrana Pradhayan.
This is the reason that we have the importance of Islam in our society.
And that is why in our society, women have been given the status of strength.
This woman power binds the entire country, all society and family to unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has made many more examples later.
He wrote, Our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Sukhoi-30 warship will inspire him.
Three brave lady Bhavnakanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have been the drivers of the warplane and are currently training the 'Sukhoi-30' warplane.
Today there are many such areas where women are living first and our women power is showing something or the other.
It has also been linked to the Narendra Modi website as e-book.
Today, women have an important role in changing positive changes in the country and society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women's empowerment. You might think what could be connected to it.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first such railway station in India where all levels of employees are women.
Women workers in all sections.
Be it the Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Observer, Declaration People, Point Person and more than 40 women workers are handling the station.
Today our Nari Shakti is leading ahead.
When the tribal women talk about it, everybody feels sure that there will be a picture of jungles, the chest of the hills, there will be a familiar view of the girls walking in their minds.
However, our tribal women in Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country.
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is among the Maoist-affected areas.
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere there.
Tribal women living in such a tragic condition are self-sufficient by running e-rickshaws.
In a short span of time, all the women there have become participants of this process.
On the one hand, they are empowering themselves through self-employment as well as changing the pictures of the Maoist-affected areas.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special strength to the environmental protection.
I also appreciate the district administration there. From grants to training, the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We are repeated to hear that people say, "There is something that does not lose our existence.
Whatever negative decisions are prohibited, taking into account the reforms of what is necessary.
And the features of our society are to continue the process of soul reform.
The identity of any living society remains in the process of self-reforming it.
Several centuries of efforts against social evils, misconducts have been continuing in our country individually and socially.
Through this campaign, efforts are made to create awareness against social curse such as child marriage and propaganda.
He was sworn in the State to fight against misconduct like penalties and child marriage.
Youngsters, mothers and sisters, who are full of child, old, enthusiastic and enthusiastic, have joined themselves in this fight.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain continued to simultaneously connect to the borders of the state.
It is important for all the people of the society to participate in the real development process.
Let us all pledge together to remove such mischief from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration of the state, the human chain and the people of the state for giving them a special and comprehensive opportunity for the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore in Karnataka has written in Mai Gauv that his father used to spend six thousand rupees per year for his treatment.
He was not first aware of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
But whenever he came to know about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, the price of medicines was reduced by up to fifty percent.
He wished that while talking about Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about it so that more people can get information about it.
Over the past, many people have written to me about this.
I have also seen many videos and social media people are taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I know this kind of thing, I'm very happy.
Have a deep satisfaction.
And I was also very happy that Shri Darshan ji's feelings have come in the mind and the benefits he has got in the minds of others.
This will benefit the common man, especially the elderly people who are forced to take medicines everyday.
The lifelong medicines bought from here are prepared according to the approved standard of World Health Organisation .
This is the main cause of affordable medicines of good quality .
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These are not only affordable medicines but also new employment opportunities for private entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendra and Amrit Stores at Hospital.
The only objective behind these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh shared a picture from Maharashtra on the Narendra Modi App.
The picture was such that my attention was attracted to that film.
A grandmother joined the Clean Morna River sanitation campaign with his grandfather.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola had organized a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Mornna river through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
The Morna river used to flow twelve months ago, but now the weather is dependent.
The second sad thing is that the river was filled with wild grass and jungles.
There was a lot of waste in the river and around it.
Therefore, an action plan was created and in the first phase of Mission Clean Morna from 13th January, a day before Makar Sankranti, four kilometres area was cleaned on both sides of the Morna River.
Even on 20th January, this Swachhta Abhiyan was carried out in a similar manner and I was told that unless the Morna river is completely cleaned, this campaign will be carried out every Saturday morning.
This means that if a man takes a determined resolution to do something, nothing is impossible.
It is possible to bring about huge changes through the mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and municipality, all the citizens associated with this work as a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions about the Padma awards.
Discussions on news papers and television attracted attention.
But if you look at this thing with a little care, you will be proud to be proud of how great people are in us and it will naturally be proud of how today the common man of our country is reaching this height without any recommendation.
There is a tradition of awarding Padma awards every year, but in the last three years there has been a change in the entire process.
Now any citizen can deny any person.
This has brought transparency to the entire process online.
It is said that the election process of this award has changed completely.
Padma awards have been given to all those who cannot be seen in big cities, in news papers, in television.
Now there is no identity of the person in the awards but the importance of his work is increasing.
You may have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been creating toys for four decades, so that youngsters can enhance the zeal of science.
His efforts are being made to encourage youngsters from unemployed things to scientific use.
For this, three thousand schools of different parts of the country are inspired by showing films made in 18 languages.
One such narrative is the Sitaba Jodatti of Karnataka.
He is not called Goddess of Women Empowerment.
In the last three decades, he has worked greatly for the transformation of the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself to Goddess at the age of seven, but then he added his entire life to the welfare of Goddesses.
Not only this, he has worked unprecedentedly for the welfare of Dalit women.
You may have heard the name of Bhaju Shyam in Madhya Pradesh. Shri Bhajju Shyam was born in a entire family of a poor and tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for living, but he was fond of creating traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honoured not only for this honour, but also for the whole of India.
In many countries like England, Germany, England and Italy, his pictures have been exhibited.
The talent of Bhujum Shyamji, who brightened India's name abroad, has been recognised and awarded Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to hear the story of the tribal lady Laxmikutti in Kerala.
Laxmikutti teaches in the Kollar area and is still in the middle of the dense forests in the tribal areas in the shadow hut of Talpada .
He made five hundred pharmaceutical medicines based on his memory.
He has the ability to make snake bitter medicines.
Laxmiji has been serving people from his knowledge about this herbal medicine.
Identifying this unknown personality, he was awarded Padma Shri for his participation in the society.
Today, we want to mention one more name. Subhasini Mistrik, 15 years of West Bengal, has also been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who has sold utensils and vegetables to make hospitals.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, with his hard work, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost.
I firmly believe that there are many such gems, women and gems that no one knows, no one knows.
Sometimes we should bring such people to school and colleges to know their experiences.
There should be some effort in society outside the awards.
My dear countrymen, every year, 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.
This is the day when the revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bonds between Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, we organized a programme where all the Indian original parliamentarians and mayors from different countries of the world were invited.
You will be glad to know that Indian original parliamentarians and Mayors have participated in this event from many other countries including California, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and other countries.
Our Indian original people who live in different countries of Europe, who are working on cyber security, who are associated with Ayurveda, who are enjoying the minds of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for the recognition of Indian original people and through them to the people of the world.
Worshipping Bapu on 30th January, who showed us a new path.
These were not just the basic elements.
At present, we can see in every step how correct Bapu's message was.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path of Bapu's guidance, what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes to all of you on the eleventh anniversary of 2,000.
Namaskar .
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
The last festival of this year's Mann Kibat event and see what a wonderful convocation is today, the last day of 2017.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for almost a year.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme, your letters, comments and opinions have always filled me with a new zeal.
And just a few hours later, the years will change, but this sustainability of our dialogue will continue.
In the next new year, we will share many more new things, new experiences.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the festival of Hol Christmas is celebrated all over the world.
This festival is celebrated all over India with great joy.
At this time of Christmas, we reflect the teachings and teachings of Christian Christianity and the highest emphasis on Jesus Christ is the spirit of service.
This spirit of service is also reflected in the Satya Bible.
Ramkrishna Paramhansdev also said that Shiva is a life-serving person in knowledge and that every thing has human values on the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was the year of the 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
He has always inspired human beings, inspired by the Gurus, poets, poets and great warriors.
He has taught us to be oppressed against injustice and atrocities, to liberate from the bonds of caste and religion.
And although he had to lose a lot in his personal life in this endeavour, he never reminded him of the unemployment.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Let us pledge to inspire Guru Gobind Singh ji from his great philosophy of life and follow his ideals in our lives.
You must be surprised to think that New Year comes every time and Paulajanwari also comes every time, and what happens to be 'Every day'
The entire India is keen to welcome you in the 21st century of discussions.
You must be proud of yourself in the 21st century electorate.
The power of exchange is the biggest strength of democracy.
Because you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and starting from Paulajanauri.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to specially address the visionary youth of 18 to 25 years of Togabag jivan Shakti.
I believe that we will dream of New India by filling up the skills and energy of the youth full of life.
The new India we are talking about in the coming days is a poisonous India of racism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
India free from waste and poverty.
New India, whose drive will be peace, unity and harmony.
Walk a way for yourself, connect those whom you are associated with, and be prosperous in this way, let us move forward.
Think, how will we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave the form of a mass movement to the freedom movement.
My young brothers and sisters, this is the time when we also make the dream of a beautiful and meaningful India a mass movement in the 21st century.
Today, there have been a lot of opportunities for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Entrepreneurship, our youngsters are moving forward and are successful.
I would like to see how the news of these projects can be obtained at one place of New India Youth, there should be a visionary mechanism in this regard so that it can easily know about all these things in this world after the completion of eighteen years of age.
Dear countrymen, I had spoken to you about IPGTVT at the earlier Mann Ki Baat programme.
Nothing is impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
Everyone in English also said - Passimism Leadsto Weekness, Optimism to Power.
In the earlier Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the people of the country to share their positive moments in 2017 and welcomed 2018 at a positive atomsphere.
I am happy that people have shared their experiences in large numbers of social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi Apps.
Millions of tweets including positive India Hashtag have been launched which has reached more than 1. 5 billion people.
The transmission of a economy has started in India and spread all over the world.
Imperoring was the Tweet Arresponse that came.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some countrymen have discussed the events that have had a positive impact in the minds of the people this year.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Bhatia.
I live in Peacock Bihar, Pocket One, Phase One, Delhi.
 My name increases Jyoti Rajendra.
And he dies in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very beneficial with the help of the government and we were able to deal with the situation.
 My name will be satisfactory.
The National Highway was built in 2017 from different villages near our village.
Two events that our Indian soldiers have done - one of the surgical strikes carried out by the Pakistani soldiers who have destroyed the launching pads of the extremists and at the same time the valour of our Indian soldiers in Doklam was rare.
 My name is Satish Bawani.
Over the last forty years, there was water problem in our area and we were dependent on the pipelines built for the army.
Now we have a pipeline.
So in 2017 it's not big enough for us.
There are many people who work at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we all are creating together.
Let us enter 2018 with these small joys, start the New Year and take a strong step towards positive India.
When we all talk about positiveity, I also want to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirational story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak, the top of the administrative service of Kashmir.
He got out of hatred and hatred and topped up the administrative service examination in Kashmir.
You will be surprised to know that in 1997 the rebels burnt his ancestral house.
There was a lot of violence and violence that his family had to leave their ancestors.
The atmosphere of such violence around a small child was enough for darkness and tightness in the heart, but Anjum didn't let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspired the youth of the country.
Anjum has proved that however bad the situation is, the desperate clouds can also be eliminated through positive action.
I have had the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir this week.
The time I have spent with those daughters, I have inspired myself and this is the strength of the country, this is our youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is a discussion of the world's famous religious place, it is natural to discuss the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
In this world famous temple, crores of respected people attended the blessings of Lord Ayappaswamy every year.
Where the respected people come in such a big way, the place where such a great importance is there, how many challenges can be made to maintain cleanliness
And especially the place that is in front of the mountains and forests.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan launched a program called 'Punnam Punkavanam' and launched a Swachhta Abhiyan to enhance awareness about cleanliness.
He is a pilgrimage who will not be able to complete his pilgrimage until he is working for cleanliness.
There is no distinction in this campaign.
Every pilgrim is taking part in the cleanliness process as part of the worship of Lord.
Every morning there is a wonderful sight of this safai and all the pilgrims join it.
He may be a celebrity or a bowl or a fun officer or a common pilgrim, everybody participates in the Purnima Punkavanam programme and he has to move forward with cleanliness.
There are many such examples for the countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is on the verge of Sabarimala, the Punyama Punkavanam was successful and the pilgrims participated in it.
And we have pledged that when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary, his dream India will do something to offer a clean India gift.
Efforts are being made all over the country for cleanliness.
There is a change in the rural and urban areas where large people are participating.
The Worlds largest survey Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be organised from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to monitor the progress of cleanliness at the city level.
The scheme will be implemented among more than 4000 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
The Swachhta App will provide analysis for use and improvement in the services sector.
This will be seen in the process of keeping the city clean and transforming the habits of every citizen of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things look very small, but in a society it becomes far-reaching.
Today, I mention this kind of event in Mann Kiwat.
After decades, is this injustice to Muslim women
However, he did not give the right to Muslim women in our country.
I like it. Our government has paid attention to it.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken urgent steps in this regard and has changed this tradition of 70 years.
Today, a Muslim woman will be able to go to Hajkar without Mahram and I like that now about 1300 Muslim women have applied for abandoning the Mahram and have expressed their desire to go to Haj from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India.
I have advised the Minority Affairs Ministry that the women who want to go to Haj alone should get permission from them.
Our efforts will be to ensure that our women get equal rights like men and women get equal opportunities so that they can equate on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic day of our country.
However, the day of 26th January, 2018 has to be remembered specially.
This has never happened in the history of India.
The year 2017 was remarkable for ASEAN countries and India and both sides.
ASEAN completed 50 years and Indias Agreement with ASEAN countries in 2017 completed 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for us to meet the ten great leaders of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in such a way our country is a country of fervor.
Perhaps there is no day when there is no festival.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas together, and the new year is coming in front.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness for all of you.
We all move forward with new initiatives, new zeal, new hopes and resolutions, and the country also moves forward.
The sun rises in January and the Makar Sankranti festival is celebrated.
This is a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, every festival is connected to natural events in some way, but in our diverse culture, the way to celebrate these events of nature is different.
All these festivals are celebrated between January 13 and 17.
The name of these festivals is different, but the same element in its depths is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for all festivals.
Once again, greetings to all of you on New Year 2018
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There will be no one in India who does not remember or respect him.
He is a witness to all of us's youth and various events in the country.
He completed the ninth year on 28th September.
I was fortunate to have a phone call with my sister before traveling abroad.
This narrative was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke to his elder sister with great respect.
Modi ji: Latadi ji, salute
I am talking to Narendra Modi.
Lataji: Salute.
Modiji: I called for this because now on your birthday, Modiji: I will be busy traveling by air.
Modi ji: I will be back on 28th late night, and on 29th morning, your birthday will be over.
Okay, okay.
Lataji: Many people are bigger than age, but they are blessed with their own work.
Lataji: Yes, but I think this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the listeners.
Modiji:..
I am more happy when you say that your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you more because I can see and know how much you work and how much you work.
How much I have to think.
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I sent a man to him, to bless him.
Modi ji: My mother too was very happy to show your love.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to you all on your birthday.
But I was so busy that I couldn't get up in time.
Yeah, yeah, of course
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, this festival will once again be filled with new zeal and determination.
It's the season of the festival
The joy and brightness of the festival will continue throughout the country for the next few weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of this festival.
And this is what it says, darkness in the bottom of the lamp.
Perhaps this argument is not just a word, it is a direction for us, a philosophy, a motivation.
Think, on one hand some houses are illuminated in light
On the other hand, in front of him, some people sit dark in the houses around him.
Some households get sweets destroyed, and some households get sweet for sweets.
At least the extra or non-violent items of the house can be delivery-out.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends of NGO are doing this work.
They collect clothes, sweets, food from the people's house, then find the wicked and swallowed things to them.
In this season of festival, can we sleep the darkness of the lamp with full awareness and determination
Laxmi was welcomed in traditional traditions.
In our culture, girls are called Lakshmi because girls bring fortunateness and prosperity.
This year can we keep public programmes to honour the girls in our society, villages and cities
Can we keep the programme of honouring these Laxmis of India in this Deepavali
There are many daughters and daughters around us who are doing excellent work.
Some people are studying the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society through doctors and engineers, some are trying to get justice and justice.
May our society be proud of these girls in respect and respect.
Let them be honoured all over the country.
You can do one more thing, share the achievements of these girls in the social media as much as possible and use Hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
Just like we all launched a massive campaign called Self-With Dotter, which spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, during the Mann Ki Baat programme I have said that it is a funny gain that I am fortunate to speak directly or indirectly to many unknown people.
A few days ago, a student from far-flung Arunachal Pradesh, Alina Tang, sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roying, Arunachal Pradesh.
I'm very good to read, I think I'm very good to read before the book exams.
I like a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions for the students in this book, but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
Then look, my young friends also have the confidence that the chief servant of the country will have to talk about any work.
My young student friend, I first thank you for writing a letter.
Thank you for reading Exam Warriors twice or three.
If I can take time for a new edition, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers.
But I'll make a request to all of you.
Can you help me
I'll definitely take care of them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write in my own language, in my own way.
It may be that if your suggestions come in large numbers then my new edition will also be sure.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, you people know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through news papers and television.
But you know I'm also a common man like you.
I also heard that speech and watched the match.
Danil Madbhadev, 23, has a synonymous and transformed sense of affecting everybody.
I must be impressed.
Shortly before that speech, he was a 19-year-old Grandslam winner and League Rafael, Tenny's Laden Nadal.
Somebody else would have been sorry and disappointed in that situation.
He lauded his sportsman spirit for losing his lives after a strong fight, and set a bright example.
Champion Nadal also complimented Daniel for the game.
The sportspersons and winners in the same match are both academic.
If you don't have heard the speech of Danil Madbhadev, I would urge everyone, especially the youth to see that video.
It has a lot of learning for all ages, all conditions.
There are moments that are above Harjijeet, and these moments teach us that Harjijeet doesn't really mean.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I am going to say is just for your good.
The logic, the backbone will continue, but the problem should be solved before it is measured.
Otherwise the problem takes a big deal and solving it becomes a toxic tough thing.
If we are aware of the roots, a lot can be saved.
From this idea, I think that my young friends must talk about an important thing.
We all know how harmful the intoxication of tobacco is for health and it is difficult to get rid of this practice once.
Tobacco nicotine drunk.
The development of the brain is also damaged by the start of consumption of this tobacco in adolescence.
We all know about these things, but today I want to make you aware about a new matter.
You know, the ban on India-cigarette has been issued recently.
Different from ordinary cigarettes, e-cigarette is an electronic tool.
E-cigarette a kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating nicotine rich liquid substances, through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of common cigarette, but e-cigarette has become a misconception that it is not harmful.
It uses aromatic chemicals for smelling ordinary cigarettes.
We must have seen that in a family, he tried to smoke his father in a chain smoker hall so that no one else would smoke his family.
Cigarette, the little bitch of Chanbari, keep away from Birdi.
There is no smoke about cigarettes, those who are selling or seeing cigarettes, they all know that cigarettes are harmful.
But the e-cigarette matter is very different.
There are very little awareness about this.
The common man is not aware of the fatal aspects of e-cigarette and this is why the sanctuary-cigarette has entered the household.
Many times in the family, children are showing magic games in front of their mothers and mothers, without fire, without fire, without smoke, they say e-cigarettes, smoke and smoke.
You know, when someone smokes cigarettes around us, we smell it.
Even though cigarette packets are pockets, it can be understood through smell.
This is not the case of e-cigarettes, whether it is known to the youth, whether it is Ajanta or fascinate, whether it is in their bags, in the middle of the books or in their hands, they get intoxicated in the same way.
Youth Power is the future of our country.
E-cigarettes have been put in place so that these new instruments of intoxication do not humble our country, do not destroy the dreams of the family, do not destroy the lives of the children.
In any way, this drug disease cannot be rooted in society.
I urge all of you to abandon tobacco and stop nurturing any confusion about e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India means not just going to Jim every morning and evening.
The name of avoiding all these illusions is Fit India.
I believe, I don't think you're gonna be bad, but it'll be good.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace of those great personalities who have laid down their lives not for themselves but for others.
Our India, this land of ours is many rituals.
This country has gifted many human rituals.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that a human soul is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
That day, Pope Francis, Maryam is going to declare Treasia St.
Sister Marium Threasia has made an unprecedented contribution to human welfare in the short age of 50 years.
Once again I pay homage to Sister Maryam Threasia and congratulate the people of India, especially my brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150 Gandhi and at the same time, 130 crore Indians have resolved to completely stop the use of single use plastic.
The way India plays a leading role in the world on environmental conservation, the whole world is now focusing on India.
I am confident that all of you will be involved in the Single Use Plastic-II campaign on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in different parts of the country.
However, our own country has started a unique campaign.
Her work attracts my vision and I talk to him on phone and try to know and understand his new plan.
Perhaps his words will help other people of the country.
When I heard plogging songs for the first time, it was new to me too.
Perhaps this word is used in a slight way abroad.
Modi ji: Hello Repudaman ji, I am Narendra Modi.
This will not only take care of our health but also the mother of the world.
I believe that 130 crore people of the country will go a long way in building a single use plastic free India.
Ripu Damanji, thank you once again
My dear countrymen, the preparations for 2nd October are going on all over the country and all over the world, but we want to move towards the path of 'Gandhi 150'.
I want to save my lives for the welfare of the country.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is the dream of all of us. And that is why every year on 31st October, we run the Run for Unity across the country.
My dear countrymen, perhaps you will remember that on 15th August, I had told you from the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places in India.
Go to at least 15 places and go there and try to stay midnight.
You see India, understand, feel.
We have so many varieties.
On the occasion of Deepawali, all of you go for a walk, so I urge you to visit 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has improved a lot in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and it has been possible with the help of all of you.
This has been possible due to the importance of traveling especially.
This means that we have gone a long way in this time and if we try more then we will be able to achieve one place in the world in tourism before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of several festivals of this diverse India.
You must also see that in the days of Deepavali, there should be no fire occurring anywhere or no harm to any person.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepavali, the great festival Chhot is one of the most holistic festivals in our country.
From food habits to abundance, every matter is celebrated with traditions.
Chhat Puja is fully linked to the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water, at the centre of worship of Mahaparvashta, and the utensils made of bamboo and soil, and the originals, are related to the practice of worship.
It also reflects the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Cleanliness of the entire city, along with rivers, ponds, near Khankhand, pilgrimage i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Conservation of environment, disease prevention and discipline.
This is the reason behind the practice of prasad and eating that the ego is destroyed, and the feeling of the ego that hinders the path of progress of the person.
It is natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat is bound up with the people of the country.
Take the example of Khadi and Handloom.
You must be happy to hear that the sale of Khadi and Handloom was so much on a single store.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Coopen has increased by six hundred and eighty percent.
Khadi and handicrafts motorcycles have also increased by about ninety percent this year as compared to last year.
It is observed that today, youngsters, elderly people, women and people of every age group like mankhadi and handloom.
I can imagine how many families, poor families, handicrafts and handicrafts have benefited from this.
And we used to talk about Khadi for fashion, but in the last few years, I can say that after Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion, Khadi for Transformation is taking place.
Khadi has emerged as a powerful instrument to transform the lives of the poorest of the poor and to empower the poorest of the handloom.
Gramoda is playing a very big role.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about the experience of my Diwali with the Defence Force and he also wants to know how the Defence Force celebrates Diwali.
Mr. Tejas uadwad also wrote the Narendra Modi App - What can our households be accessed to the Defence Force
We also think of our brave security forces.
We also believe that our household sweets must reach the soldiers of the country.
You all have spent Deepavali in a very joyous way.
Deepawali has brought me a special experience.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces.
This time I was forgotten to celebrate Deepavali with the Defence Force in the Gurej sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every soldier of our defence forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our defence forces protect the country by tackling the difficult situation in the border.
Whenever we have an opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our soldiers and we should hear their pride.
Many of us do not know that our defence forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only in the border but also in the entire world.
Being the United Nations Peace Defence Force, they are brightening India all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, UND was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we follow Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing to the various UN initiatives.
You will certainly know that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter, both of these words begin with the words "With People".
India has always stressed on the equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
It was proposed in the early stages that Al-Man and Burn Free and Equial, the representative of India, Hansa Mehtata, has been transformed into an effort and later it is Alhuman Beings and Burn Free and Equiale.
Though it seems to be a very small change, we have a philosophy of a healthy mind.
Indias role in the United Nations peacekeeping efforts is one of the most important contributors in UN Amberla.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace Education Mission.
There are many of you who probably know this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 defence personnel have contributed to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts.
At present, about seven thousand soldiers of India are associated with the UN peacekeeping utilities and this is the third largest in the world.
Until August, 2017, about 50 of the worlds peacekeeping efforts have contributed to their contribution.
All these efforts are underway in different parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated at the Indian Army Hospital in Kango and South Sudan and many people have been saved.
The defence forces of India have not only saved the people of the country but have also won their hearts by making efforts to protect peace.
Indian women have played a leading role in the process of peace establishment.
Very few people know that India is the country that sends women police units to the United Nations peacekeeping campaign in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has been inspired to all the countries since then.
Since then, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not only limited to peacekeeping but also to train 85 countries of peacekeeping.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha are conveying the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace-security campaign is not easy.
Our security forces have to go and work in remote areas.
They know different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the people of the country are proud.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, who was awarded the Paramvir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peace Protection Forces who have a special recognition of their work in Cyprus.
In 1997, at the age of 72, the Army Commander was appointed in the campaign of Vonamibia and served him to ensure the independence of Namibia.
The former General of the Indian Army, Thimaiah, led the United Nations Peace Defence Force in Cyprus and served in peace.
India is always a messenger of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
Let us believe that everybody lives a peaceful and harmonious life and move forward to build a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our pilgrimage to India is preserved by all such great personalities who have served humanity selflessly.
Sister Nivedita, whom we are supposed to be respected as Bhagni Nivedita, is also one of these great personalities.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later named him Swami Vivekananda 'Nivedita'.
Nivedita means a person who is fully dedicated.
Later, he proved the right glory of his name.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was 150th birth anniversary.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his joy and pleasure and sacrificed his life for the poor and the underprivileged.
Sister Nivedita used to suffer a lot in the tyranny of British Raj.
The British tried not only to physically but also to accept the slavery and slavery of the Indians.
We have always tried to demonstrate our culture.
Bhagni Nivedita revived the pride of Indian culture.
Encouraging, awakening the national consciousness, helping people unite.
He roamed around the world against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Famous nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be eternal for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Pen, NewWomen and Nari Shaktikaran.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was also a source of inspiration.
BhaginiVedita also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose in several ways.
Through his writings and various conferences, Shri Basu's publication of all the examinations and publicity helped both.
Our India is a wonderful co-existence in which the spirituality and science of our culture are complementary to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose is a beautiful example of this idea.
In 1899, the magnificent plague of the Calcutta metropolitan city was seen in Shaye Shaw.
Sister Nivedita, ignoring her body and health, came forward in Rastaghat, Nardama Safai campaign.
This is the woman who left the luxury and comfort and left herself for the poor and the oppressed.
Sister Nivedita is resting here, who has given her everything to India.
Of course there's an everlasting truth.
This will be our best tribute to this great personality - if every Indian educates from his life and follows the path of his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I extend my best wishes to all the children on the birth anniversary of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
Children are the most important part of the creation of a New India, the hero of the next day.
Your anxiety is true and all the diseases that were first seen in adulthood are being seen in the past.
It's surprising to hear that even children are victims of diabetes nowadays.
But now there is a lot of change in our lifestyle.
These diseases are now called lifestyledisorder.
The main cause of all these diseases in young age is the deficiency of physical labor and change in food habits.
It needs to be taken care of both society and family.
Considering this, there is no need for unnatural or malicious changes.
Whatever requires is to pay attention to small things and make them under their habits.
I want the people of the family to make an effort to create a habit of sports in the open field.
If possible, the elders of the family should also participate with them.
Children should have a habit of using stairs instead of lifts.
After dinner, let's take the whole family with the kids.
India-Yoga will help our youngsters in creating a healthy lifestyle and saving from lifestyledisorder.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be taught only by practice.
No specific equipment or fields are required.
Several examinations are underway in this regard, how effective Yoga is in control of diabetes.
A lot of work has been done in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very hopeful.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be treated as a disease-free method but should also be a part of daily life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy in the past few days from the world of sports.
Hockey like Badminton is also happy for India.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikant has won a wonderful game Denmark and has made every Indian proud.
This is his third supervisory victory after Indonesian Open and Australian 1997.
I congratulate this young sportsperson for his success and prosperity in India.
Friends, FI FA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from different countries of the world have come to India to participate in this and their sports skills have enriched us.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience was very enthusiastic from the game.
World Cup is a big event, where the world has an eye on you.
I was astonished by the zeal, spirit and zeal of young sportsmen.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best skills.
Even though India is not able to win, Indian sportspersons have won the hearts of all.
The entire football tournament was enjoyable for football lovers.
Football's future is very bright and its predictions are available.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, if I have to think about Swachh Bharat, then I have to celebrate Mann Ki Baat every day and discuss every Mann Ki Baat.
Somebody portrays the efforts of small children and somewhere the success of the youngsters' team fort.
Somewhere there is an event of innovation about cleanliness and somewhere the enthusiasm of some officer becomes new.
A few days ago, I got a big report where the rejuvenation of the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra has been described.
The entire team of NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a sanitation drive at Chandrapur Fort.
They sent me two pictures before and after Safai.
I am surprised to see and I feel that those who have been exhausted by the surrounding waste and filthy environment, think that they can see the pictures of this Chandrapur fort, I will tell them how the work, resolutions, jeeds and livelihoods of the young women of Ecological Protection Organization have been reflected.
Your disappointment, disbelief will go away from them.
This Bhagirath Prayag is a unique example of beauty, commitment and continuity for cleanliness.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Historical Saudha Safety and Conservation is the responsibility of all the people of the country.
I express my gratitude to all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and to all the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanakshudhu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is a Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity and gave the same words to all nations and communities.
The spirit of women has stressed on dignity and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev has travelled 28 thousand kilometers and has spread the message of humanity in this pedestrian journey.
He has joined people and guided them to honesty, sacrifice and devotion.
He didn't merely say that in his own life, in his own work.
He started the Langarkhana and transmitted service to the people.
Consumption of food in the lunch is awakened by unity and equality.
Guru Nanak has spoken of three meditations of meaningful life, enjoy the name of God, enjoy labour and help the victims.
Guru Nanak also created Gurubani for his propaganda.
The 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come, let us try to move forward in life by following his teachings and teachings.
My dear countrymen, and two days later on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created a plan for the modern India of Akhand.
We can learn a lot from the glorious life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel worked as a source of India.
He ensured millions of Indians in the shadow of One Nation One Constitution.
His distress gave the power to overcome all the obstacles.
He has set a goal and has moved ahead with that goal.
He said, "The country can work in a way as a man who dreamt of a nation where everyone has equal rights".
I want this word of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to inspire us forever.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of the nation and the community, every man and women of India should determine the future of love and mutual love and harmony.
The words of Sardar Saheb are still inspired and inspired by our New India Vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as National Integration Day.
His contribution to making our country an integral part is unforgettable.
Run for Unity will be organised across the country on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, where every child, women, youth and priest will be included.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, you have returned to your daily life with a new resolution and new determination.
My best wishes for fulfilling all the dreams of the people of the country.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Mann Ki Baat has completed three years through Akashwani.
This is the 36th edition today.
Most of them encourage me.
And I take half an hour for you once a month, but people start reaching their words for Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And because of this, the sensitivity of the government and the power of the society is being created to concentrate on them.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the people of the country.
And perhaps I am extremely grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity I have got to know and understand the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember that Acharya Vinoba thought.
Acharya used to say about Vinoba, often, non-governmental, effective.
I believe that after three years, socialists, universities, researchers and media experts will definitely analyze it.
And I believe that this analysis will be very useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and new enterprise.
And when I once said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think at the time of eating that we will not destroy it as much as we need.
But then I have seen that such letters have come from every corner of the country, many social organizations and many youngsters have been doing this work since a long time ago.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Self-With Dotter of a Panchayat chief in Haryana and I put it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India, but also in the world, Self-With Dotter has started a big campaign.
A few days ago, I was sitting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Incredible I will send photographs wherever you went to India.
Millions of pictures from every corner of India have become a funny source of tourism.
I have experienced how small events create a mass movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Today, I wish, because when I think it's been three years, how many events have come in my mind for the last three years.
The country is moving on the right path every moment.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the betterment of others, for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
In my three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat, I have learnt this from the people of the country.
This is a funny big wealth, a funny power for any country.
And I have seen a lot of attraction for Edening Khadi has increased and I have naturally said that no one has to read khadis.
But there's a lot of fabric, why isn't it Khadi
There may be room sheets, rooms, curtains, and it seems that the attraction of khadi in younger generations has increased.
Khadi's sales have increased and there is a direct relationship with the poor.
On 2nd October, Khadi is exempted, a lot of exemption is available.
I will once again say that the campaign for Khadi is going on, we will take it forward further.
We work with this feeling that we will buy Khadi and burn the lamps of Deepawali in the poor house.
The poor of our country will get one strength from this work, and we should do it.
And in order to increase the interest of Khadi, the khadi sector workers and the people associated with the Government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase productivity, how to bring solar power and handicrafts
How to revive the old legacy that was closed for nearly 20, 25, 30 years.
A Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh was closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several methods have been linked.
A lot of people have got new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centres closed in Pampore, Kashmir have a lot to be given to Kashmir.
Now this training centre is getting help in building new generations, building new things and making new things in a modern way for the resumption of this centre. And I am glad that the gifts that big corporate houses have given during Diwali have started giving them the things of eating khadi.
People are also giving khadi as gifts to each other.
We are all feeling how things are easily moving forward.
My dear countrymen, in the Mann Ki Baat last month, we all made a resolution and we decided that 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti will be celebrated across the country.
I will connect the people with cleanliness.
Our honourable President has started this work and the country is connected to it.
Old, male and female, city-village, everybody has become a part of Swachhta Abhiyan.
When I talk of a resolution, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward on the path of a resolution.
I mean, some people are doing the job of applying.
This time I saw another thing - first, we can clean one place, second, it may be that we will not waste any place awarely, but if we have to make cleanliness a habit, then there is a revolutionary change in our thinking.
This time a lot of competitions were organized in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the creation competition on cleanliness.
Thousands of children painted.
They have painted a picture of their own imagination on cleanliness.
Whenever there is cleanliness, I have never forgotten to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We are looking at the Swachhta Hi Seva movement of our countrys electronic media and print media.
Just a few days ago, somebody has attracted my attention to the 18-year-old young Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
From the age of 12-13, that is, the last 5-6 years, Bilal has been working with cleanliness.
The biggest lake near Srinagar is also cleaning plastics, polythenes, bottles and dirt.
I am glad that the municipality has not only made Brand Ambassador, they have given Bilal a car, uniform, and Bilal is also educating the people of other areas about cleanliness, inspiring them and does not move until they get the desired results.
Bilal Dar is a small but inspiring for those who are interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we have to acknowledge that the history of the future takes place in the womb of history and when we talk of history then it is normal to remember the great men.
It's the month of October to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel in October this month, many great personalities who have led us in the 19th and 21st century, have shown us the path of walking and those who have suffered a lot for the country.
When the former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji used to talk to the youth, he often talked about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He recalled the programme with deepest intimacy and himself went to the village to witness Nanaji's work.
Remembering these great personalities, they do not have any benefits, we remember them, so that they can find ways to move forward so that they get the right direction for the future.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We are very simple to say - unity between diversity is India's specialty.
We are proud of diversity, even if we are proud of diversity, do we ever try to experience that diversity
I would like to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan, especially to my younger generation that we are in a waking condition.
Enjoy this diversity of India, touch it, recognise its pride.
This diversity of our country plays a very big curriculum for the development of your personality.
You go abroad, I don't have any choice, but sometimes you see your own house
People of North India will not know what is there in South India
The people of western India don't know what is in East India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President, Shri Kalam Ji, visited India, there was a new inspiration for the country to see, understand and live for the country.
These great men have visited the country in a broad way.
Initially, they tried to know and understand India.
We have tried to make India self-reliant.
Can we also not learn from different states of our country, rules of different societies or groups, traditions, their dresses, their dresses, their food habits as a reader, to understand and earn their lives
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we will not only be a visitor but also try to adopt, understand and accommodate the specialities of those places like a student.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of my own Hindustan.
It has also been experienced to stay in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I am taking this important responsibility of the country, then I feel very comfortable with the experience of that tour.
That's why I have a special advantage to understand many things.
I urge you also to see that this huge India is unity in diversity - not just as a slogon but also accomplish this reserve of our unprecedented energy.
It will not be repeated if one acre new food is eaten every day for the entire life.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
I would like you to leave this vacation only for a little while outside the house, for a little change - it doesn't happen.
Your worries will be greater.
What else can be a greater teacher than availability
Normally, the time from October to March is enhanced for tourism.
If you are introducing people then send them pictures.
Write not only about the architecture, but also of the natural beauty, but also of the public life there.
Send all the excellent subjects on your journey to MyGov and send it to the Narendra Modi App.
I have thought of one thing that if you are the seven best tourist destinations in your own state for the development of India's tourism industry, every Indian should know about these seven things in your own state.
If possible, we have to go to the seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You can see that if all these information is sent to the same state then I will tell the government that they should scrutinize them and that seven Common matters have come from every state.
This means how the tourist destination can be improved by the intention of a human being.
Likewise, the seven things you liked in the entire country, somebody wants to see it, somebody needs to go there, then you must send the names of seven such places in your choice to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work in this regard.
The government will adhere to films, video-making, propaganda literature, preaching and decision-making by you.
Come on, join me.
You can also be a big component for the improvement of tourism during the month of October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, in the fate of being a man, many things touch my mind and move my mind.
I have a deep impact in my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps your vision was attracted - a wonderful example of women's power and patriotism.
The Indian Army received two heroes named Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi, who are a great hero.
This is a wonderful reason that the husband of liberty and treasury had been martyred to serve Mother Bharati.
How will the mind be if the world breaks down at this young age
But Martyrs Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik has taken this decision in fighting against this difficult situation and has joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfil his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Doubey, his husband Mukesh Doubey worked as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for his motherland, decided to remember his wife's treasure and he also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to show respect to these brave people of our country on this strength of women.
I congratulate these two sisters in my heart.
They have inspired crores of people of the country and have awakened a new consciousness.
Congratulations to those two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Deepawali is a big opportunity for our younger generation.
The World Cup of FI FA Under-17 is going on here.
I believe you'll hear the sound of football all around.
Every generation will be attracted to footballs.
There will be no school and college fields in India where our youth will not be able to play footballs.
Come on, when the whole world is playing on the ground, we have also made this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
Mother Durga's feelings.
The entire environment is full of auspicious aroma.
On this auspicious festival of Navratri, I congratulate the people of the country and pray to the mother power, let our country reach new heights of success in fulfilling the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the ability to deal with every challenge.
The country should improve at a rapid pace and in 2022, the 75th anniversary of Indias independence - the efforts of the freedom fighters to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters, the determination of 125 crore people, the hard work of the country, the maternal power should bless us.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate the festival, enhance the enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel Ji, who dedicated to the unity of the country.
The universal values that our ancestors have enriched from ancient times have been linked to our lives.
Ohinsa Param Dharma, we are listening to it from 1980.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be buried in the name of faith, it can be a communal belief, it can be believed in political thinking or can any person believe in any tradition, violence will not be buried in any case.
Nobody has the right to hand over the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has ensured that every person has the right to get the information given by the Constitution.
I would like to assure the people of the country that the government or the country will not deserve anybody, whether it is a person or a community, against the people who have taken the law.
Everyone has to be known to the law, the law will judge it and the culprit will have to be punished.
Even our festivals are full of diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly connected to farmers and fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all I want to tell you Mitchami Dukkadam.
Yesterday, the festival of Sambashri of Jain society was celebrated.
In the Jain community, the festival of Poshan Parva is celebrated in Bhadra month.
The Samavastri festival symbolizes forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also known as 'Khama-Bani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other as 'Michhami Dukkadam'.
Besides, our scriptures include 'Amma Veerasyabhushanam' i. e.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
And when Ganesh Chaturthi talked about, the issue of Sarvajan Ganesh Deshotsav comes naturally.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to every countrymen on the occasion of Ganeshotsav.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is a major festival of Kerala in India's multi-coloured festival.
This festival is remarkable for its social and cultural importance.
The Omnam Festival reminds of the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
And now this festival has become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I would like to tell the people of the country that as the Navaratri festival of Gujarat or the Durgasav of West Bengal, today it has become the main attraction of tourism.
There has been a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
What steps can we take in the coming days - we have to think that we have to do the same.
Id-ul-uha will participate in this joyful fair.
I extend my best wishes and best wishes to all the people of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and cleanliness are linked to our family life.
The preparation of the festival begins with cleanliness.
It is not new, but it is very important to transform cleanliness into a social nature.
Universally, cleanliness is not only in our houses but in every village, in every city, in our state, in our country, this cleanliness and festival has to be binded in a bond that is incomplete.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of modernization is changing respectively.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see in YouTube, nowadays the children are making the statue of Ganesh with soil in the house.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta Abhiyan, the third anniversary of 2nd October.
Similarly, at a time, in Dhanara of Banaskantha district of Gujarat, the clerics of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind have handled 22 flood affected temples and 3 mosques with complete cleanliness and sanitation.
If this effort for dedicated sanitation becomes a permanent part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I urge you all to come, once again, I start the campaign of Swachhata Hi Seva 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, just as it was said earlier, Water Seva is Prabhu Seva and Swachhata Hi Seva.
We create a clean environment in the entire country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we should seek and use the opportunity.
Shramdaan.
Work together on holidays or on Sundays.
Go to the surrounding settlements, go to nearby villages, give it the form of a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, collectors and panchayat chiefs, to create a clean environment before the fifteenth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-In-I
My social media friends can run some creative propaganda in the virtual world that can actually be inspiring.
The Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi can be organised by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation for management, short films and film-making competitions.
You can write articles in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Among the participants, three at the district level and three at the state level will be selected and awarded.
I urge you to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
The number of audiences and millions of people sometimes send messages, sometimes send messages, send messages, which I have a supreme achievement and rare wealth.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the feelings and feelings of the people of the country.
I am more than you wait for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I look very interesting because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, hear, read and know yourself as much as possible.
Prime Minister ji, I am speaking from Pune to Aparna.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he has a habit that I'm surprised to see.
I went away with him once to buy.
I saw he bought a sari of two thousand rupees, spent Rs 450 for Pitzer.
In order to go to Mall, he worked for a long time with Autovala for five rupees.
He did the same work while buying vegetables on the way back and saved four-five.
I was very bad.
We spend a lot of money in big shops without money, but we don't trust the labourers brothers and sisters for a small amount of money.
I believe that after listening to this phone, you are not just aware, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
Do you not think that whenever someone comes to sell things around our house, comes back to sell things, some small shopkeepers and vegetable sellers, sometimes we need to work with auto-rickshaws. Whenever we work with a hard worker, we will be able to pay for it.
And when people like us go to eat food at a big restaurant, we don't see what the bill is written, we'll get the money out immediately.
Not only this, we don't care if we buy saris in the showroom, but if we work with any poor, we don't get rid of it.
You don't have any difference in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but have you ever seen how deeply your behavior hurts him
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you called me a heartbreaking message.
I believe that if my countrymen have the habit of doing this thing with the poor then they will surely abandon it.
My dear young friends, on 29th August, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This is the birth anniversary of the great hockey player and hockey magician Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is invaluable.
I remember this because I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
May the sports become part of our life.
If we are a young nation in the world, we should also look at this forest in the field of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness, personality advancement.
On the one hand, sports is a wonderful task to make the heart tie.
Our country's younger generation will come forward in a sports world and today in a computer age, I would like to make it aware that playing fields are more important than play stations.
Play films on the computer, but even outside the fields, sometimes with footballs.
Perhaps cricket plays on the computer, but in the open fields, the joy of playing cricket under the sky is different.
Today, the situation is such that the children are at a corner of the house and start watching the cartoon films or the mobile game becomes foolish and then the mother has to be cautious - when do you go out
Time changes, he was an age when Mother told the boy when you'd come and today it's a situation that mother would say, Dad, when would you go out
Friends, The Ministry of Sports has set up a sports talent search portal to explore and develop talent in sports, where the children from all over the country who have achieved some talent in sports can upload their biodata or video in this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
It is a matter of great happiness for our youngsters that on 6th to 28th October, India is scheduled to host Andar Seventin World Cup.
24 teams of the world are going to make India their homes.
Let us welcome our young guests from the world with the festival of sports, enjoy sports and create an environment in the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I remember that last week is a touching event and I want to share with the people of the country.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who had never been associated with the sea.
Six daughters of our country who work in the Navy will inspire all of us.
This six daughters, with a small boat - I-NS Tarini, will come out to cross the sea.
This mission has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India after several months of touring the world.
Sometimes one or forty days will remain in the water.
Sometimes you'll spend thirty days together in water.
Our six brave daughters in the midst of the waves of the sea, and this is the world's first event.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of these daughters
I salute the feelings of these girls, and I told them to share their feelings with the entire country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their thinking in the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, it's a bravery, it'll be a matter of your feelings, and I'll be happy to bring these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, the blessings of the waves.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of former President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President but for the whole life he made himself a teacher.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a dedicated life to education.
The great quality of a teacher is to awaken the mindset of creation and enjoy knowledge among his students.
Can I start a mission mode
In our country, when we talk about transformation, just as the mother of the family remembers, the same way the teachers play the role in the society.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
In every teacher's life, there is a transformation technician for some student and we all try in a holistic way.
It will play a big role in the transformation of the country.
Let us move ahead with this mantra of Tech to Transform.
My name is Dr. Unique.
I am associated with the residents of Mumbai and the India Research Centre of Howard University.
This scheme was launched on 28th August, 2014 with a dream.
3 years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed tomorrow, 28th August.
30 crore Indians participated in this scheme and opened their first bank accounts.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries in the world.
If you're in the house or in the pocket, you're in a bad way.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have collected about 65 thousand crore rupees.
Those who have opened accounts in Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, have also got the benefit of insurance.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, only one and three rupees premium has created a new self-confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, when the poor people are in trouble, the chief of the family died, the benefits of that premium are getting two lakh rupees.
I am very encouraging about the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana, Rupay Card, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, insurance.
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
People's mind is such that the rainy season is very pleasant for people.
Animals, birds, plantations, nature, everybody gets excited by the arrival of rains.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible form, it is known as the devastating power of water.
Nature is our lifestyle, our worker, but sometimes the nature of floods, earthquakes like natural illusions, its terrible form becomes extremely devastating.
This change in the climate and the change in the environment has a negative effect.
In the last few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Northeast, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to heavy rains.
The flood affected areas are being reviewed.
Extensive rescue operations are being carried out.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers are reaching.
The state government is also making every effort to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations, citizens wishing to do service work are making every effort to help the people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animals, infrastructure, restaurants, electricity, connectivity.
In particular, for the loss of crops and farms of our farmer brothers, we have prepared schemes to play a positive role in the IDA insurance companies, especially the Agricultural Insurance Companies, so that the claims of farmers can be resolved quickly.
People are talking about their misery.
Even before the rainy season, most of the mock drills and the entire government programme was prepared.
The team of NDRF was appointed.
Gradually, we have created ourselves in such a way that according to the predictions of the rain, we will do our work in such a way that we can get rid of losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country made more than me.
This time there has been so many letters about GST, so many phones have come and people are still expressing happiness about GST and asking questions.
I would like to hear you a phone call: Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I am very impressed to hear your speech at Chartered Accountant Day.
This is the reason why in our country, Goods and Service Tax-GST has started today.
I'd like to listen to you.
Thank you.
It has been almost a month after the GST is initiated and its fruits are showing.
And I am glad that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the price for GST has been reduced to the poor and how the goods have become cheaper.
Anyone living in the North-East, far-flung hilly areas and forests is telling in a letter that I was scared or not, but now when I learned it and understood it, I think the work has become very easy from before.
Business has become very simple.
And the biggest thing is that the customer's trust is increasing.
Now I see the impact of GST on the transport and logistics sector.
How the traffic of the truck has increased.
As a result of which strong small transition is taking place so that migration is going on forcefully, new registrations are taking place and this is creating a new faith in the country.
And sometimes, economists, management experts, pundits of technology, through their research, the use of GST in India will definitely be a model for the world.
This will become a Case Study for various universities in the world.
This is the topic of success in such a big scale, in such a big way, in such a large country, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way, in such a big way.
The world must do research on this.
GST has been implemented, every state has participated in it, every state has its responsibility.
All decisions have been taken together by all States and Centres.
And this is the primary goal of every government to ensure that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, central and state governments associated with this task.
GST is an excellent example of Indias overall energy success.
This is a historic achievement.
This is the campaign for social reforms.
I once again bow down to crores of people of the country for making such a big effort.
My dear countrymen, the month of August month's movement.
Yusuf Meh's Ali.
What happened to our new generations on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, how much they had to bear, how much they had to bear, how they had to unite themselves with the hope of independence.
This was the time when in every corner of Hindustan, in every corner of the city, in every village, in every corner of the city, in the educated, in the educated, in the poor and in the poor, all the people had joined shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder the uit India Movement.
Millions of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle by Mahatma Gandhi in the mantra of 'Karange Ya Marange'.
After the call of Mahatma Gandhi uit India Movement on 9th August, the British took all the big leaders in jail and then came forward to take up the movement.
Lohia, Jaiprakash Narayan, the leaders of the second generation.
Mahatma Gandhi's uit India Movement in 1920 and the 'uit India' movement in 1942 was divided into two different forms.
The face of the non-cooperation movement was similar, then the situation stood up in 42, the intensity of the movement grew so much that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Karange Yamreng'.
This was behind the success of public support, public strength, public resolve and public struggle.
The whole country fought together that day.
I have sometimes thought that the first freedom struggle of India was in 1857 when I saw the leaves of history collected.
The war that started in 1857 was going on every corner of the country by 1942 and in a long time it gave rise to a strong demand for freedom in the heart of the people.
Every man is committed to do something or the other.
Generations have changed, but the intensity of their resolve is not at all.
A single person has come here, has been associated with the struggle, has gone away, a new team has come, they have joined the fight in the same way and have tried every moment to produce the British empire.
From 1857 to 1942, the movement took place in such a way that it reached the peak in 1942 and the vision of 'Bharat uado' was rotten in such a way that it could go to the British in 1997 in five years.
Between 1857 and 1942, the jurisdiction of freedom came to every countrymen, and from 1942 to 1997, this five years of resolution was the cause of the independence of the country in the five decisive years of the Siddhi.
These five years were the mainstreamers.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We were free in 1997 and today in 2017.
It's about 70 years.
The government has come, has gone.
Policy regulations have been created, changed, modified.
All of them have made their own efforts to get rid of the country's problem.
In order to increase the income of the common man in the country, efforts are being made to eradicate poverty and development.
Expectations have increased.
We will celebrate this 15th August, 2017 as the launch of the Sankalp Parv and we will make that pledge as well as the 75th year of independence in 2022.
From 1942 to 1997, as the country was decisive of independence, this five years from 2017 to 2022 can become a decisive year for Indias future creation.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
There is a resolution that we shall make in the next five years.
Please come forward with video posts, blogs, letters and new ideas using technology.
This movement has to be transformed into a mass movement.
uit India uiz competition will be organised for young friends in the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz competition is an attempt to make the youth of the country familiar with the glorious history of the country and the heroes of freedom struggle.
I am happy that in the last three years, on 15th August, I have received several proposals from every corner of the country, the main objective of these proposals is to make their dreams a word.
On 15th August, I will try to discuss these proposals as long as I get.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about another thing today.
Socio-economics are linked to Indias economy.
It should never be eaten.
Our festivals and festivals are not just like this for enjoyment.
Our festivals and festivals are really connected to the economic life of the poorest of the poor with every festival of our country.
A few days later, Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, and then Phase-wise Ganesh Festival, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will be celebrated and this time the poor people will get some opportunity to earn money.
This festival also mixes a simple natural joy.
If we talk about the economy, a few months before the Rakhi Bandhan Festival, hundreds of households have become a guardian in small family business.
Several types of cottons like cotton, silk etc. are preserved in different ways, and today people like homemade silk.
Hundreds of thousands of traders are connected to a festival, such as those associated with Rakhi manufacturing, sellers and sweet businessmen.
These small lamps have been built by the poor families but Deepawali is directly related to them.
Today, when I talk about festivals, festivals and the economics of the poor people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I imagine that the people of the country are more aware and active than me and I have achieved that.
Awakening citizens have written to me about the last one month's environment.
They appealed to me that during the time I should talk about eco-friendly Ganesh on Ganesh Chaturthi so that people like the Ganesh made of the soil, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition this year, the 125th anniversary of the General Ganesh Festival.
125th year and 125 crore countrymen.
Lokmanya Tilak started Ganesh Festival keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also remember him and host the composition competitions, seminars etc. during the Ganesh festival this year.
Come, let us connect this festival with the economy of the poor, let us enjoy the joy of our festivals become the economic festival of the poor, let us enjoy economic joyment.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country for the upcoming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that be it education, economic sector, social sector or sports, our daughters are brightening the country, are reaching new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honored for them.
Just a few days ago, we have shown excellent skills in women's cricket.
This week, I had the opportunity to meet the girls.
They had an impression on their faces.
I told those girls I had a different valuation.
I have seen such a game that if India's sportspersons are unsuccessful, then the anger of the people of the country falls after the players.
Some people say something that breaks the dignity, some things that are very painful.
Not all this, the girls have done the quality of what they've honored them.
I am seeing a beautiful change in it, and I have told these girls that it is only your privilege that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters, are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of the August movement, once again on 9th August.
Let every countrymen guide every countrymen to fulfil their resolutions for five years.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
We will move forward with this belief that the fortune of the country and the future of the country will be better.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Climate changes.
It was very hot.
But fortunately, the rainy season is following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
After the rains, there is a feeling of comfort in the cold winds of the past.
We all have seen that whatever excitement or anxiety in personal life or in public life, the arrival of rain changes our mental condition.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Dev in different parts of the country is very enthusiastic and joyful.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannathji is celebrated in some other places of the world.
The poor people of the country are especially associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English, Juggernaut, which means a beautiful chariot that does not stop at all.
It is obvious that this word has come from Jagannath Devarath.
It is from this that the people of the world have recognized the importance of this journey of Jagannathji in their own way.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all take the country forward by inspiring us from this holy festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I came to know about a very inspiring incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he used to live in thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters, most of the Muslim families.
All the people of the village decided to make toilets in this month.
17 lakhs have been given to the Government for making individual toilets.
You will be happy to hear and wonder that in this holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of the state have returned 17 lakh rupees to the government.
17 lakh for other services.
I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur for this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything of them is inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have made Mubarakpur a free defecation-free area.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
I especially express my gratitude to the administration and the people of this five state for the completion of this work.
We know very well that we have to work hard to do some good work in personal life or in social life.
If my handwriting is bad, I have to make a lot of conscious effort to fix it.
This is the change in physical and mental conditions.
This is the same thing.
Some bad habits have become usual.
Everybody has to attract attention.
The inspirational events have to be remembered again and again.
I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
It is taking the form of a movement for the common man in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people, the energy becomes very simple.
I remember a good event in the past that I want to tell you.
The incident took place in Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their goal was to build 10,000 family toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and the local administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become Open Defecation Free.
In-A, through letters, all these suggestions are received in Akash Vani.
It is important to be aware of democracy and that is why it is necessary to recall the events that hurt democracy and encourage goodwill for democracy.
June 25, 1997 is a black day that cannot be forgotten by any Indian lover of democracy.
The entire country was transformed into a single prison.
The voice of the opponents was stopped.
The eminent leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were imprisoned.
Judicial systems have not been able to get rid of the emergency.
The newspaper was completely unusable.
Students from todays press conference also recall the Black Day and make consistent efforts to enhance awareness about democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem on the occasion of the Emergency Year, which explained the condition of his time in that poetry.
We have to make this heritage stronger.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today feels proud of himself by raising his heads in the world.
On June 21, 2017, the entire world became Yoga.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning and morning through yoga.
There are no Indians who will not be proud of this
It is not that Yoga was not practiced before, but today, when Yoga is tied in the form of Yoga, Yoga has become the cause of the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this Yoga self-reliant.
On the one hand, where people have practiced Yoga on the Great Wall of China in China, people have practiced Yoga at Peru's World Heritage Site at a height of 2,400 metres above sea level.
In France, IFFEL Tower has a shadow.
More than 4,000 people have collaborated in the UAE Abu Dhabi.
India-Afghan Friendship Dam Salma Bandh in Harat, Afghanistan has given India a new gift of friendship.
Seventy places have been organised in smaller countries like Singapore and they have launched a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations released 10 postage stamps on the occasion of International Yoga Day.
Yoga has been conducted in the UN Headquarters.
Employees from the United Nations, Diplomatra from all over the world participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people have joined together and have created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in the Yoga event in Lucknow.
But for the first time I am fortunate to participate in the rains.
Our soldiers have also practiced yoga in Siachen, where minus is 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Whether it is our armed forces, be it BSF, ITBP, CRP-FHOC, CISF, everyone has participated in Yoga with their duties.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, since it was the third International Yoga Day, I had said that three generations of the family would share their photographs together.
Some TV channels have taken this matter forward.
I have received a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been collected by selected photographs and kept on the Narendra Modi app.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to go to a very dear discipline.
For a few days a good event is being organized in Kerala, the PENPANICER Foundation has created a habit of reading among the people, the people are enthusiastic about reading books, so that reading day is being celebrated.
I had a chance to go to the start of it, and I was also told that we don't break flowers, books.
I'm good.
Now I also remembered what was left out of the center of my attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I created a custom in the government that we will not break, we will give it or we will welcome it with rooms.
She's gonna be a rumole to khadi's greed.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit goes away.
But the habit awakened again in Kerala.
And I've started giving notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The age of flowers is very low.
I have to take it from my hand once.
But if you give a book, it becomes part of the house, becomes a family member.
I went to London, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me to diet.
How many years ago, ueen Elizabeth has taken care of Mahatma Gandhi's roomal care.
And I went and she showed me very happy.
When I saw, I don't know if he wanted me to touch me once.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I am confident that these habits don't change overnight and sometimes they have to be critical.
But despite this, such things should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't tell you that I went somewhere and somebody broke the flowers, then I won't tell him, I can't do it.
However, there will be discussions, but we should continue to talk, it will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, as the Prime Minister, there is a lot of work.
I have to be drowned in the files, but I have made my habit, I have got some of the letters that I have received and I have the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people write letters.
I'm supposed to tell you about such a letter.
A homegirl of Tamil Nadu in the far-flung south, Arunmozhi wrote a letter.
What are you writing in that letter - saying, I thought of taking care of my world, to handle children's studies, so that there is some financial comfort in the world.
Similarly, in the Mudra Yojana, I started the work of buying some goods from the market by taking some loans from the bank.
In this context, I was told that the government has started a certain system called Government E-Marketplace.
So I registered myself with the search.
Anyone who wants to suppli anything to the government, can get electric bulbs, can suppli dustbins, brooms, chairs, tables, you can register what you want to sell.
He wrote, First of all I got rid of the Mudra Yojana and started my business, then I registered all my sales items in E-GEM, then I got an order from the PMO office of the Prime Minister.
I also had an unknown news, I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He told me, he bought the tragic thermos and got 1600 pents.
Yeah, that's the empowerment.
It has transparence, empowerment, as well as entrepreneurship.
Government-Marketplace-GEM
I want those who want to sell something to the government, the number of them continues to grow in such a way.
I understand this is an incomparable example of Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance and its goal is Minimum Price and Maximum Price, Office and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we can be proud of Yoga, and on the one hand we can also be proud of the success of Space Science.
This is India's specialty, Yoga has spread to the soil of our country and we have a far-reaching space campaign.
Earlier, India has achieved a lot of success in sports and science.
Today, India is bringing the strength of its success not only on the earth but also on the space.
The Todu launched 30 NanoSatellites with ISRO Cartosat-27 satellites a day ago.
These satellites include about 14 countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States, besides India.
And these Nano Satellites of India will provide a very beneficial information on the predictions of natural utility for the benefit of the farmers.
A few days ago, we must remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Consider how big our scientists have achieved space research.
On June 19, Mars Mission completed a thousand days.
You all remember that for this Mars Mission, we had to successfully set up in Orbit and its term was fixed for six months.
It was six months old.
But the extraordinary skill of our scientists has crossed a thousand days within six months.
Our scientific journey to complete this thousand days is showing great success in our space research.
Our younger generations are brightening their skills and physical capabilities in the field of studies and sports.
This is the day in Indonesia and Spain, Indias Badminton sportsperson Kidambi has enhanced the country's honour.
I congratulate Srikanth and his coach on this occasion.
T.
Sports plays a vital role in personal development.
Sports plays an important role in the development of a holistic personality.
There is no shortage of everybody in the country.
If the family's kids are inclined towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, the people of the country, the joy of celebrating the rainy season, the festival gives a unique feature to this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramadan has started.
In the holy month of Ramadan, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all the people of the world, especially to the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramadan, special emphasis is on prayer, spirituality and compassion.
We are fortunate that the Hindus have created a tradition that Indians are proud of.
We can be proud of the hundred and twenty-fifteen crore Indians that there are people from all over the world in India.
This is a country that believes in God or atheists who worship the idols or who have enjoyed the strategies of idol worship, all kinds of thinking, all kinds of worship, all kinds of traditional people living together.
And religion, community, thinking or tradition - whatever it may be, gives us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred Ramadan month will help in furthering this stream of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again wish you all the best.
Last time when I used Mann Ki Baat, I used a word, especially to the youngsters, I told them to do something new, to come out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age to live like this - to take a little risk, toughness.
I am glad that many people gave me feedback.
Everybody encouraged me to speak personally to me.
There's a message that I can't read everything, I can't even hear the message sent to everyone.
But I have seen everything that has come in my eyes , some are trying to learn singing , some are doing max shows in new musical instruments , some are trying to learn new things using YouTube , some are trying to learn new languages , some are learning cooking , some learning drama , some have written that they have started writing poetry .
My reading habit almost stopped.
That's why I tried to read this vacation.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I came to know how many struggles have to be fought for India's independence and how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail.
Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot of things at a very young age, has inspired me from his life.
That's why I urge you to tell you something about this today's festival.
I am happy that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history and our freedom fighters who have sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman and Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see the Cellular Jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar had written a book 'Manji Janmathe' sitting in jail.
I used to write poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small house.
How much difficulty was to bear for independence.
I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail when I read Savarkar ji's book 'Manji Janmatha'.
There's a light and sound show that is very inspiring.
There is no such state of Hindustan, there is no such linguistic person who did not enjoy the punishment of Kalapani for independence, in the Andaman jail - this Cellular Jail did not lose his life.
If you also get the opportunity to visit the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle then you will definitely go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5th.
And this year the theme of the United Nations is Connecting People to Nature.
Otherwise  Back to Basics ' .
And one is better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has often said: "One must care about world one will not see" that is, our duty is to think and take care of the world that we have not seen.
After getting very tired, the windows of the house are opened and the windows of the house are refreshed in fresh air.
When our body is formed in the five ghosts, when it is connected to that five ghost, it is from you that there is a transmission of a new life and new enthusiasm in our body.
We all saw it, but we didn't think of it, we couldn't tied it in one rope.
Then you must see that whenever you join with various natural conditions, there will be a new consciousness in you.
And that is why on June 5, we should be driven around the world to connect with nature.
We have the results of our ancestors who have worked to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
Vedas are considered to be the root of the world and the environment.
We're here to say - Motherland: Son Aham Prithviya:
The sacredness that we have in the Vedas is for our world.
Earth is our mother and we are his son.
If we remember Lord Buddha then one thing comes out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha , his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana - three were in the trees.
But we need to connect it with modern words and modern discussions.
I have news from different states at this time.
As soon as the rains arrive, a big campaign for planting trees starts in almost all the states.
Crores of trees are planted.
The world celebrates this day as World Yoga Day.
In a very short span of time, this World Yoga Day of June 21 has expanded everywhere and is joining the people.
On the one hand, many powers that differ the world are showing its distorted forms, the World Yoga Day is a major contributor to India.
Through Yoga, we have tied the world together.
The way Yoga binds the body, mind, intelligence and soul together, Yoga is binding the world together.
On the contrary, eating medicines and spending the day, Yoga has played a major role in a stress-free life.
Yoga is not just a exercise , it is healthy that is synthesis of body , mind , thought and it is possible to experience this synthesis through yoga exercise .
Two days ago, I have written letters to the government and the leaders of all the countries of the world on Yoga Day.
Last year, I announced some competitions related to yoga and announced some awards.
It's a funny proposal.
This is the third International Day of Yoga, I urge three generations of the same family to exercise together on this third International Yoga Day.
Whether it is grandmother or grandmother , parents , boys and girls should do yoga with three generations , and upload their pictures .
Yesterday, today and tomorrow - a fortunate bond of Yoga will show a new direction.
I thank you for this proposal, and I think, as we have launched a campaign with Selfie with Daughter, and have created a pleasant experience, the pictures of these three generations of yoga will illuminate the entire country and the world.
You will surely send a picture to me in the Narendra Modi App where three generations of people are doing yoga together.
It will be tomorrow, tomorrow and tomorrow, which will be a beautiful guarantee.
I invite you all.
There are still about three weeks left for International Yoga Day.
Start the habit from today.
You also propagate about three weeks irregular yoga, promote people.
This is the movement of a kind of private health care.
I invite all of you to participate in this.
Since you have given me the responsibility of working as a principal servant, and from the Red Fort I had the opportunity to speak on my first 15th August, I told me about cleanliness.
From that day till now I have visited different parts of India.
I have always seen in Modiji, TV and social media wherever you are going, everybody is paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted cleanliness as a mission in your request.
Children along with the elders have also become aware of cleanliness.
Many times small elders saw them throwing jungles .
The cleanliness that you started from the valley of Kashi has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I am going, there is a government cleanliness work, but today a festival of cleanliness begins in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, that's right.
The rest of the preparations will be made to welcome the Prime Minister, but at first it will remain clean.
It will enjoy any person who is self-reliant.
I would like to thank everyone for the emphasis on this cleanliness.
Somebody gave me a proposal.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modiji , when you go to an invitation , tell me , if you invite me then what level of cleanliness will be , how many tons of jungles will you offer me , on that basis I will fix my visit .
Dea is very good, but I have to think.
Again, there must be a movement, and as a gift, you will clean up a few tons of chains instead of other things.
How many people will we save from illness.
How big humanity will work.
Once we consider it as wealth, we will have a new way of waste management.
Young people associated with start-ups will come forward with a new plan, start-ups.
It is expected that the dry waste in these four thousand cities will be dried in blue dustbin-A and wet waste will be dried in green dustbin.
The waste of the kitchen, such as the peel of vegetables, the skin of the vegetables, the opening of eggs, the leaves of the trees - wet waste - throw in the green dustbin.
If all these things are such in agriculture, if the color of food is green then you will remember what green dustbin is to do.
And the rest of the wastes like ineffective papers , iron , card boards , glasses , clothes , plastic , polythene , rubber and other metal items are dry waste - which are not usually used in the machine , they have to be thrown into blue dustbin .
I believe that we can create a habit like this and if we have to take new steps for cleanliness then we can fulfil the dreams of Gandhiji's cleanliness.
Today, I would like to say with pride that if a person is conscious then how big a mass movement can be created.
Cleanliness work is like this.
In the past, you must have heard a news that the foul smelling Barsoba beach of Mumbai has become a clean, clean Barsoba beach today.
It has not been suddenly, a citizen has worked hard for 80-90 weeks to change the picture of Barsoba Beach, and thousands of tons of waste has been removed and the Barsoba beach has been made clean, clean and beautiful.
And Versova Residents Volunteer has been responsible for this.
One person, Mr. Afroz Shah, joined the work with all his strength since October 2015, gradually, many more people joined this work and it took the form of a mass movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this purpose.
He was the first Indian who was awarded the Champions of the Earth Award.
I came to know that the local women have given the highest leadership to this task.
They have taken torchs to create awareness among the people and they have inspired everyone in every street and every household.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir for a beautiful launch by open defecation free.
My dear countrymen, the work of the present government for the last three years has been continuously discussed in the press for the last 15 days, in various television channels and social media.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of a chief servant.
All sections of the society have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I would like to thank all those who have given critical and important feedbacks, to get the opportunity to improve their misconceptions, misconceptions etc.
For a conscious nation, this discussion is very important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am a common citizen like you and I have the same effect in the minds of a common citizen as well as in the minds of a common man.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As a common man, as a common citizen, it has a special effect on my mind, this event encouraged me.
I'm grateful to Akbar Sahib.
Let us all move forward in this environment with love for nature.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And there are many things that the curiosity of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation to do something great, the sympathy of the elders.
Every time the inputs for Mann Ki Baat are analyzed by the government.
What is the suggestion, what is the complaint, what is the feeling of people etc.
The nature of the people is to advise the others.
On the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, then do it immediately.
But when I tried to see these with care, I became impossible.
Most of the people have sent suggestions and tried to reach me, who have actually done something in their lives.
They have tried to do some good work according to their wisdom, energy, capabilities and opportunities.
And when I understood that, I felt that these suggestions are not simple.
It's from the serpentines' feelings.
Some people feel that when they are working and working, these things are coming up, then if they listen to them, they can create a broader form and it can benefit many people.
Not only this, whenever I mention something, I remember these things and I am very happy.
I have never imagined that in our country, especially the younger generation has been working on this matter for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some social organisations have been working on this subject but I know that the youngsters of my country are also working on this matter.
Many sent me video.
There are many places where the bread bank is running.
People collect bread from themselves in the bread bank, collect vegetables, and collect all the deficiencies for themselves.
Those who are giving it feel good, and those who don't even feel small.
This is an example of how the society works through cooperation.
Today is the last day of April.
1st May, Gujarat and Maharashtra were recognized as States.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two States have made efforts to achieve new goals of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
And both the states continue to inspire the great men and their lives in every field of society.
On the occasion of the inauguration of both the states, we should make a pledge to reach the heights of our state, our citizens, our society, our city, our family, after 75 years of independence in 2022.
This resolution should be planned to work out, and the cooperation of all citizens should be further enhanced.
It is time for us to experience the hot weather in our country in March-April.
When I was advising people in Mann Kiwat, I used to advise people about what should be done in this heat.
These things are prevalent, nothing is new, but it is a matter of re-imagination at a particular time.
And I saw that the kids of the family are doing this very well.
Once they understand why these waters should be filled, then ten times a day they have water in the pot or not.
And the birds see if they're here.
I think this game is going on, but it's a wonderful way to really sympathize the boys.
In our country, we spend our lives together with animals and birds and their colors, yet we should put a lot of emphasis on their collective efforts to conserve them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru of Daudi Bohra Samaj was completed 100 years.
He was alive for 103 years.
And for his 100th anniversary, the Bohra community launched a big campaign to save the climbers through Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to launch this campaign.
Around thousands of bird feeders spread them in the corner of the world.
This campaign has taken place in Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I got so busy that I forgot to give some water to those who come to my house during the summer days.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
I sometimes feel that some of our young people enjoy living from the comfort zone.
Their parents have grown into their hometops.
Some people pass through extreme complications, but most people comfortzone this life.
Now the test is over, many plans have been planned to enjoy the holidays.
It's very funny to get hot in all the summers.
But I want to talk about how to take your holidays as a friend.
I believe some people will certainly work on my words and tell me.
Sometimes there is a distinction between watching something on TV, reading in books or reading in acquaintances and feeling itself.
Whether the test is positive, it's like getting out of the comfortzone.
We are a middle-class family, a happy family.
Friends, Have you ever thought that without preserving the seats, we travel 24 hours in the second class room of the train.
I don't tell you to repeat it, but do it once or twice.
In the evening, with your footballs, volleyballs or other sports equipment, we move to a very poor settlement.
Play with those poor boys yourself, you will see that you will feel that you have never enjoyed this game in life before.
The children who live such a life in the society will have the opportunity to play with you. Do you think that there will be a big change in the lives of those children
This experience will tell you a lot.
Many voluntary organizations are working on this service.
Sometimes several memorial camps are organised because of personality development, there is a lot of development in this.
If you are enjoying Samar camps, do personality development courses, you go free of cost to those people of the society who are deprived of these subjects, teach them what you have learnt.
How to do these things, you can learn.
We reflect that technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six people in the same house together, but the difference between them has increased so much as imagined.
Everyone is busy with new technologies.
Staying together is also a reform, unity is a power.
Secondly, I want to tell you about skills, don't you want to learn new things
We try to make good results, we lose ourselves, we get admitted to some coaching class in the vacation, we are worried about further examinations.
Sometimes you're afraid, our younger generation is not getting robots.
A little emphasis can be made to improve skills.
You can try to spend your time away from technology - somebody learns the vagayatras, somebody learns Tamil, Telugu, Tamil, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages - how many diversities are there in our country - somebody around us will get friends.
If you don't know how to swim, swim, swim, swim, it may not be a good picture, but you can try to draw something on the paper.
You want to learn to drive a car, sometimes you want to learn to drive auto-rickshaws
You see this is a new experiment, its skills will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the one-time tied life.
Get out of the family life, do something, friends.
This is the opportunity to make life.
You think all the exams are over, I'll learn only when I go to the new career, but there's no chance.
Then you will get involved in any other problem, so I will tell you, if you learn your wisdom of learning your magic, at least learn its magic.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know something you don't know, you'll definitely benefit.
The human quality in you will be awakened and there will be a lot of opportunities for improvement.
I say with my experience that we cannot imagine how much we can learn and understand the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
But whenever we go, the customs there, and the way we go there, we see, understand, discuss and ask people, then the joy of seeing that new place increases.
Stay at the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three-four days.
You can learn a lot from this.
Where did you go
You share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is almost getting rid of cash transactions.
They need cash.
They're starting to believe in digital currency.
But if you refer to someone else or neglect somebody else and that new person thrice does the transaction of money, you get ten rupees to do this work.
Your account will collect ten rupees from the government.
If you get 20 people in a day, you'll get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businesses can also get income, students can also get income.
This scheme is on 14th October, this will be your distinction in building a Digital India.
Now the red wind has gone, so nobody can say that the red wind in the mind may have emerged.
I've got an interesting phone call.
This phone has also expressed the apprehension, but this phone shows that the common man does not like it at all, they used to feel a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I want to talk about the government's Red Bacon Light Ban.
I don't have to get stuck in the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for me.
I want to thank you for this theory.
Thank you for the cleanliness of Dadagiri of PPs.
Lalbati is a part of the government system in the train.
But we have to try to remove this feeling from our mind.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that our history, our culture and heritage have to be remembered again and again.
This will inspire us to store energy.
This year, we are rearing the Sahasra Year of Saint Ramanujacharya.
In other countries of the world, centenary celebrations are very important, but India is such an ancient nation that we have the opportunity to remember thousands of years or even more old memories.
Thousands of years ago, he took the movement with the authority to enter the temple and succeeded.
We are so fortunate that some or the other great man has been born in the country to deny the faults of society.
We can inspire him to reflect the energy that is a source of social unity in the celebration of the Sahastrama Jayanti of Santramanujacharya.
The Government of India is publishing a postage stamp in memory of Saints tomorrow, 1st May.
I remember Santramanujacharya with respect, I salute.
Dear countrymen, there is another significance of 1st May tomorrow.
In some places in the world, this day is celebrated as Labour Day.
And whenever we talk about Labour Day, when we talk about labour and labourers then I will remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people may know that we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the facilities and facilities that the labourers have received today.
Baba Saheb's role in labour welfare is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramanujacharya, I also remember the great saints and socialists of Karnataka in the twelfth century Jagatguru Buseshwar.
In the twelfth century, he talked about labour and labour in Kannada.
He spoke in Kannada: Kai Kave Kailas.
This means that through hard work you can reach Shiva's Alaikalas.
Today, when I talk to the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Thangri.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Buddha Purnima a few days later.
All the Buddhist religions of the world celebrate the same day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha in the life of Mrs. Ashoka is a unique symbol.
It is particularly in our neighbouring countries.
May the neighbouring countries of India continue to collaborate and develop.
Several projects are underway internationally.
On 5th May, India will launch South Asia Satellite.
This satellite will help in economic and other developmental sectors of South Asian countries.
These include mapping of natural resources, telemedicines, education, IT connectivity and people-to-people contacts, and this satellite of South Asia will help us progress all over the world.
An important step by India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia is an invaluable gift, an example of our commitment to South Asia.
I extend my best wishes to all those countries of South Asia who are associated with this South Asia Satellite Project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
Most of the families in every corner of the country are busy examining their children.
Those who have finished the examination have some comfort and where the examination is going on, those families are still under pressure.
But at a time I will say that last time I listen to the words I had spoken to the people of Mann Ki Baat.
You will definitely use those things at the time of the test.
Today, March 26.
Bangladesh Independence Day on 26th March.
Historical fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangabandhu.
Today, on this great day, I extend my best wishes to the citizen brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day.
And I wish Bangladesh progress, development, and Bangladeshi people will also assure that India is a strong partner, a good friend, and we will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, the heritage of both our countries.
The National Music of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very attractive fact about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first Asian person to be honored with the Christian Award but also the British gave him the nighthood.
And when the British took the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who came to fight and at that time when a child of twelve years had a profound impact on this incident.
The brutal murder of Jallian Wala Bagh brought a new orientation in the life of the boy who walked in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat is our beloved, inspired by all of us - martyr Bhagat Singh.
Three days before this day, on March 23, the British hung Bhagat Singh and his companions - Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all know that the incident of 23rd March - Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , the satisfaction of serving Mother India - there was no fear of death .
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
And these three heroes are still inspired by us.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three youths.
They've been imprisoned in jail, they've been fined, but they've been worried about what they could do with them.
And that's why on March 24, where it was to be hanged, it was 23rd.
It's hiding that can't be seen normally.
And after that their deaths were brought to Punjab today and the British quietly burnt.
Several years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the trembling of that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to go to Punjab , you must go to the tomb of Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , Bhagat Singh , Janani and Batukeshwar Dudh .
This is the time when the intensity of freedom, its intensity and humility grew.
On the one hand, the heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru inspired the youth of the Armed Revolution.
On the other hand, just 100 years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had Satyagraha in Champaran on 10th April, 1917.
This year, the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha is completed.
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhi Bhavadhara and Gandhi style have been seen for the first time in Champaran.
This was a transformation in the entire movement of independence, especially from the perspective of the struggle.
This festival, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the labourers of the factory in Ahmedabad, and all these showed a profound impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thinking and style of work.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he inspired the country by visiting a small village in Bihar.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha based on the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine a man who came back to Hindustan in 1915, worked only for two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was the same where Mahatma Gandhi's organizational strategy , the power to know the nerves and stars of Indian society , through Mahatma Gandhi's own behaviour , the poverty against the British administration , the creation of a single ignorant person for fighting , inspiring and bringing him to the field of fighting .
Therefore, we can experience the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think of Gandhiji a hundred years ago, that is Champaran Satyagraha Gandhi, then it is a matter of deep study for a person to enter the part of public life that Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of deep study.
We can learn from him how to work hard, how to work hard and how Gandhi did it.
And that was a time when the Tawad Tawad leaders, whose names we heard were Rajendrababu, Acharya Kripalani, Gandhi sent everyone to the village.
On one hand filling up the jail and on the other hand handing it to yourself in constructive work .
There was a marvellous balance between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What can be the meaning of Satyagraha, what can be unemployed, what can be the meaning of unemployment in front of such a large empire - not only with words, but through a successful epidemic, Gandhi wrote a complete new idea.
The untiring effort to show something for the country, for the society will fulfil the dreams of those great men who have laid down their lives for the freedom of the country.
And in the 21st century there are no Indians who do not want to change, who do not want to participate in the progress of the country.
This desire for the progress of the 125 crore Indians will sell the seeds of a New India - New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
It is our birthplace that is the service of our nation Ratnagarva and Jan Sevai Prabhu.
If we look at this thinking together, then we can understand how big it is.
Discussions on the subjects of India are very natural and inevitable.
But it is also true that if the entire countrymen make a resolution and take steps to realise it, then the dream of New India can be successful.
It is not necessary that all the work will be done in the budget or public expenditure.
If every citizen makes a resolution that they follow the traffic rules , perform their duty with dedication , stop the use of petrol - diesel at least one day in a week , then through this small step we have New II .
I would like to see the dream of India to be realized and I would like to say that everybody should follow his citizens' religion and perform his duty.
This is the beginning of a New India.
By 2022, India is going to be the seventeenth year of independence.
I urge you to come, embrace and resolve your lives and participate in this journey of 'Swaraj to Suraj'.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you.
BHIM App has started two and a half months ago, but almost 1. 5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot imagine that you can become a big participant of the country's service, you can make yourself a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organised for public education and awareness.
Approximately 12. 5 lakh people have received special awards for the beneficiaries and seventy thousand people have received special awards for the traders.
Let us participate in this effort to reduce the use of cash transactions and notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that whenever I want your advice for Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of opinion.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think it is important for the common man to understand the cleanliness.
I pass through a river every day, where people pollut the river with a lot of waste.
This river is coming through the Rispna bridge and flowing through our houses .
To keep this river clean I went to Para and talked to the people , mixed , but there was no special benefit .
I would urge you to send a team here or publish it through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, You see how much a girl from Ekadash is suffering.
He's so foolish to see the dirt in the river.
I think it's a good signal.
I want 125 crore Indians to be angry with waste.
Once there is anger, dissatisfaction, hostility, we can decide on the campaign against waste.
It's a good thing that the singer has expressed his anger, has advised me and at the same time told me that he has tried a lot, but failed.
Since the Swachhta movement has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone is positively associated with it.
It has taken the form of a movement.
The hatred of waste is increasing gradually.
Whether people are aware, actively participants, movements, it has its own significance.
This movement is possible in a holistic way.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness that has come among the youth of the country, among the children, among the students, among the youth, indicates a good result.
Today, I would like to tell the people of the country who are listening to the singing of the singer in my Mann Ki Baat that the singing of the singer should be spoken by all of us.
Half of you don't even get in the stomach, and leave it there and get it out.
Sometimes we saw how bad we waste the unclaimed food we left.
Have you ever imagined that if you don't waste, then how much this food can fill the stomach of the poor people.
There's nothing to explain about it separately.
Normally when mother feeds small children in our house then she says that take as much food as possible .
There are some efforts in this regard, but in spite of this, sadness in this regard is a reflection of social disorder.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if there are savings, the family will also get financial benefits.
Things are good for the society , but this is such that family will also get benefit from it .
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youngsters of our country work like this.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in all the states of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't waste food.
We'll take as much as we eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate a little empty , keep a little empty stomach also .
When the matter of health comes then tell me , April 7 is ' World Health Day ' .
The United Nations has set the goal of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This time, the United Nations has given special attention to the depression on the 7th April World Health Day.
According to a hypocrisy, more than 150 crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many of our surroundings are victims of this disease, but we don't understand it, and maybe we feel hesitant to talk about it openly.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that it will not be able to get rid of it.
He starts getting rid of a psychological complex.
First thing is depression - without suppressing him and expressing him.
With your friends, parents, brothers and sisters, openly tell the teacher what is happening inside you.
Have you ever thought why he's doing this
Be sure, these are the first symptoms of depression.
If you want to keep yourself away from the middle of everyone, take care of him - don't let him be alone.
Let those with whom or whom he likes to stay with.
Hy-Hullod, in the funny words, encourage him to speak openly, find out what his skull is hidden in your mind.
Disease like diabetes reduces physical weakness, depression reduces the consciousness of people, cuts courage, reduces the strength of fighting in lifestyle, destroys all our lives.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start solving other problems with the mind of service.
If you can meet yourself with others, you can serve and if you can do it selflessly, see if your mind becomes lighter by unnecessarily.
Yoga is the best way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is an extremely effective way to get rid of psychological disorders, to get rid of tensions and to get rid of happiness.
International Yoga Day is celebrated on 21st June every year.
On the occasion of 'International Yoga Day', if you have to advise you, send me all the ideas through my mobile app, show the way.
As much as you can write poems and songs about yoga, write so that there can be an impression among the common man.
Now I will tell my mothers and sisters about the healthcare.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
During the pregnancy of working women , during the pregnancy of delivery and after delivery the maternal leave which was given at the time of delivery was 12 weeks earlier .
In this context, only two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, the country will have resources.
New Year Festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, New Year in Andhra-Karnataka is celebrated in Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Ayodhya, Sanvastar Puja, Jud Sheetal in Mithila, Bihar and Satwani in Magadh.
Large countries are full of diversity in India.
Congratulations to all of you on the New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's shouting brings a joke of pleasure.
Not only the flowers, the fruits in the tree branches also shine in the sunlight.
The summer season also sees mango crowns.
Likewise, in the farming fields of mustard yellow flowers are expected to grow.
The red flower of Palash indicates the arrival of Holi.
My Khasru has given a very beautiful description of this time of climate change.
He wrote: The jungle grew up in the jungle, the mustard blooms, the plass blooms, the cockel calls, the Kuhu-Kuhu.
People also enjoy that when the color of joy in nature, when the color of joy is touched in the form of rituals.
Spring-Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals make human lives colorful.
And so he said that I should talk about 104 satellite launches and interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji thanked you for reminding you of the pride of India.
Be it fighting poverty, protecting themselves from diseases, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information technology and science have proved their role.
On February 15, 2017, a glorious day of Indias national life.
Our scientists have raised our heads before the world.
And we know that in a few years ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented projects.
ISRO has recently established a World Record on Space Campaign after its success in sending Mars Mission Mangalyaan to Mars on Mars.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together.
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th PSLV Sustainable Launch.
This is not just ISRO, but a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISROs cost-effective Affordable Space Programme has been a wonder for the world and has appreciated the success of Indian scientists in an open mind.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters will know how much water resources are there in our country and how it should be used and how it should be taken care of.
We've sent some pictures to the satellite room.
It's starting its work.
It is also a matter of great pleasure for us that our young scientists, our women scientists, who have led these campaigns.
This rare collaboration of youth and women is a pride for ISROs success.
I compliment the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
They have always kept the objective of using space science for the common man, for the service of the nation and are creating new achievements every day.
We appreciate our scientists and their entire team as much as we appreciate.
Shobhaji has put one more question and it is related to Indias security.
India has successfully tested the Balisticinterceptor Missile in defence sector.
Interception technology, Baliyan has successfully successfully halted the missile from the soil at a time of its experimental flight.
This is an important achievement in defence sector.
When I see new technologies, we see some new scientific success, we are happy.
And asking has played a big role in the development of human life.
And those intellectuals who don't allow him to keep him in the form of a question, they also send questions, find new questions and create new questions.
Asked for new inventions.
They do not calm down until the answer is received.
And if we see the stream of development of human life for thousands of years, then we can say that there is no complete impediment in the stream of development of human life.
Full sterilisation is impossible.
The efforts to know the universe, the laws of creation, the minds of the human beings are continuing.
New science, new technologies are born from among them.
And every technology, every new form of science, gives a new age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about science, we talk about the hard work of scientists, I remember that once I have said that the younger generation should be attracted to science.
Many scientists are required in the country.
Todays scientists will launch a permanent transformation in the lives of the next generation.
In view of the requirements of the common man, when science researches, inventions and innovations, and how the innovation works for the common man, then science becomes a great man.
This is where I have seen an innovation to help our poor fishermen.
All such innovations have come from this competition.
Different services are also becoming rapid.
Technology has become an integral part of life.
Indias digital transactions are increasing.
In particular, the youth are removing digital payments from their handholding mobile.
I think it's a good symptom.
Laki Grahak Yojana, DG DhanBaar Yojana, is getting a huge boost.
About two months ago, 15 thousand people are awarding Rs. 1,000 per day from these two schemes.
Many have received Rs. 1 lakh prizes for this scheme.
More than four thousand traders have received 50 thousand rupees.
Shri Santosh of Mysore has expressed happiness in the Narendra Modi App that he has received Rs. 1,000 prizes in Laki Consumer Scheme.
Then, Mr. Santosh, I think we should share with you.
I like to know that Santosh ji, your name and work both have made us very happy.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become an Ambassador of Laki Grahak Yojana.
The passengers of the train are also keenly aware of the digital system and many more have started taking part in the digital system.
In Maharashtra, a young fellow companion from Puja, Nemad, how the use of RuPay card and e-Wallet is being done among a schoolchildren's family and he was happy to discuss this with his friends.
One lakh rupees awards are important for him and he is also encouraging others to take it into a mission mode.
This work plays an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
A memorable day.
A few days ago, the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar fell.
Remembering him, you also learn to upload at least 125 BHIMs.
Teach how to deal with it.
Therefore, I would like to say that we have to strengthen the foundation stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
We have to reach the BHIM App to 125 crore people by going to the house.
The movement that has been going on for the last two-three months is being achieved in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village is enhancing the economic pace of the country.
Today I want to tell you a joyful thing.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard to fill the food storage.
This year, due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, the maximum production of rice has been achieved.
Everything indicates that our farmers have broken the old records.
This year, the way the crops have flown into the fields, every day we celebrate the festival of Pongal or Vaishakhi.
This year, more than two thousand seven crore tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country.
Our last record of farmers was eight percent more than that.
It's an unprecedented achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of the country have heard about the poor and about 200 lakh hectares of pulses have been cultivated.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of the country by the farmers.
I am extremely grateful to the farmers and sisters of my country who have worked hard and have produced record pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, some programmes are being run by the government, the society, the organizations and the organizations for cleanliness.
Everybody is aware of cleanliness in a way or not.
Seminars are being held in the closed houses in Varangal in the state of Telangana and the importance of cleanliness is directly highlighted.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organised in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and officers showed themselves how to utilize the TwinPit Toilet.
They also showed how comfortable the toilets of this new technique are, and there is no other difficulty or shrinking mental obstacle till it is evacuated.
We also do small sanitation work, like we can clean the holes of the toilet.
A Standard Twin PitToilet is filled in about five to six years for the family of six members.
Our farmers are well aware of NPK.
Various Government Departments and Parties celebrate sanitation in different ways.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
On the second hand of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does a significant job, the entire country gets a new energy, the self-confidence increases.
We all welcomed the success of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.
In this month's Bland T-20 World Cup, India has enhanced the pride of the country as the World Champion for the second time, losing Pakistan.
I once again congratulate all the players of this team.
The country is proud of the success of our Divyang friends.
I don't always mean that Divyang brothers and sisters are compassionate, determined, courageous and unbreakable.
We can always learn something new from them.
Whether it is in sports or space science, our country's girls are not lagging behind in any field.
They have moved on foot and are making the country proud of their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in the Asian Ragvisions 1982.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is progressing at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government project, it has now become a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this scheme.
All the burning flames that are being obtained from every corner of the country are compulsory to think about the common man and people are changing their mindset for years.
It is a matter of great joy when it is reported that the festival is celebrated on the occasion of the birth of a daughter.
Such positive thinking towards the daughter-in-law paves the way for social recognition.
I came to know that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriage by running a special campaign.
More than 175 Child Marriage Allowances have been closed so far.
More than 55-60 thousand bank accounts have been opened in Sukna Samridhi Yojana.
In Madhya Pradesh, under the Har Ghar Dask scheme, every village has a campaign to educate daughters in every household.
With the help of Apna Kidya UpnaVidyalaya, Rajasthan is campaigning to re-enroll those who leave school without finishing their education and encouraging them to write.
New imaginations have also been linked to it.
This has been changed according to the local requirements.
You are actively connected to it.
I know a lot from you.
What is happening in the world, the thinking of the poor people of the village is reaching me.
I am extremely grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors decorated our climate, economic and social systems in such a way that there is no laxity in social life.
In the last few days, we celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Shri Krishna is such a person who has created innovation, inspiration, innovation, innovation and innovation in every festival, even after thousands of years, which is the past of our imagination.
He can still become an example of solutions to any problem and inspire.
Anyone who can find solutions to the present problem from Sri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, it can also be said that Sarthi is willing to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes the mountains get up and sometimes they stop eating bricks.
Today, when I'm talking to you, I'm moving towards two faces.
One Sudarshan Chakradhi Mohan, the other is Charkadhari Mohan.
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan left the river Yamuna on the banks of the river and settled on the banks of Dwarka, Gujarat and spent his last day in Delhi on the banks of Yamuna, born on the banks of the sea.
At that time, a few thousand years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan used his own intellect, duties, courage and thinking to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the shore of Porbandar, which we called Kirti Mandir today, in that small house, on October 2, 1869, a person was born not just a single age, who had shown a new path to human history, established a new excellence.
Mill's labourers who were not given enough labourers served them.
He considered the service of the poor, the helpless, the sick, the hungry and the hungry as one of the most duties of life.
He himself served the leprosy victims to prove the wrong beliefs among the common man about leprosy to inspire others.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to leave for helping him.
He not only emphasized the need for service but also knew the importance of self-reliance in service.
The meaning of the word 'Seva' happens only if it is done with joy then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the real joy of 'Sant Sukhay' is also inherent in service.
We can easily understand this by studying the life of Gandhiji.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity were the only thoughts.
African Phoenix Farm: Whether it is Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha, he emphasized the community mobilization in social development in a moral spirit everywhere.
It is my privilege to pay homage to the venerable Mahatma Gandhiji in various fields of work.
Gandhiji used to give importance to the spirit of service as well as to the organizational energy.
We want to use both social service and social integration, community service and community mobilization.
Come and go, can we admit
There will be no obstacles in the minds of those who work in the minds of those who will be able to get a unique joy if they work in the minds of all kinds of dedication and goodwill.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news on this occasion.
In this, Haripura panels were specially fascinating.
You remember that there was a congressional session in Haripura in Gujarat, where Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in the history of the British Presidential election.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura Session of 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then President of Shantiniketan Kavvan, Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India through art and this artwork session should be displayed during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artificial architecture enhances our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
This discussion of his art has given immortality to the Constitution as well as Nandlal Bose.
Nandlal Bose inspected the villages around Haripura and then constructed a chart canvas with rural India.
This valuable art of art was discussed in Venice.
And once I urge every Indian to make a pledge for Gandhijis 150th anniversary.
We need to do something for the country, for the society, for the other.
This will be our beautiful, true and true tribute to Bapu.
Descendants of Mother India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have launched the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from 11th September.
This time we have to put special emphasis on plastic.
There is enthusiasm among all the people of the society for this campaign.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have put a placard in a shop store, where it is written that Khariddar brings his bag along.
It can also save the money and also show its own partnership to protect the environment.
This time on October 2, when Bapu will celebrate 150 years, he will not only dedicate to the Open Defecation Free India, the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic will be laid.
I would like to appeal to all the communities of the society, to every village, to the inhabitants of the city, to join hands and pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated in a way to free this Mother India from plastic junk.
On 2nd October, as a special day.
It can be recycled.
It can also be used as fuel.
There is no need to see here for inspiration, no one bigger than Gandhiji can be inspiring.
My dear countrymen, our culture is well-known, a gem of knowledge.
Today, I would like to touch an important issue through a composite address, it is a matter of prior writing, but it still has a vast importance.
The fools call the stone a gem.
Our culture has a lot of glory for food.
We have also transformed the knowledge of food grains into science.
We all need sustainable and nutritious food, especially for women and newborns.
People are fighting against malnutrition in a new and entertaining manner.
On the day of harvesting the crops, Anganwadi servicers collected one fist from everyone.
These food grains were used for making hot food for children and women.
The person who donates this will become a conscious citizen and a social worker.
After this, he dedicated himself to this objective and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, the Annaprashan programme should provide complete food to the child so that there is awareness in the minds of people.
This is a very important initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people celebrate hostage meals.
If a family has a birthday, auspicious day, a memorial day, then the members of the family make tasty, nutritious food and go to Anganwadi, school and the family members themselves feed their children and share their joy in everyone, which enhances joy.
This is a unique mix of service and joy.
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight a fruitful fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, malnutrition has affected the poor and wealthy families.
Poshan Abhiyan will be celebrated across the country in September.
You will definitely be associated with this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can save two persons from malnutrition, it means our country will also be able to protect from malnutrition.
This time when I am thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of more questions on this matter and that is why it happened.
For the last few weeks, wherever I have gone and those who have met, the theme is Man Vs Wild.
With this episode, I have not only been able to unite with the youth of all the parts of the world, but I have never thought that I will have such a place in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought of how diverse the youth of our country and the world are.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
That's what I feel.
Tiger, Lion, Life-creation I'm amazed how much people can be encouraged.
I firmly believe that people now want to know the steps taken in India regarding climate justice and clean environment.
Is this later edited
Look, there's no secret.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm releasing this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say that Hindi but he used to listen to English and that's why the conversation was very easy and that's what the technology is.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to Nature Wildlife, Nature and Wildlife affected areas.
I said before, I'm telling you again, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will spread.
On 15th August, I requested all of you from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places of India will go to 15 places for 100 tourism, see, discuss, take family and spend some time there.
Your life, your feelings will spread.
Last month, it was fortunate to release the country's Tiger Census.
Do you know the number of tigers in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was very difficult.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
A resolution was taken by expressing concern over the reduction in the number of tigers in the world.
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India where we have achieved the goals very fast.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reserves has increased.
When I was telling the stories of tigers, I remembered the lion of the Gir forest in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the residence of the lion in the jungle of Gir became narrow.
Their numbers were declining.
We made a lot of innovations in Gir.
We decided to appoint women guards in 2007.
Infrastructure can help improve tourism industry.
In the context of nature and wildlife, we only focus on conservation or conservation.
Now we have to think about the sensitivity of our conservation.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
The brightest speech of this young Indian saint was awakened among the humankind across the world.
While the later India was in the world court of compassion, the world was forced to discover a New India in the words of great personality Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let us build the power that Swami Vivekananda had seen in India.
On this occasion, we are going to start Fit India Movement across the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a magnificent expedition for the elderly and the elderly.
But today I don't know about this in detail.
Wait for August 29.
Totally Dedicated Plastics on 2nd October.
With all our strength, we will join the campaign to keep the house and around it plastic free.
I believe that this campaign will create a flame on social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolution, a new energy.
I waited for your messages and advice.
May the mantra of inner joy and service illuminate our journey.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy in a sense of reform that makes the future generation aware of democracy and responsibility of democracy.
However, in our country, the deliberations on citizens' duties and the rights of citizens should be discussed, the more intense and depth should be discriminated, the more widespread should be discussed.
I hope that at every level, at every moment, the more emphasis is given on the right, the more emphasis is given on duty.
Indias democracies can move on both the paths of right and duty.
Yesterday, January 30, our venerable Babapur Punya Tithi.
We pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country at 11 o'clock in the morning on January 30.
We should become a common habit of paying homage to the nation as a united society, as a nation, on January 30, 11.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who have been awarded the Bravery Index Awards and their family members.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Saurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vehicle Seva Medal.
I would like to appeal to youngsters, especially those who are very active on social media, can you do one thing
This time, whoever has been awarded this honour, find them on the Internet and write commendations and send them to your friends.
When we know about their courage, bravery and valour in detail, we are proud and motivated as we are surprised.
On one hand, when all of us were happy with the news of joy and joy on 26th January, our soldiers in Kashmir who are steadfast in the security of the country, have lost their lives due to the devastation of the country.
I pay homage and homage to these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am constantly listening to Manki Baat.
January, February, March, April, all these months are the month of examination in every family.
One-and-a-half or two children in the world are tested, but the entire family is under the pressure of examination.
A very strange psychological atmosphere is seen in every world in the stress of the family, in the stress of the students, in the stress of the teacher.
And I have always been convinced that we should come out of this and that's why today I want to talk to the young friends in detail with Espark.
When I announced this thing, many teachers, parents, students sent me a message, sent questions, advised, wrote about pain, mentioned stress and after seeing that I felt that today I would like to share with you.
I sent a message on the telephone from creation.
Anyway, the question arises, but the same question is in your mind.
The test should be a joyful explanation.
It should be a festival of hope and zeal that work has been done throughout the year.
You have to decide that you think it's a pressure, no pleasure.
And when the festival takes place, the best in us comes out.
At the time of the festival, the society envisages its energy.
During the examination, there should be an atmosphere of festival in the family and friends around Para and Para.
The entire family should play the role of your own in achieving this festival as a team and see how fast it changes.
It is true that from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months are just tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, in their own ways, in their own ways, in their own traditions, in the environment of their own families, they make it a festival.
And so I'll tell you smile more square more.
And you have seen that when you're happy, you're relaxed, you're relaxed, and when you're relaxed, you're relaxed with a year old.
You remember the whole scene of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it seems that we can't look at the exams with the right terrorism.
I think the test should be a question of life and death.
The test means that you've been studying for a year.
J.
A glorious example of Kalam.
He wanted to join the Air Force but was ungrateful.
Imagine that if he had become desperate after this failure, would he have gone to the forefront, would India have found such a big scientist
This has not only increased the competition among the students but also increased the tension.
I would like to know your views on the present situation and future of the education system.
What will be your true path in life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and determination.
You think he's a good doctor, that's what you need to go to him.
Whenever you go to a Nameukil when you face a big case, do you find his marksheet
You have seen his experience, his knowledge and success.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number becomes in the right way.
Analyze that whenever you run for numbers, you have found the easiest way, you have focused on certain things, but you are disappointed when you face any problem outside this hole.
And that's why sometimes it happens to be very successful in the examination and we face failure in our life.
Richa has raised one more subject, it is a competition.
It's a big psychological field.
We can give examples of Chinese Tendulkar in this regard.
Friends, If you are going to examine every aspect of life, especially when you are going to examine, then you can take care of it if you used to give two hours to examine it for three hours.
When we thought of getting up earlier, it was too late, can we get up at the right time
Shri S.
This way he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the tenth test, but if she didn't get help, I wouldn't have been able to pass the CBSE test.
Beautiful-ji, you're right.
You must have noticed that the number of women who asked me and advised me is higher.
If you learn to accept once, many problems will be solved there.
If you don't admit it, it opens the way to solve this problem.
Hope makes the road difficult.
Acknowledging the present situation creates an opportunity to open new solutions.
So accept what you have.
Look, you'll be free of weight.
We talk about the weight of the school bags for small children, but sometimes I believe that parents' expectations are more than the school bags of aspirational children.
Several years ago, because of heart attack, a well-known person was in the hospital.
In fact, we go to a sick person and create a fear in his mind about illness.
I would like to tell parents that sometimes we live with young people.
Have you ever imagined that in the days of examination, I give a smile to the children.
You'll see the situation will change.
I got a very funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to tell his name.
If you hear the phone details, you can understand why he doesn't want to publish his name.
He said, Namaskar, Prime Minister, I have done some work in my film that I cannot tell my name.
I tried to copy once in my childhood.
I wasted myself for a long time to imagine what I would take for this purpose.
I could get the same number if I spent that time for studying.
When I tried to get the passers, I got caught and many friends around me had trouble.
I'm telling you the same thing.
So where will you reach
Remember, you yourself are finding your own ways, meaning creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and using creative power to find ways to duplicate.
If I talk about sports at the time of examination, then everyone will say - how Prime Minister
Because the common man thinks that the students will be careless in studying when they are concerned about sports.
Besides the brain, the rest of the body should have the right activity.
If you take a brake for five minutes, you will feel that you're having a lot of mind.
I don't know if everyone likes it, but I told me about my trust.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
How long did he ask me to sleep
I want to know, brother, are you a doctor
He said, Oh, no, you don't say, it's related to your throat to give this speech.
If you're okay, you'll get your lunch card rest.
I didn't think of my sleep and my throat before.
He gave me a simple hatch.
Don't do that even if you forget, your feelings will be dissatisfied with me.
Otherwise, when the marksheet comes, parents will be able to see my image instead of you.
If you're lying down, you'll be supposed to work.
Sports also play a funny role in keeping mind, intelligence and body active.
Let's go with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is celebrating 40 years on 1st February this year.
On this occasion, I congratulate all the personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their duty towards the country.
Our Coast Guard has achieved its pride in the world's four best Coast Guard Forces in collaboration with 126 warships and 62 aircraft built in our own country.
Keeping this commitment of the Coast Guard in mind, our Coast Guard Forces are always waiting for all adversities to safeguard the maritime boundaries of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard Force had planned to keep the coasts clean along with their mainstreams and thousands of common people were involved in this work.
Our women pilot officers in the Coast Guard are also transparent in handling Hovercraft.
Spring Rituraj
Saraswati is worshipped in Basant-Panchami.
For the prayer of education, we have to be blessed for worship.
Not only education but also a festival of inspiration for bravery.
Mere Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
I extend my warm greetings to the people of the country on the occasion of this spring-panchami.
My dear countrymen, ASHAN has filled the Mann Ki Baat programme with a lot of detailed thinking.
Last month, after my Mann Ki Baat address, it has been heard in regional languages.
This effort has achieved great success.
The countrymen have written letters from far and wide.
I convey my best wishes to them for this self-motivated effort of ASHAN.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to all of you in Christmas.
Today is the day to serve, sacrifice and compassion in your life.
Relief is not beneficial for the poor, but our recognition for them.
There's a very popular story about this.
Lord Jesus once stood by a temple treasure.
A lot of rich people came and donated a lot.
Immediately after that, a poor widow came and donated two copper money.
On the one hand, two copper donors donate no money.
The birth anniversary of Mrs. Madan Mohan Malavya ji, awakened by determination and self-confidence in the Indian people, had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birth anniversary, I pay homage to him.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate several developmental works in the penance of Malavyaji in Banaras.
I also laid the foundation stone of Mahamamati Madan Mohan Malavya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
Cancer Centre is being built for the entire region, not only in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh, but also in the benefit of the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Our countrys heads have risen in the field of nuclear energy led by him.
Atal ji has set an ideal in the role of a party leader, a parliamentarian, a minister or a Prime Minister.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
Several memories are visible in front of the eyes.
This morning, when I tweeted, I shared an old video, how Atal ji's affection for a small worker would have seen this video.
As a long gift, all the people of the country are going to get the benefits of two schemes.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
To encourage this, to increase the energy of mobile banking, to make e-payment a habit, the Government of India is launching an encouraging scheme of consumers and small businesses today.
Encouraging consumers is the Laki Consumer Yojana and the name of the Business Programme, DG-Dhan Pragati Yojana.
And on 25th December, Christmas Gift, 15,000 persons will be deposited in accounts through DR.
Today, not just for a day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 persons will be awarded every day.
The gift of crores of rupees will reach lakhs of families in 100 days but they will be eligible for this gift, who are mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI
Use digital transactions, such as USSD, etc.
DG-DhanBaarYojana is for businessmen.
The businessmen will also connect themselves with this scheme, and will also connect the consumers to cashless their business.
Businessmen will also be awarded separately and there will be thousands of awards.
Those who can buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not have the benefit of this award.
With the help of USSD, poor people can sell and sell through Feature phones and ordinary phones, they will get the opportunity to get the awards.
People from rural areas can win this award by selecting them through AEPS.
Your family will also be able to teach you this way well.
This is a simple ease of sending the WhatsApp from mobile phones.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payments, how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300 per cent without cash.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this method.
This decision can be easily guessed by the businessmen.
All the traders who will provide digital exchanges, promote online payments instead of cash in their businesses will be exempted from their income.
I have known that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount on providing property taxes and trade licenses for digitalisation.
Rural Bank branches have decided that 75 of their consumers will be awarded Rs. 50,000 for at least two digital transactions from January to March.
5 lakh prizes have been announced by the Government of Assam under the Uttam Panchayat for Digi Transaction Scheme, if any village gets 100 digital transactions till 31st March, 2017.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to award Rs. 5,000 prizes to the first 10 farmers who are fully pursued digitally for buying seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate all the states that have taken such initiatives.
Interestingly, the sale of fertilizers in GNFC has increased by 27 compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, there is a significance of unorganized sector in our daily life.
Most of these people are paid in the wages, money or salary cash for work, and we know that the labourers are also discharged.
100 instead of 80 rupees, 50 rupees were given, and many other benefits including health insurance such as insurance were deprived of these workers.
But when cashless payments are made, the money gets deposited directly in the bank.
Our country is the most young country.
Technology is easy to us.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this.
Our youngsters have improved a lot through start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity, our younger generation should take as much initiatives as possible with new ideas, new technologies and new techniques in this field.
We have to join the country with full strength in the campaign to free the country from black money and financial corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people before every 'Mann Ki Baat' programme, you send your suggestions, your opinions and this time thousands of opinions have been suggested in MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
The authors of the second group, who have given importance to these things, have done such a good job, work for the good of the country, this is a sacred task, but they have given details of the kind of falsifying and how new falsifying methods are being taken against it.
Mr. Gurumani Kayobal wrote in 'My Gauv': This step is commendable for taking money for black money.
As a citizen, we are sick, but we are happy that we are cooperating in the fight against corruption.
We are playing a role in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
This feeling is coming up from all corners of the country.
We all can feel it.
In fact, these are the roots of the Agent of Change.
I would like to thank everyone for one more reason, not only have they tolerated the discomfort, but also have given a strong answer to those who are trying to mislead the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened their faces with their intellect, energy and creativity and brought the truth forward.
I salute this power of the people hundreds of years.
The people are the blessings of God, the blessings of the people.
I thank the people of the country, I salute the people for taking full zeal in this Mahayana against corruption and black money.
I wanted that there should be a detailed discussion on political parties and political funding in the Parliament as the fight against corruption and black money was going on.
Those who are roaming, there is a lot of discount for political parties - their routine is wrong.
This government is the government of the people.
On the other hand, I said on the first day - 8th, this is a great fight.
There are many more news about the news that comes from the government system from the common man.
The success we achieve is mainly due to the awareness of the people.
Can anyone imagine how much the aware citizens of our country are risking to open their faces
This fight will be very easy if you get your help.
Those who send me letters, there's a third group, a lot of people.
They say that Modiji will not stop, do not get tired, take as hard as possible steps as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of being tired.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very strictly.
This law will play its role in the coming days.
It is our primary duty for the countrymen and the people.
In the past, India has established itself with pride in many sectors in the world economy.
According to the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached the third place in 2016-18 Top Prospective Host Economy.
India has improved 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, the World Banks Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 2016 has made India a 19-page growth.
Likewise, some other reports are also showing India's rapid growth.
My dear countrymen, this time the session of Parliament has created warmth among the people of the country.
Their anger has been expressed in various ways regarding the activities of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their zeal in this regard.
But sometimes something good happens in these things, then the mind gets filled with happiness.
There has been a good work in the House of Parliament which has not been seen by the common man of the country.
Brothers and sisters, I am glad to say this thing today that a bill has been passed in Parliament for the people with disabilities that the government is taking forward the goals for the disabilities.
Our government is committed to persons with disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have made this effort more powerful when they won four medals in Para Olympics.
This win has not only enhanced the dignity of the country but has also wondered the countrymen.
Our Disabled brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, are our invaluable resources and energy.
I am glad that the passage of this law will facilitate more jobs for the disabled.
Reservation limit has been increased to four per cent in government jobs.
The Act provides for education, facilities and complaints for the disabled.
The government has enacted this new law according to the idea of the United Nations.
For the first time, there have been a set up for persons with disabilities to get appropriate opportunities and justice.
Thalassemia, perkinson's diseases and vendors have also been linked to this category.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been news from the field of sports that we all feel proud.
It is natural for us to be proud of being an Indian.
The Indian Cricket team won the 4-0th in England.
The performance of some young sportspersons is very commendable.
Excellent Kohli has not only done a good job, but also gave a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes and best wishes to all of them.
Hockey also got good news after 15 years.
I congratulate these young sportspersons for their success.
This success is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Party.
Our women sportspersons have also achieved excellent success last month.
The Indian Women's Hockey team won the Asian Games Games and a few days ago, India's women's hockey team won the Games in 18 Asia Cups.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the cricketers and hockey players.
My dear countrymen, May the year 2017 be a new hope and zeal.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month, we all celebrated Deepawali.
I went to the Chinese border to celebrate Diwali with the army during Diwali every year.
I have celebrated the festival of Deepawali in the high Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP.
Every year I go to the border, but this time the experience of Deepawali is completely different.
They were filled with this feeling and I see a wonderful reaction to the best wishes that the people of the country have sent and joined the soldiers with their happiness.
When I saw these things, what a wonderful imagination he was wondering.
But, in fact, we don't think that during the festival of Deepawali.
On the contrary, it seems that 125 crore Indians have joined the festival of Deepawali.
Dear countrymen, the joy, happiness, affection and joy that has been transmitted among the soldiers of our army should not be confined to Holi and Diwali alone
I would like you to come and make it a part of nature as a society, as a nation, as a part of nature, whether it is a festival or a festival, whenever we enjoy, we will remember the soldiers of our army in some way or the other.
When it is united with the NAF, the strength of the army will increase by 125 crore.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had met me.
Orajmu-Kashmir was here to attend the Panchayat Summit.
Approximately 40-50 chiefs came from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
It's been a long time to have a conversation.
The recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children came up in a simple discussion with them to make some promises for development and development of the village.
A few days ago, the Board was examined in Kashmir and about 95 of the students were in the examination.
I am clear that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to a bright future development through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment, but also their parents, parents, teachers and all of them for their commitment.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked the people to discuss the Mann Ki Baat this time, I admit that everybody has made the same proposal.
Everyone wanted me to talk about a note of five hundred thousand rupees in detail.
On 8th November night, I had spoken of a great campaign for the nation for the right development of the country.
When I took this decision and told you that decision, I made it clear that this is not a common decision, it is a difficult step.
At the time of announcing the decision, I cautioned that the effect of implementing this proposal would be so impressive that it would take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we would be able to move towards normal conditions.
It is not easy to recover from the disease that has spread over seventy years.
125 crore Indians have full faith and faith in their own country that they are committed to integration for the betterment of the country.
This is the reason why we will succeed and the banks and post office workers are working in adverse effects.
And when there is talk of humanity, they are becoming more active.
He said that when the local bank employees went to their ears, they immediately reached Praveen Bhadralok's house.
Not only this, he has arranged for his treatment.
I was impressed with this incident.
They're taking different ways to save their black money.
One request should not play with the poor people for fulfilling their unjust interests.
Your injustice is being linked to the record of the poor, not after the investigation, these poor people will be trapped, they will suffer.
In order to bring under Benami Property, strict rules have been made which are being implemented in all spheres.
I am a common citizen of the districts of Harda, Tahsil and Village Trili of Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred thousand note bands are very commendable.
My urge is that through Mann Ki Baat, there are some examples that the common man has welcomed you for the progress of the nation despite facing many difficulties.
Thank you very much, you said that the day is coming, but no one can think that you can take such a big step.
By shutting down the notes of five hundred and thousand, you have taught the corrupt blacks.
Every citizen of India does not have a bigger day than this.
That's why I thank you again.
When we hear such news through media, common man and government sources, the zeal of working increases a lot.
People have eaten there, and two-four-six days later, when they returned with the snakes, the bill was removed.
This is the power of my country, while service is the key to traditionalism and sacrifice.
The news that I used to meet during the election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world have also learnt the use of tea-bathak words.
But I didn't know that there could be a cha-beeting.
I got the news that there was a similar marriage in Surah on November 16.
In this marriage, the party had organized only tea for the invitations, there was no other feeding and breeding programme as they had a lack of cash due to the closure of the note.
Travellers also supported the matter and initiated an example in the fight against corruption and black money in Surah's Bharat Maru and Kaushal Parma.
Whenever there is a crisis, people find new paths and once I see an incident in Dhekiyajuli village of Assam in TV.
Tea workers in the village and these tea workers get weekly wages.
The neighbouring four women collected and bought together and made payments in a note of Rs 2,000.
You are well aware that even though the poor people get the minimum amount deposited two days ago.
Only 50 per cent of every municipality taxes are covered.
But after the announcement of the 8th, the old note of the people falls on the stairs of the gathering.
You will be surprised to know that in the last year, during the period of three and a half thousand crore rupees, you will be surprised to know that there was a collection of Rs.
We are getting such a multiple experiment, which has a direct consequence.
Brothers and sisters, village and farmers are the backbone of our country's economy.
I would like to congratulate the farmers of the country especially when we are adjusting every citizen to face many challenges due to this change in the economy.
I was calculating the sale of seeds of this year.
I am glad to see that the number of wheat, pulses or sesame seeds has increased this year as compared to last year.
Farmer brothers have taken new paths in all the complications.
Some important decisions have been taken by the Government, where farmers and villages are being given priority.
Six traders of our country also create employment opportunities and contribute to economic development.
I have taken an important decision in the budget last year for them that even small shops of villages like the big malls of the city will be able to do business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
Sufficient initiatives have been taken to provide their loans through the Mudra scheme.
MUDRA Yojana has given lakhs of rupees to all these small businessmen because innumerable people who are associated with this small business, they have started crores of rupees of commercial transactions.
However, due to this decision, all these small businesses are also complicated.
You also download the bank's app on your mobile phone.
Keep POS machines for credit cards and learn how to do business without note.
You have seen that big malls and bullets continue to do business through technology.
Likewise, a small businessman can also undertake carbour transactions through a simple 'User Friendly' technology.
There is no possibility of any loss in this regard.
I urge you to participate in the creation of a Cashless Society.
You can get full banking facility on mobile phones to promote business and continue business without cash notes transactions.
These are technological ways that are safe, safe and faster.
I want you to assist in the success of this mission, not only in the leadership but also in the leadership, I believe that you can lead this change.
I am confident that all your business transactions in the village can be completed through technology.
I also want to tell the labourers brothers and sisters that there has been a lot of absorption on you.
It's written in the paper, a wage and another hand.
Sometimes, when we got a full-fledged labourer, we saw that there was one standing outside, he had to be divided and labour was forced to consider this absorption as a part of life.
In the new system, we want your bank accounts, your labourer's money is deposited in the bank so that minimum wage conditions are covered.
You should get the full money, nobody cut it.
Today, I especially want to talk to young friends.
We say that India is a country where 65 of the population is below the age of thirty-five years.
You, my country's youngsters and youngsters, I know my decision is liked by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will contribute a lot to taking this thing forward positively.
But friends, you're my real army, real friends.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
The idea that you have about today's world is not of old generations.
It may be that your elder brothers in your family don't even know so much that parents, Kaka-Kakima, maternal uncles don't even know so much.
You know how the booking of app keys, online banking and online tickets is done.
This is very common for you and you also use it.
But today the country wants to do a great job, our dream is Kashlace Society.
It's right that hundred percent of the cashless society is not possible.
But once we can start the Lass-Cash Society, the goal of the Cacheless Society will not be incomplete.
And I want your active cooperation, time and resolution in this regard and I know that you will never despair me because we all are citizens of the poor people of Hindustan who wish to change their lives.
You know how many opportunities are available for the 'Cashless Society', for digital banking or for mobile banking.
Every bank provides online facilities.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
Every bankers have a wallet.
Wallet's white mean E-Manibag.
There's a lot of cardpaws.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, hundreds of millions of poor families of India have Rupee a Y card, which used to be very low.
Since 8th, it has been used by the poor and it has grown by about three hundred percent.
As pre-paid cards are available on mobile phones, bank accounts are available for cost.
And this work is so simple as your Whats Appearta sends.
Cashtransfer can also be found in common features.
Whether it is smoke or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, peanuts, everyone can use it without any reason.
And I have also stressed on simplifying this system.
All the banks are working together.
My young friends, despite all this, there is a whole generation who is unaware of these things.
And you, I know well, this great work is active.
Whatever kind of active message you have given the Whats App - slogan, poetry, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, smiles, and the creative power of the younger generation in the face of the challenge, it seems as if this is the specialty of India that Gita was born during the battlefield at any time.
Similarly, when we are transforming in such a big way, we are showing the basic creativity within you.
But my dear young friends, I am telling you once again that I need your help in this work and I am confident that crores of youngsters of the country will do this work.
Do one thing, you can pledge from today that you will be a part of the Cashless Society itself.
Use the technologies of online costs on your mobile phone.
Not only this, every half an hour, one hour and two hours every day, at least ten families should explain how to use this technology, how to download the apps of their bank, how to spend the money in their accounts, how to give it to the bankers.
Teach the shopkeepers how to do business.
You will have to take the leadership of the great campaign to evacuate the society from the wheels of this cashless society, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to liberate the people from evils and problems.
I invite you to come, not just support, we are soldiers of this change and change.
We will take this fight to liberate the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where the young generation has changed the lifestyle of that country and it will be believed that the changes that are brought by the youth and the youth, they revolutionize.
A mobile system called M-PESA has been set up, technology has been used, M-PESA has been named and today the entire business of Kenya in this region of Africa has transformed into this frontier.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again, once again with a strong interest, I tell you that you will take this mission forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NCC, NSS to do this work individually.
You have seen that the most popular actor of this time Amitabh ji is taking the cleanliness drive forward with a lot of hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through the Manki Baat, your thoughts and ideals are reaching Mai Gauv, Narendra Modi App and keeping me connected with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat is being published at 11 o'clock, but after the end of this broadcast, the system of listening to it is going to start in the regional language.
I am grateful to Akashwani, this new initiative that they have taken so that the people of the country will get the opportunity to join the Hindi language everywhere.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all on Deepawali.
Deepawali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and zeal.
India is a country where for 365 days, some or the other festivals are seen in some part of the country.
By finishing a lot of traditional festivals, we have easily acknowledged a variety of changes in festivals according to the time and the wishes of society.
However, we are able to see this thing well that in India, the journey of this festival, its depth, its impact on every individual for the past year, all these things are associated with the same basic mantra - to move the individual towards the community.
There is an endeavour to spread the mindset of the individual and individual, from the perspective to the perspective of their limited thinking.
And it can be done through this festival.
In India, sometimes the festival is a festival of food and drinks, but it also has an idea of a seasonal festival and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how they can be linked to the festivals, what kind of reforms should be taken to prevent diseases etc.
Today, the whole world is thinking about the environment.
The destruction of nature is a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festival strengthens the love of nature, from boys to everybody with greater auspicious thoughts.
And science has proved that what kind of changes have come in the waters of the sea in Purnima and Amavasya, there is an impact on nature and there is an impact on the minds of the people.
That is, till now, our holidays have also become a tradition of observators by connecting science with art.
Today, when we are celebrating Deepavali, as I said, every festival of ours is academic and a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali conveys the message of 'Tamsoma Emperor Gamai' from darkness to light.
Deepawali is a festival of liberation from darkness to light in the shadow of individual fault.
One thing we all know very well that every family can see the cleanliness drive from the wealthy to the wealthy to the wealthy and the poor, during the Diwali of Diwali.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
Everywhere the government of the world, the parliament, the ruler and the government of the world became part of the festival of Saravadi.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the picture of the festival of Deepawali with pride all over the world.
The 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament, after the Indian sari, stood outside the Parliament and spread their pictures on the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated in Singapore on every road and in every region.
I mean that Deepavali light festival inspires everyone from darkness to light.
During Deepawali, news of accidents, news of fire, news of epidemic awakening.
During Deepavali, many of the doctors go to Deepavali to celebrate Deepavali with all the families.
It's not just a day, it's a long time from Govardhan Puja, Vaifonta, Lava Panchami to Kartik-Purnima.
It is a festival that continues for four days.
But this festival gives a deep message to the society.
It is a promise that all the people of the world worship the rising sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the sun is also worshipped.
It has a very big social message.
I speak of the festival of Deepawali, I speak of Chhat Puja, this is the time when I express my gratitude to all of you, especially to the people of the country.
In the last few months, every soldier of our army has sacrificed everything for our comfort.
My psychological impressions are the sacrifices, meditations and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces.
And that's why I realized that this Deepavali was dedicated to the security forces.
I urge the countrymen to participate in a campaign called Sandesh to Solzers.
But today, I would like to say that there is no such person in India who do not have unbreakable love for the country's army, not proud of the army and the defence forces.
The way people have published it will give strength to the countrymen.
We cannot imagine the security forces, how much your message gives them.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Air Force or the Coast Guard, I can't call everyone, I can't tell you what kind of hardship our soldiers have to suffer.
When we are rearing Deepawali, some of them are in the desert, some of the Himalayas, some of them are protecting the industry, some are protecting the airports and how many responsibilities they are performing.
I really want to express my gratitude to the countrymen.
The artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the poems, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the artists, the
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
The message of Sandesh to Solzers has come in this Hashtag.
Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has read a poem, I want to read it.
I observe the festival, compassionately, tell you today, it's possible that you're here.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and father-in-law had sent me a telephone telephone message.
Come on, let's hear what this soldier family is saying: Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am calling Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Solzers campaign that has started in this Deepawali has encouraged our army brothers.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the Army Officers.
This Sandesh has inspired the army officers and all the army circles on the border.
I would like to say that with the army officers and soldiers, their wife and the entire family have to make a lot of sacrifice.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the army personnel are not only on the borders but also on various aspects of life.
Whether it is natural calamities or administrative calamities or the fight against the enemies or bringing back the youth in a wrong way - our brave soldiers are inspired by patriotism in all the fields of life, I see an event that I want to tell you.
This discussion shows that some families are not able to make toilets in the house due to lack of money.
Vikas Tagore has enhanced the Swachhta Abhiyan with a pocket of one thousand rupees to 57 families.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters have reached the jungle on foot all day with bricks, cements and toilets.
More than one and a half hundred municipalities and corporations have been declared Open Defecation Free in Gujarat.
Ten districts have also been listed.
My dear countrymen, the government has planned a lot of schemes and if there is a better integral plan after the first plan then it has to be removed.
But no one usually takes care of this.
There is no need for kerosene in the households that have gas and electricity in our country.
But who's looking for art in the government
I heard that afterwards seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free.
I think the entire state will become very siggery kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide to all of us.
All his views on what the country will do, how to do, are still considered as examples.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a plan, you will remember the poor and the weaker sections of the country and then you will think that what you are going to do will benefit these people or not, they will be harmed or not
To get rid of the problem, we have to take one step after another.
We have to remove the differences between boys and girls in society, whatever we have an old belief.
This is an example of freedom of discrimination for our daughters in the Indian society.
Though vaccination is done by the government, lakhs of children still get away from the vaccination programme and become victims of the disease.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is a campaign that includes absorption children, which provides strength to the child to get rid of terrible diseases.
The village will remain dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
That is why the campaign for freeing the villages from darkness and providing electricity to the villages is going on with success.
Work is going on before the deadline.
The efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and this campaign is also progressing at a rapid pace.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, dairy sellers, slaughterers get stuck on the neighbouring loans of the great man and get stuck badly.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account are a successful campaign to get rid of all the beneficiaries.
The funds are being directly accessed to the bank through Aadhaar cards and the actual beneficiaries are being directly provided with financial benefits.
It is time for the common man to get rid of the deaths of the Dalits.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great men of this country, who had made the foundation stone of India and showed it the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On the one hand, on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the leading great men of the country's unity, and the death anniversary of Smt.
Mahasay, you know Sardar Patel's birthday on October 31.
Sardar Patel is a person who has spent his entire life for the integrity of the country and I think he has succeeded in this direction.
He has united everyone, and we can say the fate of the country that was killed by Gandhiji on that day.
And what we all know what happened to the country after his death.
Mahasay, I want to tell you how we can stop such an unfortunate incident.
Dear countrymen, this sorrow is not of one.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the history is witness to this incident and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great job to unite the country after the juncture.
But this is also a sad thing that Sardar Saheb had laid down his lives for unity, fought for unity, was the main objective of unity of the country.
But on the birth anniversary of that Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were put on death path after the killing of Smt.
The great personalities who have spent their lives for unity, on their birth anniversary, on Sardar's generation, torture and this background of history hurt us all.
But in this crisis, the mantra of unity has to be taken forward.
Oneness in diversity is the power of the country.
There are many languages, nations, nutritional, food habits, but unity in these diversity is Indias strength, Indias speciality.
Every generation has one responsibility, every government has the responsibility, every government is responsible for unity in every corner of the country and we develop the policy of unity in the country.
We should protect ourselves and the country from the spirit of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us Ek Bharat, our responsibility is to create Shreshtha Bharat.
The basic mantra of unity enhances the desire to build a Shreshtha Bharat.
At present, sometimes we have heard the name of 'Aul'.
Today, people from all over India and India are also familiar with every product of Aul.
But less people know that Doordarshi Sardar Saheb had imagined the formation of a unit of co-operative products.
The Kheda district, which was known as the district at that time, stressed on this idea in 1942 and the real form of it is a living example of what Sardar Saheb did for the happiness and prosperity of the farmers of today.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On this 31st October, on the day of Ekta, wherever we live, we will remember Sardar Saheb and take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Kartik Purnima is also a part of the light festival.
Guru Nanak's teachings and teachings for the entire humanity, not only for India but also for the entire humanity.
It is Guru Nanak's message of service, truth and everyone's goodness.
Peace, unity and harmony was his root mantra.
The campaign to free the society from discrimination, blind faith and mischief was in every word of Guru Nanak.
I salute Guru Nanak from the bottom of the heart on the auspicious Prakash Parv.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Deepavali dedicated to the soldiers of the country, on this occasion of Deepavali.
Your dreams, your resolutions will be successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for your life in peace and happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
A few days ago, we lost eighteen brave children of the country in a brutal attack on Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that's why I will tell my countrymen what I said on that day, I will repeat that the guilty will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
I would like to speak specially to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the powers of the country.
And whoever understands the truth, he has started walking on the path of peace by separating himself from that power.
Every mother-in-law wants to run faster and full-fledged school colleges.
Farmers also want their fruits and crops to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, business has started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are our path of solutions, our progress is also our path of development.
We have to cross new heights of development for future generations.
I am confident that we will sit together to find solutions to all the problems, find solutions and simultaneously make better ways for the future generations of Kashmir.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to take some provisions.
I would like to tell the law guards that we have the powers, powers, laws, rules and regulations, to maintain law and order, to give the life of peace and happiness to the common man of Kashmir.
Sometimes, people of different thoughts nurture other thoughts than what we think.
I have the opportunity to know a lot today in social media.
Every corner of Hindustan gets an opportunity to know the feelings of people from all over the world and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, a student of eleven, sent me a different kind of idea.
He wrote: "I have become very disturbed after a brutal attack on Uri.
I had a question of what I could do for the countrymen.
I resolved to read three hours every day.
I will be able to become a eligible citizen of the country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of Across and at such a young age, I am delighted to think well.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to bring this feeling to the world.
And he had inspired the common man through the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kishan and showed how to work for the country.
Red Bahadur Shastri ji showed one more story of patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to govern the movement, when there was a need to create an oriented orientation in the movement, he used this intensity to further integrate the creative work within the society.
All of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, and all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, and all of us, all of us, all of us, all of us, and all of us, all of us, all of us, and all of us, all of us, and all of us, all of us, who are in the state of governance, all of us, and we have our duties and our duties and we have contributed to this spirit of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, Mr.
S.
Kartik wrote to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who had gone to Para-Olympics have created history and their victory is the victory of Hoomanspirit.
You two have not only created an emotional attachment for every individual of the country to the athletes who participated in Para-Olympics.
Perhaps Para Olympics and our sportspersons have changed our vision towards the disabilities from the perspective of humanity and from the perspective of humanity.
And I'll never forget our winner Deepa owner.
When he got the medal, he said, "I lost disability through this medal.
It has a lot of strength.
This time, nineteen athletes, including three women from our country, participated in Para-Olympics.
If you compete with other sports with disabled persons then the sports capabilities and sports capabilities become a big thing by impressing these things - will power, will power and will power.
You will be happy to know that our sportspersons have won four medals, two gold medals, one silver medal and one gold medal.
Devendra Jhajharia won the gold medal for the second time after twelve years.
The age grows in twelve years, and once it gets gold medals, it's hungry.
But Devendra showed that the condition of the body, the growing age, never let him sleep and he won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't disabled from birth.
Because of electric shocks, he left his hand.
You can imagine that the person who gets the first gold medal at the age of thirty-five years and the second gold medal at the age of thirty-five years has done a great job in his life.
Mariyappan won the gold medal at Thangavelu High Jump.
Thungavelu lose his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty can't stop his determination.
He didn't come from a big city, he didn't come from a middle class cleaner family.
In the twenty-four years of life, fighting with all the thorns, despite physical problems, he has brought medals to the country in the strength of determination.
Athlete Deepa has been associated with the owner's name.
Varun C.
Bhati won the medal in the high jump.
The medals of Para-Olympics have been very important in our country, in our society and around us, in our visionary transformation towards our disabled brothers and sisters.
Very few people knew how the people with disabilities showed the para-olympics this time.
A few days ago, there was an Olympic competition at the same place.
Not only this, I was amazed when I came to know that the fourth among the bandits who did not get any medal, they ran in less time than the gold medal which was won by the common sportspersons and I once again congratulate all of us.
In the coming days, India is on the path of creating a smooth scheme for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, how wonderful I have experienced in Navsari in Gujarat last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India organised a Mega Campaign for Divyangjans and many World Record Campaigns on that day.
There I meet a young girl Gaurishardul, who is not able to see the girl from the far-flung jungle of Dang district.
The Government of India has established a world record on the land of Navsari, which is very important.
In eight hours, 600 Divyangs who cannot listen to have access to machines.
The event was held at the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to set up three-three World Records by Divyangjans in a day.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our habit, every citizen should have a duty and a environment of hatred towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when two years are being completed, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 125 crore people.
I had said that we should move forward in the direction of cleanliness and today we all can say that everybody has tried to move forward in one step.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore steps towards cleanliness.
Therefore, everybody may be the common man, the ruler, the government office or the roadside, the bushepo or railway station, the school-colleges, the shrines, the poor from the hospital, the abomination of the village, the farmer Ramani, everyone has contributed to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to go a long way.
If we are healthy, we have to stop the habit of defecation in the open space for respecting the citizens, especially for the respect of mothers and sisters.
And that is why an Open Defecation Free (ODF) i. e.
I had just visited Gujarat and officials told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the goal of ODF on 2nd October this year.
Congratulations to those who have already succeeded in this objective and convey their best wishes to all those who have succeeded in this objective.
My dedication to the people of the country - for the respect of mothers and sisters, for the health of small and small children, our country will be freed from this problem.
Come on, let us pledge to move forward.
I would like to start a new scheme for the young friends who are habituated to technologies today.
Everybody has the right to know how the cleanliness mission is in your city and that is why the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this number of 1969, you will not only be able to know about the construction of toilets in your city but also ask for new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, take advantage of this.
The Government of India is also urging the Corporate World to come forward and urges professionals to sponsor those who wish to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Workers.
And therefore, along with the Swachhta Mission, we have to move forward towards the Wasteto Compost.
Chemical fertilizers have been told to buy the compost that was made from Waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should get the necessary liquid.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, those who have suffered from the use of chemical fertilizers, they also need such fertilizers in some quantity.
Shri Amitabh Bachhan has been a brand Ambassador for this work.
I see that there is a continuous new news about cleanliness.
One day I read the news papers - students of Gujarat Technology University have gone to 107 villages and started awareness campaigns for toilet construction.
The Government of India has also created a one-year calendar in its various departments.
Every department is focusing on 15 days, especially on cleanliness.
I urge the common citizens to join this campaign if these government departments are working with them and you are associated with them in any way.
This time there are about five hundred cities in the population after one lakh.
Therefore, there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we will do a good thing next time.
Cleanliness has created an atmosphere of competition.
I hope all citizens will participate in this campaign.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
Two years of Swachh Bharat Mission are being completed.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I urge you to buy something prepared from khadi.
I would like to urge every family to buy khadi goods, to light the lamps of the poor households.
On 2nd October, however, as a citizen, can we take part in the cleanliness campaign somewhere or the other
You should work hard for at least two to four hours for cleanliness and share one of its photographs on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have video, you can share it.
With this collective effort, this campaign will get strength, will get a new momentum.
Let us remember Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and resolve to do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, there is a different joy to donate some recognition in life.
In the past, I have also seen that when I had requested to give up the subsidy on gas, the way the common man has given up, it is an inspirational event in our national life.
Some of our youngsters, small organisations, people from the corporate world, students from school and some voluntary organisations will jointly celebrate Joy of Giving Week in many cities from October 2 to October 8.
The mission aims to provide food items, clothing, etc. to the underprivileged.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, I saw that the old toys that our servants went to different families and collected in their homes and used to collect the old toys that they had in the poor habitations.
It's really good to see the poor boys enjoying these games.
I believe that the joy of living week will be celebrated in all the cities and the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of charity.
I extend my best wishes to all the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, on 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and his birth centenary is being celebrated from today.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
In these two words, he demonstrated his economic feelings.
The country will celebrate his birth centenary as a 'Grib Welfare Year'.
Societies, governments and all others have to be concentrated on how the beneficiaries of development will benefit from poverty.
My dear countrymen, on the occasion of Vijayadashmi two years ago, I started the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The common man of the country has always been associated with me, which has always been published in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the kind of encouraging and blessings you have given to this event on the completion of the two years of Mann Ki Baat.
I express my gratitude to Akashwani that they have not only propagated the event but also made every effort to reach the audience in all languages.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country who have written letters, suggestions, defects and defects of the government system and have created a special event on all these letters and have created a platform to solve the problems faced by the government employees.
This is the reason why Mann Ki Baat is not just a speech of 15-20 minutes but also a new medium of social change.
What else could happen to someone who is more satisfactory than this
For this reason, I thank all those associated with it for making this decision successful.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi and Deepavali will start in the next week.
Navratri or Durga Puja - This worship of energy must be the worship of the unity of the society.
There will be festivals to connect with each other.
But that will be the meditation of real energy and only then we can celebrate the victory festival together.
Let us worship the energy, let us move forward with the mantra of unity.
Yesterday, 29th August, Hockey's birth anniversary of magician meditation.
This day is celebrated in the National Sports Day celebrations across the country.
I would like to pay homage to Dhyan Chand ji and also remind you of his contribution.
He played an important role in winning Gold in Olympic Hockey in India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We're all cricket lovers, we know the name of Bradman.
He talked about meditation moon, he scores goals like runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a sportsperson and a living torch of patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, the player of the opposition was hit by a hockey stick on the head of Dhanchandji.
The time the match is over and only 10 minutes is left.
Dhyan Chand ji turned three rounds in that 10 minutes and said, I took the revenge of injury.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes during the Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of suggestions in MyGov portal or Narendra Modi app.
Shri Ajit Singh has written in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell the MMEs about their participation in education and sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Rio Olympics.
Mr. Shachin has written to you, now you will surely mention the work of Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa in Mann Ki Baat.
One of them is from North India and one from South India, one from eastern India and one from other parts of India.
It seems as if the glitter of India's name has been enhanced by the girls across the country.
In the My-Gov portal, learned Tagore wrote, we could make better results in Olympics.
He wrote, Honble Modi, sir, first of all, thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But in this context, I would like to attract your attention - what was the quality of our participation in other competitions
The answer is 'No'.
And nobody else can do better than you.
Similarly, Mr. Satyaprakash Mehra wrote in the Narendra Modi App, "Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on additional educational programmes, especially for children and youth.
Thousands of people have expressed similar feelings.
There is no way to deny that we couldn't show the results as expected.
In some cases, it has also been decided that our sportspersons had reached the country and could not reach the same level in the field of sports.
And in the medal list, we are only two medals.
But even if we don't really get the risk, we will see that Indias sportspersons have shown a lot of transparency for the first time.
Look, our innovation has won the fourth place in the shooting and he has won the medal for a very short time.
Deepa work in Gymnastics has also performed a very good sports performance and has empowered the fourth place, very little sports medals.
But how will we forget how he is the first Indian woman in Gymnastics who has qualified for the Olympics and the final festival of Olympics.
Around this kind of incident happened in the areas of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna jute.
This time we showed good results in athletics.
After 32 years of age, Lalita Babar won the talent of sports at Track and Field Field Field.
Boxing-Ovikash Krishna Jadav reached the uarter uarter, but didn't win medals.
A lot of sportspersons, such as Aditya Ashoka, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das, who have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done now, we may be desperate again.
I announced the formation of a committee.
We will deliberately deliberately discuss how sports are going on in the world.
We'll make a roadmap for how we can do better.
We have planned the results by 2020, 2024, 2028.
I would also urge the state governments to form such a committee and see what we can do in the sports world.
I would also urge institutions associated with sports to do brainstorming indirectly.
The State Governments should review themselves and send their suggestions.
We have to prepare the entire artisans and I believe that we have to make a pledge to make 125 crore Indians, 65 percent of the youngsters, the best results in the sports world.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, the Teachers Day.
I have spent some time with the students on Teachers' Day for a few years and spent time as a student.
I learned a lot from these little boys.
I have the same teaching day as September 5.
But now I have to go to the G-20 Summit, so I want to express my feelings in Mann Kiwat today.
The more the place of mothers and mothers in life, the more the place of teachers.
This time, after the Reo Olympics, the story of Pullela Gopichand is being discussed again and again.
He's a sportsperson, but we have the evidence of how good he's trained.
Today, I see Gopichand as a best trainer than a sportsperson.
And on Teachers' Day, I honour Pullela Gopi Chand for his compassion, for his sports, for his sports and for the success of his disciples.
We always feel the role of teachers in our lives.
On 5th September, the President of India, Dr.
Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji's birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day.
He always tried to spend his day as a teacher wherever he reached his life.
Not only this, he always used to say, "The good teacher is the one in which the students are never lost.
Even after being the President, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji has shown this wonderful life to keep his day as a teacher, to keep his own students alive.
I have sometimes thought that I remember a lot of teachers because he was our ideals in our small villages.
I can say with joy that one of my teachers who are now 9 years old, even today I have a letter written by him every month.
If there is a photograph with your teachers, if there is a good incident with your teachers, if there is a message sent to your teachers then you must share it with everyone on the Narendra Modi App.
See, it is very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country from the vision of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be celebrated a few days later.
Lord Ganesh has removed all the difficulties and we all want our country, our society, our family, our people and their lives to be irregular.
Whenever we talk of Ganesh festival, it is natural to remember the name of Lokmanya Tilak.
Lokmanya Tilak gave the Ganesh Festival an universal form.
Through the Sarvajani Ganesh Festival, he made this religious festival a festival of public consciousness, a festival of social reform.
All the issues that affect social life should be discussed through the Sarvajan Ganesh Festival, so that the society becomes a new force, a new force, a new force, a new spirit, a new spirit, a new spirit, a new spirit, and a new spirit of discipline that is being organised at this time.
In the same way, the mantra of Lokmanya Tilak, Swaraj, the right to our birth, is the centre of discussion.
Today, not only Maharashtra but also the Ganesh festival is celebrated everywhere in the country.
In particular, the youngsters are enthusiastically preparing for this festival.
Some people are still trying to follow the thoughts of Lokmanya Tilak that he started this festival.
Discussions, composition competitions, composition competitions were organized on various topics.
The monument of the Statue impresses our society in a beautiful manner.
In this public Ganesh Festival, a campaign for public education is being organized.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra of 'Swaraj Our Birthday Right'.
But now we live in an independent India.
On this universal Ganesh festival, we will now say, Su-raj is our right.
We will move on the path of Suraj, Suraj will be our basic requirement.
Can't we go ahead with this mantra
Come on, I urge you.
Our life is impossible without the festival, but we have to change it according to the timelines.
This time many people have written a lot about Ganesh Festival and Durga Puja.
They are particularly worried about the environment.
A person named Shankar Narayan Narayan Narain told me, "Modiji, you people should explain that they should use the Ganesh statue made of Pushkarini's soil without using the plaster of Parisdise.
The protection of the environment, the protection of the rivers and the flowers, and the protection of the small living creatures from polluted water is the transformation of the service of God.
Lord Ganesh-Bighanhari
So we don't create such statues that makes a hurry.
I don't know how you're going to take my words, but I'm not talking alone, many more.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
Durga Puja still has some time left.
Now we have to decide that those old families who made idols, if they make idols from Pushkarini or river then they will get the opportunity to earn.
And after the festival, they will resource and save the environment.
I convey my best wishes to all of you for Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Madar Teresa will be awarded in 'Sant' on 4th September, 2018.
Mother Teresa had served the poor people of India for his entire lifetime.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of this mother Teresa, who has made a lot of efforts to make herself fit for the service of the poor.
To participate in the event that will be organised on 4th September, a delegation of officers headed by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj on behalf of the Government of India will be present there.
We can always learn something from saints, sages, monks and great men.
I hope we'll get something new, learn and do something good.
Jan Shakti is considered as a form of God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common man to the Ganga Safai campaign for clean Ganga in collaboration with five State Governments.
The villagers present in Allahabad have taken a pledge to shut down the habit of open defecation in the villages of their homes, to shut down the toilets, to make toilets, to not allow Ganga to be all over, to participate in the Ganga sanitation campaign.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have made this event possible.
I would like to thank the Chief Ministers of Punjab who have taken an important step by connecting the common man with the Ganga Safai mission.
This work has been done by girls from seven to seventeen years of age.
This letter has an emotional effect that when the children and children came to school on the next day after getting the letter, they have written letters to some parents of the school teachers, they will be able to make toilets at home within a specific date.
A sixteen-year-old girl from Koppal district of Karnataka has sat on Satyagraha against her family.
When the Prime Minister of the village, Mohammad Shafi, could know that Mallama was making Satyagraha for toilets, he made a toilet within a week with a cost of Rs 18,000.
The village chief like Jed Shakti and Mohammad Shafi, a girl like Mallamma, is really remarkable.
The way roads can be built to solve the problem, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is now a dream of all Indians.
It's a resolution to someone.
And some Indians have chosen it as their goal.
The Government of India has been conscious and all the people are being told to make a film on Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this short film to the Government of India.
Detailed details of this will be available on the website.
It will be a competition and will be awarded to the winners on 2nd October, Gandhi Jayanti.
I'm also telling TV channels, you're competing with such films.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, be it ease and livelihood.
A few days ago, an important event took place, our President, Honble Pranab Mukherjee had greeted the Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Now many people may think that the President will inaugurate a radio channel
But it's not a common radio channel, it's a very important step.
Our reader is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still moving forward with the same cultural tradition.
On the one hand, Akashwani Maitri and on the other hand, Akashwani Maitri will share various events among themselves, and the Bengali Bengali people from both sides will enjoy the Akashwani Vayana.
All India Radio has contributed to people-to-people contact.
It was inaugurated by the Honble President.
I would like to thank Bangladesh as well as those who are associated with it.
I convey my best wishes to the friends of ASHAN and they are also playing their role in foreign policy.
This kind of events give new energy, new inspiration, and this is the source of inspiration for the people of the country.
A few days ago, I got a letter that dragged my mind.
Almost twenty-four years old mother, a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
If not, he would have forbidden his name in the letter, I was very interested in telling you all.
In the letter, he wrote, "When you applied for subsidy on gas, I left the gas subsidy and then I forgot it.
The countrymen, you all know, I tried to send a letter to those who left the gas subsidy, and my representatives were present and asked for that letter.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
The blessings of the mother and her millions of mothers and sisters are helpful in building the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, we were very worried about the fact that last year, but in the month of August, we have been constantly in trouble of floods.
There have been several floods in some parts of the country.
State Governments, Central Governments, Local Administrative Institutions, Social Institutions and Citizens have made it possible.
But there are reports that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by taking these young boys forward, they must certainly have to respond to these innocent boys.
My dear countrymen, our country is strong and rich in diversity.
Thank you very much till now.
I had the opportunity to spend some time with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that in the coming days, every youngster will be able to spread across the country.
We all know that in a few days, the world's largest sports sports sports event is going to be held.
Our ears will be reversed again.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organized a vast and beautiful race titled Run for Rio, Khelo and Bachao, Sports and Prospects.
I'll do something to encourage our sportspersons wherever I'm in the next day.
I will also be with you to enhance the zeal of our sportspersons as a citizen like 125 crore Indians.
Come, let us all make the sportspersons proud in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Reo Olympics, I read a poem from a poetry-premick-Punjab Central University, Suraj Prakash Upadhaya.
There may be many more poets who have written a lot of poems, maybe somebody writes poems and repeat it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poem that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, has reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam Ji.
Last week, the nation and the world paid homage to Abdul Kalam Ji on his death anniversary.
Whenever the name of Alaknanda ji was named, then the picture of science, technology, missiles - a powerful India of the future is put in front of our eyes.
And that's why it is written that what is your government doing to realise the dream of Kalaam ji
If we traced the old technologies by excluding research and innovation, then we will remain out of the changing era of the world.
And that is why the new generation is attracted to science, technology development, research and innovation.
So, I say, Let us aim to innovate.
And when I call Let us aim to innovate, AIM means Atal II
If we have to make the next generation entrepreneurs, then we have to connect with these things.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative to create Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we want a strong and quality laboratory, we have a infrastructure for innovation, for innovation, for working, for a certain goal.
As new laboratories are required, there is also a need to improve the quality of old research laboratories.
We need to find technical solutions to these problems everyday.
We have called upon todays youngsters to the Atal Grand Challenges, if there is a problem in your eyes, find technology for solutions, research and research, we have told us.
If the Government of India can introduce such new technologies to solve our problems, it would encourage innovators to be specially awarded.
I'm glad that people have a lot of interest in this.
When we talk about 'Tingering Lab', more than thirteen thousand schools applied and when we talked about 'Incubation Centre', more than four thousand educational and other institutions applied.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to support the flood affected people.
Though there is some problem for the rains, everybody's mind becomes stronger in the rains because we have the centre of the entire economic picture of rain and farming.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we have to absorb the lifelong.
However, if we are aware, be careful, be able to deal with diseases, then it's easy to save the throat.
Try to be careful about cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Focus on children and there is no misconception that dengue happens only in a poor settlement but it is not right.
Happy, the first dengue spreads in rich Alaka.
You must be aware of Doordarshan but sometimes we are desperate to use it.
Friends, I would like to attract your vision to each other.
Life is so intense, so there is no chance to worry for itself.
I'm sick, I think we'll get well soon, so we'll go to an antibiotic game.
But my dear countrymen, the habit of eating antibiotics can create a serious problem.
Maybe you're relieved for some time, but we should stop eating antibiotics in consultation with doctors.
The bacteria that are in TB and malaria are rapidly transforming themselves so that the drugs are capable of getting destroyed.
It is called Antibiotic Registration in doctoral language.
Anti-biotics should be used in regulations.
You must take care of it.
When there is a health matter, I want to join another thing.
Sometimes the concerns of the loss of lives of the pregnant mothers in our country are very high.
In our country, about three crore women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that the maternal mortality rate has decreased in the last decade, but even today many pregnant mothers are not possible to save their lives.
During pregnancy, deficiency of blood, infections during delivery, high blood pressure and irrelevant risks will never destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
According to the campaign, all pregnant women will be tested at the Government Health Centre on 9th of every month.
It will be possible to save the lives of both mothers and children, and I would like to specifically tell the parentalists that you cannot get free treatment for the poor mothers on the 9th of a month.
Is my doctor brothers and sisters not able to deserve themselves for ease of doing the poor for twelve days a year
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is particularly worried about climate change, global warmth and environment.
During the war in Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also spoke of trees in the field of war, and we can guess the importance of trees in the field of war.
In the Geetha, Lord Shri Krishna says, Ashwatth: Sarvavrikshanang means I am Ashwatth among all the trees.
It has been stated in the Shukracharya Rules that there is no such tree that has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses that tree like plants.
Therefore, the parents who talk about their welfare, plant a good tree and grow like a child.
Our scriptures - Geetha or Shukracharya policy or the discipline of Mahabharata - are some of the present generations who have shown this philosophy of Shastra in their work.
A few days ago, I remember a golden example of a daughter of Pune who touched my heart.
On the occasion of the discipline of the Mahabharata, the trees also serve the duties of the children, and gold has not only been responsible for their parents but also for fulfilling the demands of the society.
Kisankandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer from Narayanpur village of Junnar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, has done his grandson Golden Marriage in an exemplary manner.
Other temples can also start the tradition of planting trees instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, India has to import crores of rupees of wooden pulps from abroad to build houses in India.
If we plant such trees on the edge of eating, which will be used to make houses and jewellery, then you can sell them by cutting government permission after 15-20 years.
This can be a new source of income and save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have launched several campaigns with the benefit of this rainy season, the Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act, more than 40,000 crore rupees are being sold to the states for planting trees.
Rajasthan is a desert state and has taken the pledge of planting 25 lakh plants.
25 lakh plantations in Rajasthan are not small.
Those who are associated with the soil of Rajasthan will know how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh also aims to increase the greenery of the state by 50 by 2029.
The Government of India is running the Green India Mission, the Railways are making greenery through that scheme.
Gujarat also has a bright sustainability of the Van Mahotsav.
This year, Gujarat has celebrated several schemes namely Ambaon, Ektavan, Shahid Van as Van Mahotsav and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I can't mention all the states, but all are worthy of appreciation.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
This is my visit to the country and whenever there is a foreign journey, there is a talk of diplomacy, business and security, sometimes the MoU was signed.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is remembered, it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever there are words of non-violence, love, forgiveness etc. in this world, their faces emerge in front of our eyes.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoenix Settlement, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to travel from the Peter Maritzburg station to the train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled. But I would like to say that this time I had the opportunity to meet those great people who lived their lives for equal rights and equality for all.
Even after so many penances, they didn't seem to have anything to take on their faces, to have anything to do with them.
The duties that were spoken in the Geetha are as if I was able to see among them.
I'll remember that meeting forever.
There can be no mantra of equality and equal opportunities for any society or any government.
This is the path that takes us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, a good future for children - everybody's needs are different.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same, and that path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and feelings to all.
Come, let us feel proud for those Indians who have lived in South Africa as well as the mainstream of our life.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Verma, he has told me about an event.
Prime Minister, I am speaking from Bangalore to artist Varma.
Just a few days ago, I have read in a newspaper that a gentleman has committed suicide by losing 11.
I have a great condolence to his family as a woman.
I want to know what you are thinking about this fraudulent and Bhuo e-mail.
"Some people get stuck in the money.
This is a new way of technologies that is spreading all over the world.
As technology has played a major role in economic development, people who misuse it have also fallen into the field.
You also make mistakes at some time, because they write your letters so beautifully as if it's real.
Your credit card, debit card number, and your bank account is empty through technology.
This is a new kind of cheating, digital cheating.
We have to stay away from this kind of fame, be cautious, and we have to share these messages with the friends of Alenaz and caution them.
Our parliamentarians also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk about them and tell them about their discomfort.
But recently I have a good experience.
Some students from Aligarh had come to me.
He's made a wonderful picture at the station.
Not only this, we have set up a vertical garden with soil-filled trees in the village where plastic bottles or oil cane were covered.
Thus, the railway station has been completely new.
You must visit the station in Aligarh.
There's a new feeling.
This is an example of what changes can be brought about in public participation.
Thanks to those who are doing this kind of work in the country, especially my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country as soon as the rains come.
Festivals will be held at different places in the coming days.
Festivals will be celebrated at the temple, at the place of worship and you will also be celebrating the festival at home and bye.
Rakhibandan is an important festival of ours.
Like last year, cannot you offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to mothers and sisters of the country on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in an independent India.
The uit India Movement was launched on 8th August this year, 75 years and on 15th August it will be 70 years of independence.
We are enjoying freedom, feeling proud of being an independent citizen. It is your time to remember those people who brought this freedom.
The 75 years of the uit India Movement and 70 years of independence can inspire us, give a new zeal and take a pledge to do something good for the country.
I hope you will also do something good in the spirit of self-reliance.
And nowadays, technology has become so affordable that whatever thing you can easily deliver to me, I invite you, let us remember the holy life of the freedom fighters.
Everybody plans on holidays.
And this vacation is our season, you think I'm tasted (I enjoy eating).
Sometimes it seems that if there is a chance to sleep at some time in the afternoon then it would be very good.
But this time the hot heat has snatched all fun all around.
It is very natural for the people of the country to be concerned.
And the water conservation is also decreasing in the frequent settlement.
And that is why everybody in these places has a lot of sensitivity and water conservation efforts to do something.
Just a few days ago, some people were telling me that the Hibde Bazar village Panchayat in Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and its subordinate villagers have given immense importance to the needs of water in the villages.
All the crops that are required for water, ghee, banana etc. have decided to leave the crops of those crops.
The more simple to hear, it's not easy to habit.
Everyone has made a big pledge together
If any factory uses water and we talk of shutting down the factory, because the use of water is increasing, then you know what will be the result.
It's right that I talked about a small village Hebde Bazar, but there are many more villages like this.
I congratulate all these villagers for this kind of good work.
I am told that the Gorba Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh had tried to build agri pond in its efforts.
They had constructed about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This has resulted in an increase in ground water level, water has risen up a lot.
I'm gonna say they're more than the railways.
The nature of human beings is that whenever the day is spent in dangers, there is no harmony, it seems as if there is a danger.
Since 106 per cent, there is a possibility of 110 per cent rainfall in the world.
There is still a delay in rains, but the news of good rains has created a new zeal.
The farmers need soil and the crops in the fields.
Can't we take the soil from the village pond to the field now
Farms will also be better and their water conservation capacity will also increase.
Can sometimes water be stored in the cement cottage, sometimes in the empty storeys of fertilizers, in the streets of stones and soil filled with water
The water level will increase, our well will get water.
So as much water is required to be stored.
The rain water will remain in the village and if we do something for this purpose, it will be possible in a collective effort.
So today the water crisis is fine, it's okay, but next month we have time and a half.
Shriman Kumar Krishna questioned Mai Gauv whether the Ganga sanitation campaign will be possible in our lives
How many governments have come, how many projects have been built and too much has been spent.
And that is why this question arises in the minds of crores of people of the country like Bhai Kumar Krishna.
The Ganga establishes our roti and roti and gives us the strength to live in a new way.
As the Ganga flows, it also provides a new impetus to the economy of the country.
One Bhagirath brought us the Ganges, but to save it, crores of Bhagiraths needed.
This work will never be possible without the mass help of the people.
We have to become a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several projects are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to fully cooperate with all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations together.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factories.
Every day there is a lot of jungle in the Ganges through the drains and rivers.
In order to clean the jungle, Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc. , trash skimmers keep cleaning the jungle soaking in water.
All local organisations have been informed and requested to continue the work and regularize the work of cleaning the jungle.
Earlier, I was told that whenever efforts are made well, it is possible to clean the jungle from 3 to 11 tonnes per day.
So it's right that we're able to clean a large quantity of jungle.
There is a plan to set up trash skimmers at other places in the coming days.
And its utility will soon be understood by the people of Ganga and Yamuna, an effective plan has been prepared for controlling the pollution of pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry.
The waste evacuation from the factory of Pulp and Paper Industrie Black Liquor is almost completely closed.
All these phenomenons prove that we are moving towards the right goal and the awareness has increased.
People are also providing financial assistance for the cleanliness of the Ganga, which is going on very well.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated in India as Panchayati Raj Diwas.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today, the Panchayati Raj system in the country is working successfully as one of the most important democracies of our democracy.
On 14th April we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and today on 24th April we are celebrating Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful endeavour, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He is inspired to work towards connecting the village with the Constitution.
Towards this end, his birth anniversary was launched from 14th April to 24th April, on 10th April, from Villageoday to Bharatodaya.
I am fortunate that on 14th April, Babasaheb Ambedkar had the opportunity to visit his birthplace Mahoo and to salute that sacred place.
Today, on 24th, I will celebrate Panchayati Raj Diwas in Jharkhand, where most tribal brothers and sisters are present.
Once again, I will talk to all the Panchayats of the country at three o'clock.
This campaign has done a funny awareness.
At the same time, such programmes have been going on in such villages of India for ten days.
I congratulate all the state governments and the villagers for this.
You have used this opportunity to further strengthen the democracy for the betterment and prosperity of the village in a very basic and new way.
And that is why all of us will insist on village Udai as much as we will get epidemic results.
Shermila called Dharkur from Mumbai and told her feelings.
- Prime Minister Namaskar
I'm talking to Sharmila Dharkur from Mumbai.
You have questions about my school and education.
Like, there has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has a single dream, then it is a child's education.
It's about the house and the car.
This idea for the education of children in a country like India, the idea of teaching them a lot, a fascinating energy.
I would like to further enhance this spirit of good education to the child, and there is a need to get more awareness about this.
Therefore, I would urge all parents and parents to discuss the school programme with children for a long time.
And if you think something, go to school and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help in reducing our educational defects.
And it will be possible in everyone's participation.
Every government of our country has given importance to education and they have tried in their own way.
And it is true that for a long time, we had a focus on building educational institutions, expanding education systems, building schools and colleges, appointing teachers and many children to come to school.
We have done a big job in promoting education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literature campaign should be our main objective.
These days, there was a need to calculate infrastructure.
Now the success of education needs to be assessed.
So far, how many students have come to the school.
Recruitment, Recruitment, Recruitment.
But now we have to focus on giving good and qualified education to the children who have come to school.
You have seen the present government's budget.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
It's right, there's many ways left.
But if we decide 125 crore people, then we will also be able to cross this path.
But Sharma ji's point of view is true that we want to change our mindset.
You must have noticed that in the budget, some work has been done out of traditional ideas.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten non-governmental universities have been asked to get rid of government bonds and ask them to know what are the challenges they face to be the best university.
Indias universities can compete with other universities in the world and also have to compete with such competitions.
At the same time, education is as important as skills.
Therefore, technology will play a big role in education.
Technologies for remote education will make our education system easier.
And I believe I can understand the results in a far-flung future.
Honble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm telling Meena Karnwal from Bijnor.
Today, youngsters have played an important role in writing and sports.
They should have the mindset of working together and the quality of good leadership so that their holistic development is possible.
I want you to inspire a large number of youngsters and I want the government to encourage the maximum number of NCCs, NSS and India Scouts and Guide.
You have sent me so much suggestions that even before I have spoken to you, I would like to interact with NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides.
I have organized a meeting on your repeated request to the NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Yuva Kendras.
Whenever I asked them when they met before, they told me that after the independence of the country, they were present in such a meeting for the first time.
Now I've got some such things in front of them.
I told them why our young friends will not take part in water conservation during this summer
There's a similar conversation with them.
I see it as a flashing thing in us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there has been a lot of discussions on how many parties will give gas cylinders
Economists spoke of reducing gas subsidy.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidy.
It's all experienced.
I said this kind of thing, but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have voluntarily left gas subsidy.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see some of those who have left the subsidy, retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers - such a middle class or lower middle class family.
However, it has been seen that more than 80 percent of these one crore families who have left the gas subsidy have gone to the distributors and stood in line and left the gas subsidy.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives a slight discount to the tax, then the government will be commended on weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, Subsidy is considered as the right to unite.
But one crore families have left the subsidy.
First of all, I salute hundreds of families and congratulate them because they have forced political leaders to think newly.
The world's economists, who do this, make such a financing offensive, are beyond their concerns.
Sometimes I think we declare that there will be no ticket testers on this route of the railway.
We can do many such tests.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can get hopeful results.
Anyway, it's your opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create such an environment.
And this environment is not creating a political leader, one crore families of the country have created this environment.
All breaking news is bad news.
Is nothing good about us in this country of 125 crore population
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again and again.
A few days ago, on behalf of a news paper, he wrote a letter to me that on Monday they will not publish any desperate news.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
It is true that if a well-known person selects a good word, describes it properly, the effect of it can be seen more than that.
Good news inspires to do good work.
It's right, if you pay attention to good, the bad place will be reduced by yourself.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will be removed, it will be, it will be
Perhaps you know that this is why a website has been opened by the Government - Transforming India.
This is not just the government but also the common man you can send a good news to this portal.
You can also participate in this.
Raviji, you gave a good advice, but please don't get angry with me.
We will all try to work together, we will try to talk constructively, we will try to reach a constructive goal.
The speciality of our country is Kumbh Mela.
Kumbh Mela can be the center of tourist attraction.
The world's very few people know that for such a long time, millions of people have come to the river bank.
This fair is celebrated in a calm atmosphere.
This event creates a big glimpse in the institutional vision of event management and in the vision of common man's partnership.
For the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading the pictures of Singhast Kumbh.
I want the tourism department of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition on these pictures.
And tell the people to upload a good photograph.
He said that we have put special emphasis on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only be stuck in this campus, but they want people to take the message of cleanliness from the Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair but we can make it a social mixture.
I can also create a cultural sector.
This can be an opportunity to reach the village of Satya Prabhas.
My dear countrymen, on this auspicious day of Panchayat Raj, I will definitely meet you once again and thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I have always waited for Mann Ki Baat and for you.
This time also I have seen that a large number of letters, comments and phones have come here, in which many stories have been received, suggestions have been received and inspired.
I think you're testing me.
However, I want to share your words with you once again in the series of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I talked about a book of Premchandji's story and we decided that if someone reads a book, we will share some things with everyone through the NarendraModiApp.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information about various types of books.
I am happy to see that people have discussed a lot of things like science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, trade and self-life.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But I have to admit that I don't get too much time to read books.
But I think we should take this experience forward in the last one month.
I want these books to become an active platform for corners, readers and writers.
Friends, I feel that in Mann Ki Baat, water conservation had touched this thing earlier, but today I feel that before I say this water conservation was a matter of touching your hearts, it was a matter of love for the common man.
I feel that this water has recently driven the hearts of your countrymen.
Several effective efforts are being made in water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about various traditional practices.
A lot of innovations have started on media conservation.
This is not only preventing the destruction of land and crops but also providing water to the fields.
You will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-East, Meghalaya, the first state of the country, which has switched to its own water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs at this time.
We can use these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to this fair.
We can make exhibitions here, drama and drama and enhance water conservation along with festivals.
That's why today some children want to listen to you.
These are Nidhi Byptu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Forest Tesh Ganguly and Hartik Ala-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I will say about them and you will also have a brightness.
We all know that cancer is a word that the whole world is scared.
Looks like death stands in the sword.
But these ten children have not only defeated fatal diseases like cancer in the war of their lives, but have also brightened India's name in the world.
In the field of sports, we have often seen that a sportsperson is either after winning the winner or after winning the medal, but this is a rare experience, where he has been defeated before taking part in the competition and he has again fought his life.
This month, the World Children's Winners Games was organized in Moscow.
Sports like shooting, swimming, race, football, table television etc.
Our country has won the medal in this 10th edition.
Some of them won medals again.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you are also proud of India's achievements in the far-flung space through the sky, Chandrayaan 2.
Sanjeev Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Several people like Arvind Rao have written this on Narendra Modi App and My Gauv from different parts of the country and expressed their interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, from the point of view of space research, 2019 is a very good year for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and then this Chandrayaan-2.
It was not possible to discuss such a big and important news like A-SAT at that time.
Within just 3 minutes, the A-SAT missile was capable of hitting a satellite of 300 km away.
India is the fourth country in the world which has achieved success in this specific sector.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country was proud to see how Chandrayaan-2 from Sriharikota had departed from space.
The successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 has made the country proud, filled with energy and joy.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special kind of mission.
We should believe in our talent and capability.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
It is Indian in mind.
This is a fully indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-II in record time and day-night technological problems.
We also face such temporary setbacks in our lives.
But always keep in mind that we have the capability to cross this obstacle.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the ultimate truth that science is the path of development.
We are now waiting for the month of September when two landers will descend to the moon's land, Vikram and Rover.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat, I would like to invite the students of my country, my young friends for a fascinating competition, mean competition and invite the youngsters of the country in a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, India's space mission, science and technology, the main topics of this question: what to do to launch a rocket, how to send a satellite to the room or what to know from this satellite, A-Satki.
I would urge my young friends to participate in this uiz Competition and make it even more familiar and memorable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those artisans but for that you have to take part in this uiz competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will be aware of the fact that our Mann Ki Baat has accelerated the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time.
The efforts being made for cleanliness have always inspired the Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has set new parameters of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved an ideal position in the field of cleanliness, but the way Swachhta Abhiyan has been achieved in public places with the anti-Open Defecation campaign, it is the result of the will power of 130 crore Indians.
But we won't stop at all.
This movement has now stepped up from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news of Shri Yogesh Sainy and his team in the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer who left the US job to serve Mother India.
A few days ago, he took charge of making Delhi not only clean but also beautified.
He started the beautification work with his team from the Astakund of Lodhi Garden.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi are decorated with beautiful pictures.
From the overbridge and the walls of the school to the slums, when he made it beautiful, many more began to come forward and this way the work started moving forward.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I came to know that Yogesh Sainy and his team played a very big role in this work.
There may be no words in colors and lines, but the emergence of the Ramdhana that emerges with the help of them is more meaningful than thousands of words.
We have also observed this beauty in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important to try to make resources from waste to wealth in our lives.
That is, we have to move towards making gold from waste.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a charming statement at the Mai Gauv portal.
The statement was from the Sopian district resident brother Mohammad Asalam in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: 'Mann Ki Baat' is a pleasure to hear.
I am happy to note that I play an active role in organizing the Community Mobilization Programme Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I think this event should be organized every three months.
Online monitoring should also be organised.
I think this is the first such event where people could speak directly to the government.
After reading the message that brother Asalam ji sent me, my interest in knowing about the Back to Village scheme has increased, so I read it in detail and then I felt that it should be told to the whole country.
The people of Kashmir are interested in connecting with the mainstream of the country's progress.
They also knew whether the villagers are getting government services or not.
How can their income be increased
To make the programme more attractive, some other things were included.
Children's Sports Competition was organized under the Khelo India Scheme.
The event was distributed to sports equipment, MNREGA project workshop power cards and certificates for Scheduled Tribes and Tribes.
Economic Literacy Camps were opened and stalled by Government Departments such as agriculture, horticulture etc.
Thus, this event has become a development festival.
This was the festival of public participation, the festival of public awareness.
The common man of Kashmir was happy with this development festival.
Any officer was so impressed by the warm welcome given by the villagers that he left the village in the neighborhood of two days.
It is indeed a matter of great joy for the participation of a large number of people in the rural entrepreneurs in these areas and for the development of their own schemes.
This is a shining result of new enterprises and new resolutions.
Such programmes and peoples participation in it prove that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance, and the power of progress is always a proof of more e-stories than the power of bombs.
Those people who want to spread hatred and stop progress on the path of development will never succeed in their hatred, it is clear as the light of today.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandra, awarded the Gyanpeeth Award in a poem describing the form of Shravanamas in his poetry, said, "Hodige Madige, Agadalangna, Aadrag Bhoomi Magna, i. e.
Whenever we look around in this season, it seems as if the sanctuaries snatched green sheets.
This time Rakhibandhan is also celebrated with the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that when Shravan Month is going on, the maximum number of pilgrims have participated in the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1, till now.
More than the pilgrims who participated in this 60-day journey in 2015 have joined in just 28 days.
I would like to appreciate the success of Amarnath Yatra, especially the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who have returned from the journey have brought the people of that state with a warm memories of respect and hospitality.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that in Uttarakhand this year, more than 8 lakh pilgrims have visited Kedarnath Dham from the four Dham pilgrimages.
After a huge natural disaster in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I urge all of you to visit all those areas of the country where the beauty and rainy season is surprising.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage, it seems that there is no greater teacher than this.
I extend my best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and live month of Shravan will transmit new energy, new hopes and new enthusiasm amongst you all.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we saw TV, on the one hand, flooded all around the rain, water Thai, traffic jam.
Another picture of the rain where our farmers are enjoying the chirping of birds, the springs of waterfalls, the springs on the green sheets, you have to get out with your family.
Rain, freshness and happiness bring together both freshness and happiness, I wish this rain fills all of you with everlasting happiness.
My dear countrymen, where I start from Mann Ki Baat, where I stay, it seems to be a difficult task, but at the end, a limitation of time.
I'll be back after a month.
I convey my best wishes to all of you.
My young friends, you all are busy testing now.
Some people may have lost the test.
Some of the people are getting strained because on one hand, T-20 cricket world cups.
Even today, you may be waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons of both sides.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been getting downstairs.
Now our place has come down so low that we can't dare to say anything.
Throughout this year, we can create a football environment.
Our younger generation, our school children sweat at every corner of the country, schools and colleges.
There are very few people who go abroad, most of the people go somewhere in their own state for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people go out of the state.
Even before, I told you to upload the photographs wherever you don't go.
We have to take this task forward.
You still do the same thing, but now write something with him - not just a photo.
And it is said that 'A traveler without observation is a bird without wing'.
If you want to see good things, you have to make a look.
And I'm lucky, I got a lot of opportunity to travel.
When I was not the Chief Minister, I was not the Prime Minister, and I was a little older like you, I was very roaming around.
Perhaps there is no such district in India where I have no chance to go.
Tourism has a big role in creating life.
And now the youngsters of India are going to tourism with courage and compassion.
I believe it's a very good example.
Our younger generation should be brave, where no one has a foot, they should try to reach there.
I would like to specially thank Coal India.
So stay away.
When we see the pictures of the people there, we think what's the beneficiary of going there.
And it's a matter of fact that the coal is black, that's why people go away from the mine.
But that coal mine has been built as a tourist hub
And I am glad that this is the beginning of all, so far more than 10,000 people have seen the environment friendly mine tourism center in the village of Saon near Nagpur.
This place itself gives a chance to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on holidays, you can do some work on cleanliness.
Perhaps it doesn't work too scientificly, but it's happening.
Can you also not pay attention to the cleanliness of the tourism center as a tourist
I firmly believe that our young friends will definitely help in this regard.
Therefore, there is a lot of employment in tourism.
In comparison to other countries of the world, India is still far behind in tourism.
But if we believe that our tourism has to be strengthened then we can attract the world.
We can take a big part of the world tourism to ourselves.
And then it will be possible to provide employment opportunities to millions of young people of our country.
Whether it is the government or the institution or the society or the citizen, all these things have to be done together.
Come on, we do something for that purpose.
My young friends, the vacations come and leave - I don't like it.
Think about this.
Would you like to leave your holidays, important years of life, these important occasions
How many things I'm talking about - you can think.
Cannot you take a pledge to add any more quality to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know swimming, you can pledge to learn swimming on holidays.
If you don't know if you don't have a cycling, you can learn cycling on holidays.
Do something to enhance your personality, capabilities and efficiency on the occasion of holidays.
Not only the areas I talked about, but there is a greater opportunity to work outside.
Your personality will see how much your self-confidence will increase.
Friends, we'll talk about it.
There are some suggestions in the My Gov Portal for Mann Ki Baat this time.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I have enjoyed this work and my friendship with many birds on this occasion.
I urge you to repeat this in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this child in the name of Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Abhi told me he's doing this work all year and many birds have become his friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds very much.
In his poetry, he wrote: "Do not let you go away, I will fill up the garden, fill the sweet cold water.
Come, let us work on this word of Mahadevi Ji.
I congratulate Abhi, and I thank you- You have reminded me of very important things.
From Mysuru, Shilpa Cook has given us a very sensitivity.
Milky, news papers, postmans come near our house, he said.
Sometimes the utensils and the cloth sellers also go through that path.
Did we ever ask them to drink their water during summer, have we ever given them water
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot about Digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of the youth of the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone, you will have a lot of information about agriculture and weather.
The App has a lot of issues such as the condition of the market, the condition of the pikri market, how to provide good crops, the appropriate medicines, etc.
And if you put a question in front of them, they will answer it and will make you understand.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers before the start of agriculture.
Can't we find those old places once again, keep them clean, so that more water can be stored
Now you must have seen that efforts have been made to build 5 lakh ponds and ponds of farming land.
Under the MNREGA scheme, emphasis has been laid on creating resources through water conservation.
How to save water in villages and villages, every drop of rain can be conserved, every drop of water should be conserved in the village and how to start this awareness campaign.
You should join various government schemes in this regard so that a mass movement can be created for water conservation and water conservation.
There are many such villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers, there are many aware citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to move further.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you one more thing that a few days ago the Government of India had organized a big Krishi Mela.
I have seen how many modern technologies have come and brought about changes in agriculture.
But now these technologies will have to reach the farm of the farmers.
And now the farmers are saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I congratulate you for this kind.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our land sick.
But if good spices are given in large quantity, do you like to eat that
Whatever good fertilizer, the use of extra fertilizers will prove to be harmful.
Every thing needs to be used.
It costs less, it saves the money.
I hope that we will be able to complete this task with full focus on the need for water conservation.
The more water will be saved, the more the farmers will benefit and the more their lives will be saved.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
This year the theme of World Health Day is Beat Diabetes.
Diabetes is a disease that brings all other diseases to death.
Once there is diabetes, many sick guests enter their homes and body.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Three percent of deaths are diabetes.
Diabetes is two types - Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is hereditary, parents, children are likely to be born.
And Type 2 is due to bad exercises, old and extra weight.
The theme of World Health Day is Diabetes.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
Kayik's hard work is getting reduced.
There's no name for sweat.
It's not walking.
We're playing online.
Nothing's going on in offline.
If you are interested in yoga then do yoga.
Otherwise, at least race.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are easily available to the hands.
You must think about it.
Tuberculosis Day was celebrated on 24th March in the world.
When I was young, I was afraid to hear the name of tuberculosis.
But when Tuberculosis was due to death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care for TB.
The number of Tuberculosis patients in our country is much higher than the whole world.
If we have to get rid of Tuberculosis, we need proper treatment and holistic treatment.
If you leave medication, there is a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everyone around knows, they can also advise to check up.
This means that it is a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscope centres and more than 4 lakh DOTs providers.
Take proper treatment and continue treatment until the disease is cured.
I would urge you to defeat TB or diabetes.
India has to be free from these diseases.
But this will not be done only by the government, the doctors, the medicines until you come forward.
And that is why I urge the people of the country to come, defeat diabetes and get rid of tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, many important days are coming in April, especially on 14th April, on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th Birth Anniversary was celebrated all over the country with Dhum Dham.
His birthplace is a Maha of Panchtirth.
His studies in London, Diksha in Nagpur.
I am fortunate to be fortunate to visit the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14 this year.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to be a responsible citizen of the country.
Following that path, we can pay tributes to the responsible citizen of the country.
This festival is celebrated in different states with different names.
Some people call it 'Nav Samvashar', some 'Gudi-Parva', some 'Barsh Pratipada', some 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had said last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme can be heard in about 20 languages like your time whenever you can hear your mobile phone.
You just have to call a missed.
This facility has been just a month, and I am happy that about 35 lakh people have benefited from this.
You also write the number - 81908 81908.
I'm telling you again, 81908 81908.
I'm glad to be associated with you.
I also want to be your partner in this regard.
I have the same concern as you are concerned about your children's tests.
But if we change the process of our thinking about the examination, then perhaps we can be conscious.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send me your experience and your advice through the Narendra Modi App.
In my Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to speak specially to parents, examinees and teachers.
I want to talk about what I heard, what I read, what I said.
I know, the test is going to start in a few days.
How much number will you get in the exam
I want to say that you set some goals for yourself.
Don't put pressure on anyone else's desire.
You must work hard, but set a realistic and possible goal for yourself and try to touch this goal.
When I played cricket, I also had many hopes.
As the time has passed, people's expectations have also increased.
It was very important for me to find out a solution.
I thought I would expect myself and set my own goals for myself.
And if I set my goals myself and achieve that goal, then I can do something good for the country.
And I have always tried to achieve this goal.
I have always been aimed at saying that the goal has been fulfilled gradually.
And I believe that God will give you good results.
Good luck
Never fall under the pressure of hope.
You have to make your own future.
You decide your goal yourself.
Why would I waste your time to compete with others
Why don't I try to break my own records
Friends, don't think of the number of tests.
Life should always be driven to a great goal - a dream should be fulfilled, a promise should be made.
Whether we're walking on the right path, or whether we're walking properly, this test makes his hiseb-nicesh.
If there's some flaw in fulfilling the hopes, it won't be desperate.
Create a mindset to work hard and strive further.
Thousands of people have written small things on my app through mobile phones.
Shreya Gupta said that the healthy mind remains in the body.
Friends, You should also pay attention to health along with your studies so that you can get the test done properly.
However, our daily routine should be in accordance with our dreams and resolutions for 365 days.
I agreed with Shri Prabhakar Reddie, who told him to sleep at the right time and asked him to get up and revision.
Shri Prabhakar Reddy said that admission cards and other papers should be accessed to the examination centre.
I probably couldn't say this, because I'm a little sad about sleeping.
And when I talked about sleeping, I don't think I'm talking about sleeping for the test.
I don't understand the wrong, I'm talking about sleeping to be stress-free to get a good test at the time of examination.
You mustn't do that.
I believe you won't do that.
It is very important to strengthen the foundations of success and ethos in life.
A strong foundation of life is created from the ethos.
The strangers and disorders who do the morning work at noon, do the lunch work at night, feels that the work has been done.
That's why no one thinks it's small.
Do it properly, do it.
Friends, I saw sometimes the test takers two kinds.
One, those who have read, learned what was good, they take care of what was good.
Secondly, there's another kind of examiners who don't know what questions will come, what kind of questions will come, what can I solve
I have seen these two kinds of examinees.
There's a lot of tests with dad playing.
When you're playing, you don't know what rice you don't know, just as you don't know, you don't know.
If you're calm at work, eat properly, sleep sufficiently, you'll see that your brain can understand the right answer to the right question.
Look at this as a challenge, can I recall what I have learned for a year
So calm down, sleep well at night, don't be too self-sufficient, but it's not negative.
I've seen, you're better testing than you're afraid of the test.
So, be self-confidence and best wishes for you.
Vishwanathan Anand has really spoken very important.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that events of Arjun's life were only his eyesight on the bird's eyes.
I have seen the same way as Vishwanathan Ananda, who has full attention to the goal of sports and that is a reflection of his inner peace.
You shouldn't talk to friends - stay alone, be comfortable, reverse the leaves of a lot of books for the last minute, so you can never calm your mind.
That is why laugh - laugh with a lot of smiles and smiles with friends - see your mind will be calm.
But if the water is not calm, nothing can be seen.
And then I think that if you take a little rest, it would be good for me that's why I myself have developed a method.
Deep breathing - Breathing deep.
Three-five times breathe deep.
Sometimes it crosses 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes absolutely calm.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you too.
Because most of the time we see, we're trying to get rid of the tests, what's right, and what's wrong
If parents are educated at home, parents are teachers then they should write what I have written in the entire account.
We got stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
Whatever happened at the time of the test is done.
Interact with the family members on other matters, remember some smile of the day you leave.
Remember the scene if parents go somewhere with them.
Leave the exam at least half an hour.
In the present context, his views on the importance of Ramcharit Manas are trying to reach the world.
Revered Murari Bapu gave a lot of important suggestions for the students.
And whatever the situation, accept it.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy by recognizing the situation.
Without any stress, it will be successful to sit in the joyous mind.
And if you're successful, it'll never be sorry for failure.
We are grateful for the teachings given by the revered Murari Bapu for all of us.
Friends, today I want to talk another thing.
My mobile app is Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But Friends, If I say - start Yoga from tomorrow morning, then it will be done injustice to you.
But those who do yoga do not do it today, they do not do it.
If you are doing yoga, you must do it.
If you don't do yoga before exams, if you don't know about yoga then contact those people who can do yoga in two to five minutes.
Why hurry up for this
Make your entire day-to-day schedule in such a way that if the traffic jam is blocked then the timely test can be reached.
If not, such a situation creates anxiety in mind.
And one thing, the guidance in the question paper, maybe the time will be wasted when it reads.
I have seen that sometimes we can't understand it properly after getting the question papers, but if the guidelines are read well, we can follow it and fix it.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Rao stressed upon patience - in a very short term, he advised all the examinees.
That's what I say to my young friends.
At the same time, remember, there are many opportunities in our country.
Whatever you need is the power of jeed, self-sufficiency and engagement.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am extremely grateful to Rao Saheb that he has encouraged the children of the country, the words of determination, dedication, meditation are self-concentration, concentration and hard work.
Friends, stay on.
If you're engaged, you'll get scared.
A bright future is waiting for you to do good.
My app is interested in Dabus shared his experiments.
We all know about the inventor Thomas Alva Edison of Electric Bulbs, we read about him in our syllabus.
But today, the light of that bulb is illuminating the lives of human beings. That is why the seeds of success are found in failure.
He had no legislative education, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular in the world today.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
How many problems he had to face - how failing he has come.
The examination is not just for the students but also for the entire family, schools and teachers.
But without the collaboration of parents and teachers, the situation of the students is not favourable.
The test becomes easier if the teachers, parents and senior students are formed and united and moved forward with equality.
Mr. Keshav Vaishnav, he wrote my app, he complained that to get more numbers, the parents should not put more pressure on the students.
Just encourage to be ready.
They have to think that they're free of concern.
Vijay Jindal wrote, do not press the burden of your hope on the children.
Get their courage as much as possible.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure that our present lifestyle has changed a lot from our older generations, especially to my young friends.
We want to move forward with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am talking about this because today is the National Science Day.
Every year, on the day of February, we celebrate as National Science Day.
On February 1928, sir C.
Raman announced his discovery Raman Effect.
He won the award for this discovery.
This is the reason why the day of February was celebrated as the National Science Day.
Gentleman of questing science.
Scientific thinking, attraction for science creates new ideas and on the other hand it is not possible to create new ideas by excluding science and technology.
"I am C.
I salute Raman and urge all of you to enhance the interest of science.
Friends, Sometimes it is too late to succeed and when success comes, the vision of seeing the world changes.
I would like to remind the people of the country that you might have heard that there is a very important discovery in the field of science.
Our scientists have identified their capabilities as Gravitational Waves or great waves.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those scientists.
Our scientists will make efforts to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, in the past, we have taken an important decision.
There are only two places in the world.
India is the third.
I once again thank all the scientists and best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I tell you one number, you will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow with a missed call on this number.
You can also hear in your mother tongue.
Missed Call No. 81908 81908, I repeat: 81908 81908.
Friends, Your examination is going on.
I have to test tomorrow.
125 crore countrymen will take my tests.
29th February - It's Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen how healthy I am, how confident I am.
Tomorrow I will be tested - Parashu will start with you.
If we all succeed, the whole country will be successful.
Thank you very much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat event in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
A few days ago, we have done Christmaspalan, and now we are preparing to welcome the new year.
India is a diverse country.
There are several festivals here.
Sometimes it seems that India is such a country where the economy is connected with festivals.
Festival is a way of employment for the poor of the society.
I also convey my best wishes to all the people of Christmas and my best wishes to the people of the country for the new year 2016.
2016 brings a lot of happiness for all of you.
New joys, new hopes and new resolutions will reach your new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities, humanitarian disasters, all things are free of all.
You know I use technology completely, I know a lot from it.
Many go out to spend Christmas holidays.
The tourism sector is focused on other facilities, but he has attracted a special vision, where tourists travel and live, we should have a special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
The more clean our tourist destinations will be, India's picture will be shining in the world's courts.
I welcome Mr. Sauleshwarkar's thinking and deliver his words to the people of the country.
He has done a unique job, which has been printed in the newspaper.
That's why I think I'll get it to you.
Dilip Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if someone in the village adds the necessary equipment for the construction of toilets, then he will make toilets without any labour.
Considering this work as sacred, he has worked hard in the village of Bhojpura so far and has constructed 100 toilets.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Our country is sometimes heard of desperate things.
As a result of the collective efforts of all the people, our country is moving forward at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving together and taking the country forward.
We have been able to do all these things to improve education, new technologies and sustainable opportunities for livelihood, to provide banking opportunities to the citizens under insurance protection, to make a new reform in the era of doing business internationally and to develop infrastructure in new businesses.
The people of ordinary households who could not reach Dorgoda of the bank have access to loans easily through the Mudra Yojana.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to Yoga and when all the countries of the world came together through the International Day of Yoga, we believed that this is our country, the great India.
When this kind of feeling is created in our minds, a very amazing picture appears in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is being heard every household.
The participation of the people is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach these villages and bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit will be that all the government employees associated with this scheme will be encouraged and happy that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Whether it is not necessary to reach the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women and everyone
No government has worked, no government has worked, there is no need to reach the news that they should not be deprived of what they can get.
They must be informed about their own rights.
We must work towards delivering the right and good messages to the common man in large numbers.
It's a kind of service.
I've made a small effort to do it like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I say.
A common man can contact me by downloading the Narendra Modi App on his mobile phone.
You should also join this endeavour like you.
I want to reach 125 crore Indians, this is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all come together to encourage the common man to reach the good and privilege of the common man in common language.
My dear young friends, I start up India, stand up I from the Red Fort on 15th August.
Since then, it spreads to every office of the government that India can become a start-up capital.
There is a desire to have new ideas and new strategies for the world cannot move without new innovation energy.
There are talented young friends in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We will take this project forward to urge all the State Governments.
On January 16, I will meet you and discuss in detail, I will wait for your advice.
There are millions of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated as the National Youth Festival from January 12, 1997.
This year, the festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some advice about this young festival
My special request to the youngsters is to send your advice directly through the Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand your minds.
This will reflect on the National Youth Festival and I will give proper advice and information to my government.
Friends, I have been waiting for your views on Youth Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
In Ahmedabad, the visually impaired teacher of Gujarat, Dilip Chauhan celebrated the Accessible India Day in his school.
I have received a very encouraging step from the students and have been inspired to help the physically challenged persons in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dilipji, thank you very much.
You're working on it yourself.
You are well aware of their problems and you have faced a lot of problems.
When there is an opportunity to meet such people in the society then I have a lot of feelings.
According to our thinking, we express our vision towards their problems.
Some people become victims of accidents.
Then some people become victims of physical disabilities in birth.
A lot of words are being used to identify these people and there is a lot of thinking about these words.
But it always feels that the use of such words for these people is not right, it is not honorable.
It's right that the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Since I had to be present at that event, I had some thoughts about it.
During this time, I remember that God, who has given some incompleteness in his body or whose two organs do not work properly, we call him disabled and disabled.
But whenever I meet them, I can understand that there is some incompleteness in that person in our vision, but God gave him some extra power.
They are those people who have one or many organs that have divine power, which are not in the body of common man like us.
I like this word.
Can we propagate the word 'Dibang' instead of my request to the people of the country
On that day we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Physical and Virtual: I will try to facilitate the persons with disabilities by developing these two infrastructures.
We need many things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, slopes or ramps at railway stations, easy parking and lifting systems, braille scripts etc.
In our country, subsidy is given to gas cylinders.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
Through Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar Card etc., directly subsidies are available to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through the worlds largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
I am proud to tell the countrymen that it has been ranked in the Guinea Book of World Records for successfully launching the largest direct benefit scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG connections have been benefitted through Pahal scheme.
Today, the MNREGA scheme ensures employment for the rural people.
There were several complaints about the funding of the project.
Now, in most places, this money is directly reaching the bank account of the labourers.
There was a lot of problem with the money of scholarships for the students.
This system has also been started for them and it will gradually be taken forward.
The beneficiaries of various schemes have reached directly to the bank accounts of about Rs. 40,000 crore.
According to a general calculation, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, Republic Day on 26th January.
It is a matter of happiness that this year, the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the form of the Constitution.
It is a very good experience to discuss the Constitution for two days in the session of Parliament.
Equal emphasis has been laid on duties in the Constitution.
There is a lot of duties in voting, but why will not it be a matter of duty in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, what can we not organise a competition for discussions and poetry on our primary duty in schools, colleges, villages, cities and various social organizations
I have a new feeling in my mind that before 26th January, you can send me poems in your mother tongue or in English or Hindi.
I want to be aware of your thinking.
My gov can send it to the portal.
I am very keen to know about the duties of the youth of our country.
I want to make a small proposal.
On 26th January, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we not take the country's citizens and school-college students to make the images of the great men established in our cities clean and pursued and maintain the cleanliness of the replica adjoining areas
I'm not talking about the government system.
As a common citizen, we are enthusiastic and emotional about the replica of these great men.
Can we not make it our common habit for the society, for the country
Come on this 26th January, let us all work together towards the cleanliness of these images made in honor of the great men.
For this, the common man and the citizens have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to all of you for the new year 2016.
Thank you all
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
With a new zeal, business and employment generation will also start.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove condolences, sometimes it creates new enthusiasm.
But sometimes whenever there is a crisis during the festival, it becomes very painful.
News of natural mishaps are coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that have never heard or thought before.
My condolences and condolences to all these families during these calamities.
The State Government is using all powers in rescue and relief.
The central government also works shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Now a team of rescuers of the Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I believe that in spite of this danger, Tamil Nadu will move forward at a rapid pace with new enterprises and will play its role in taking the country forward.
When this disaster is happening all around, the need to stop it is also increasing.
Now his form has changed.
Our capacity building has become very important in every field.
The government, the educational society, the people and all the small organisations have to work as capacity building in a scientific manner.
I am happy that this initiative was inaugurated through a seminar and workshop on a table toxic exercise and excellence from all the countries in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of the farmers not only in biotechnology but also in a big way.
It is our nature and generations that are burning the roots of crops.
First, there was no idea of the damage caused by this thing - we are doing the same thing.
Secondly, there was no training for other methods.
When the impact of these calamities began to fall on the city, people began to become easier against it.
The sorrow you've expressed is worthwhile.
First of all, our farmer brothers and sisters have to be trained properly.
When the roots of the crop are burnt, the time will be saved, the hard work will be saved, the crop will be ready for the next crop but it is not right.
The roots of the crop are very precious.
It's a biological fertilizer.
We're burning the food and destroying it.
This is not finished, if these roots are squeezed, it can also be cattle feed.
The upper level of agricultural land is burning to burn this root.
Our fertilizers burn the surface of our land, which puts our fertilizers to death.
And that's why we have to play a vital role.
See the root of this crop mixed in the ground, it will be cured.
If these biological fertilizers are used in that land, then there is double profit.
I once had the opportunity to talk to the artists.
They spoke of a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate banana, they used to spend five thousand rupees per hectares, sometimes ten or fifteen thousand rupees per hectares to clean the roots of banana.
If the tractor was not available to clean it, the roots would have fallen the same way.
Some farmers then put these roots in six or eight inches of measurement and sowed them on the ground.
Because there is so much water in the roots of that banana, where they are planted, if there are any trees, trees or crops, there is no need to give water separately for three months.
The water in the roots of banana keeps the crops safe.
Those who had to spend their money for cleaning the roots, now they are earning from it.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on December 3, the entire world will celebrate International Disability Day.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I talked about organ donations.
I also spoke of NOTO's helpline for organ donation.
The National Organ Donation Day was celebrated on 27th November.
Chitravinetri Ravina Tandon and many distinguished persons from the society have joined it.
Organ donation can save many precious lives.
It can bring immortality in a similar way.
When some part of the body is transplanted from one body to another, it brings a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What could be greater than this
A national level competition was organised through MyGov in Portal to create slogans for Notor Logo, Donor Card and this.
Physical and mentally challenged people have unlimited courage and capabilities.
But if we change our vision, change our mindset towards them, then they can become an inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying even if we're in small problems.
That is why they are a source of inspiration for us.
I appreciate the indomitable effort to transform their lives into a resolution, energy, the way they fight with their lives and problems.
I want to talk to Jabhav us today.
The terrorists had to explore some parts of kidneys, intestines and abdomen.
There was also a serious injury to the spinal cord.
The ability to stand on his feet was finished like him, but Jabhav didn't accept the ratio.
The injury of the terrorists couldn't drive him.
Without any reason, a innocent person is suffering from this kind of life and life crisis, but without expressing any anger or anger, Jabhav Ahmad faced these calamities with sensitivity.
This is his biggest mental determination and he has appointed his life in the service of the society.
Not always in power, but for the last twenty years, he has been employed for teaching children.
MA in social science and as a social worker and conscious citizen, today we are making a quiet revolution as the ambassador of the disadvantaged.
Can people from every corner of India get inspiration from the narrative of Jabhad
I will specially remember his self-confidence in the life, penance and human service of Javed Ahmad on December 3.
At times, I am just talking about enlightenment, but I know that the lamps that are burning in every corner of India will give a new light to life and give a new direction to life.
On December 3, all such inspiring people should be remembered.
Our country is a big country.
There are many such things that people depend on the government.
The Government and the Government have regular relations with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalit, the afflicted, the underprivileged and the deprived.
We have a network of hope workers across the country.
He has done a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria disease.
Yamuna Manising, a hope worker from this village, has decided that no one in his own village will die due to malaria.
Even if there is a small fever in the village, you should reach that house immediately.
He started treatment on the basis of the preliminary treatment taught to him.
Emphasizing the use of pesticides in every household.
Just as one needs to sleep and take care of ones children, Yamuna Manising has dedicated itself to save the entire village from mosquitoes and has prepared all the villages to prevent malaria.
How many such Yamuna Monisings are there.
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to see them in their respect.
They can become many big powers of the country.
Our companions of happiness and sorrow all the time.
I would like to honour all aspirational persons through Yamuna Manising.
First on Swachh Bharat, second on Adarsh Village Parliament and third on Health.
I urge you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You can read these things and remember something to do with it.
You must send it to the MyGov portal.
There are many such incidents that we don't look at, but there is a real power for society.
The right example is our biggest strength.
I urge you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Global warming, climate change is now the most fascinating and anxiety, and it is recognised as an index before doing everything.
The temperature of the world should not grow anymore - it should be everyone's concern and responsibility.
The first way to prevent temperature rise is energy conservation.
Once I had said that on the night of the full moon, the light of the road should be closed and the light should be bathed for hours after saving electricity.
The moon's rays should be felt.
Any friend sent me a link of such a sight and had the opportunity to see him.
A woman named Nurjahan in Kanpur, who cannot understand on TV that she has got a lot of opportunity to study, has done such a thing that nobody really thought.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar power from sunlight.
He is fighting with darkness and brightening his name.
People take lanthons in the evening, give them back to charge in the morning.
Approximately three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
The Nurjahan recharged the lanterns through this solar power in the factory all day.
Look, the big people of the world are doing a lot for climate change, but it seems that they can inspire everyone, they are doing the same thing.
In the same way, the name of Alexander Jahan is to illuminate the world.
In this way, he is spreading light.
I would like to congratulate the Honble Prime Minister ji for launching a scheme with the Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is Fund the Unfunded.
However, the speed at which I want to move ahead is still left.
Most of the beneficiaries of the STs, STs and Other Backward Classes, who are working hard on their own and are trying to run their families with respect.
Solomon himself spoke of his zeal.
I've got a lot of news.
There's a man just told me, there's somebody named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He has received loans of Rs. 8.
And he started cleaning the system.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I said that this campaign will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did this.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be further promoted.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small traders.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
The people employed in small work are the real power of the country's economy.
We want to focus on it.
Good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I spoke of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our society.
Internal Vigilance is the Prize of Liberty - Rashtrayam, Awakening, Veryam - Internal Vigilance is the Prize of Freedom.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, the Internal Safety River has to be immersed.
I would like to make Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat a plan, and I had also agreed on this in the portal.
I've been told that there's a lot of suggestions.
I am told that the certificates will be given to those who participate in this.
Large awards have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter season starts.
It's a very good time to wear food and various dresses.
Then I'll tell you, exercise.
At least one hour of family members should work together and see what kind of awareness will increase and how fresh it will take all day.
Let's get good habits in good weather.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
This is the twelfth festival of Mann Ki Baat and it has been a year to see this.
I was fortunate to speak in Mann Ki Baat for the first time on October 3 last year.
Democracy has a great glory of manpower.
I have a natural concern in my life and that's why I have unprecedented faith in the people's power.
What Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can say that the strength of the people is much more than that.
Our ancestors spoke of the masses, saying they are part of God.
I can tell you about the feelings I have from Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have great power in thinking, there is a great truth because I have experienced it.
I have sought advice from everyone for Mann Ki Baat, but perhaps every time I have been able to see or understand two suggestions.
But millions of people are actively advising me.
It's a funny power.
And like this, Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing its own thinking of society.
I once talked about selfie with Daughter.
And that's why the whole world was amazed.
But the picture of Daughter with lakhs of selfies from all over the world has come and the daughters have become proud of it.
And when they took the daughter with self, they not only made their daughters proud, but also awakened a resolution within themselves.
And when all these selfies are seen, everybody feels that they also have to quit depression towards the daughter-in-law.
People from every corner of India have sent such pictures to millions of people.
The state government or the tourism department of the central government could not even imagine that we have such invaluable resources in our country.
It's a little bit less like we're not khadi's.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that the sale of khadi has almost doubled in the last one year.
And it wasn't for any public advertisement.
Crores of rupees have not been spent for this purpose.
This was a belief of Jan Shakti, a feeling.
I urged the financially rich people to demonstrate the subsidy you have for gas cylinders.
On a TV channel, I saw a widow, a retired teacher, standing on the line of grant of gas cylinders.
The middle class, the lower-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-midddle-middle-mid-middle-middle-middle-middle
Isn't this a silent revolution
As much as the government works with the people, it can work as a good instrument for the betterment of the society.
The people of my country are trying to dedicate themselves to the welfare of the country by giving importance to every small thing.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to take a new initiative.
Be it Siachen, Kutch or Kamrupi or Kanyakumarika from Kashmir, there is no such place in India where people did not call.
It's my own pleasure.
People of all ages have called.
I've heard some phones myself and I like it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
They gave full positive suggestions, positive advice.
You can see how positive the common man of the country is, this is a big wealth for the country.
One or two percent of the phones may have been a serious complaint.
And one thing has come to us, especially the persons with disabilities, has received a lot of phone calls.
One of the reasons for this can be that since they do not have the opportunity to watch TV, they must listen to the radio.
This makes me understand how important the radio is for blind people.
I have got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important to make the government more sensitive.
Pawan Acharya gave me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people of the entire country should listen to it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I live in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that your suggestions will spread in every corner of India at the pace of air.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army.
I have spent time with the soldiers of the Navy, Army and Air Force, Air Force, Air Force and Navy, who have protected the water, land and airways.
What wasn't there - the whole history has been survivorized.
The glorious moments that we have heard of the indomitable courage and sacrifices of our armed forces can be achieved through this exhibition because there was no picture of that time, videography was not possible.
Haji Peer's fight or the fight for the north of the country, the sight of Chaminda's fight or Haji Peer Pass, whatever you see, is a thrilling feeling and pride for our soldiers.
This exhibition will last for a few more days.
I urge all of you who live around Delhi to see this exhibition with your family and not hurry like me.
Look at the power of democracy, a young boy is ordering the Prime Minister, but the younger boy has forgotten to call his name soon.
We should make cleanliness a habit and take appropriate arrangements for it.
I also have to hear a lot of things that Modiji has spoken a big deal about cleanliness, but what is happening till the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
The movement that has been created with cleanliness, the atmosphere of hatred towards waste, the awareness that has come about cleanliness will also force this government to work for making a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Bodies - Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Pur Nigam, Mahanagar Paur Nigam or State or Centre - will have to work in this regard.
And when we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will move forward in the right direction to achieve the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi once said that if I like one of these two, then I would first like cleanliness and after independence.
Sanitation was more important for Gandhiji than for independence.
Let us follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfil his wishes.
He wanted to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the philosophy of life of great men is a source of inspiration for us.
Sometimes it is associated with the name of a great man in a historical view.
In the coming days, we will remember these great personalities, their philosophy of life will reach every household and we will try to learn something from it.
I would specifically mention October 2 that day, the birth anniversary of the revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year that you have different fashion clothes, different kinds of fabrics, many other things, but Khadi's materials should have a special place.
And that's why in this Deepawali, we'll surely give us a place in our house, we'll wear khadi clothes.
And look, last time the sale of khadi clothes doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government can not spend lakhs of crores of rupees through advertisements has been made possible with your small help.
This is the Jan Shakti and that is why I request you for this work again.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I wish you would also be a part of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in May, some of the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose had come to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
A lot of time was spent with the people of Subhash Babu's family.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Perhaps they all come together to the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
But the most happy thing for me is that I have never got the opportunity to host such a hospitality at the Prime Minister's residence in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu, who live in different countries, are all coming.
Bhagvi Kande sent me a message, listening to his words, his voice, I felt he was going to be a friend, or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware about the registration of voters, which will enhance the contribution of the youth in the coming days and make the youth a significant contribution in forming and managing the government in the future.
Thank you, Shri Vargavi said on the issue of recording and voting in the electoral rolls.
Every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is gradually increasing.
A few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission used to conduct the election process, but in the last few years, there has been a major change.
Today, our Election Commission is not just an electorate, a helper, a electorate-friendly, and the electorate is the centre of all the schemes.
But only the Election Commission will work, it won't work.
I hope that if the youngsters of the country do not register their names in the electoral roll, they will definitely register and vote.
I speak openly on the day of election, "Voting in the field, then drinking water".
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
I've visited Kashi last year.
I have met many people, several events have happened, many have met but I want to tell you about two boys.
But at such a young age, his interest in physiotherapy has surprised me.
I think he reads a lot, surfing the Internet, knows about the new use of science.
How to get rid of rail accidents, how to reduce the cost of energy, how to experience robots etc.
It's like a small boy named Sonmpetel.
Sonam is nine years old.
I was surprised that the whole Gita was the girl's familiar, but the most important thing is that when I asked her, she used to describe in English as Shlok, she used to describe Shlok and listened to Hindi as well.
I told her to ask her father that she's doing this work since the age of five.
I asked him about his studies, didn't he read only Geetha
The gentlemen said, "No, Sonamadi, once from Ank to the evening, all the lessons are finished, and if history is finished, then it's in the evening.
They're astonished about the girl, she's just like that in the family.
I'm really impressed.
Sometimes there's a hobby of celebrity in children, and there's nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given it some special strength.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
I have to make a lot of time to do this event once a month.
Sometimes our Akashwani friends have to wait for half an hour and half an hour.
One year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
You know how much Subhash Babu used to use radio
He started his radio broadcasting from Germany and used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He launched the Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
The radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pustu, Portuguese etc.
Listen to you, think for you, consider your proposals, and from that my thoughts are opened, which reaches you through Akashwani.
I say, but it's yours, and it's my satisfaction.
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you at the Mann Ki Baat.
The people of the far-flung South India are now celebrating the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy Rakhi Bandhan festival.
The Government of India has started several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am happy that in a short span of time many people have come under these schemes.
I had requested a small request that on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan festival, our sisters should be given a similar protection scheme.
I have received a lot of information, which shows that since the inception of the scheme, 11 crore families have been associated with it.
I have also been told that about half of the benefits have been received by parents.
Today, when I was talking to you, a year ago, Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up.
Several questions were raised that the work that didn't take place in sixty years, would it be in such a short time
This has also helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1 lakh 31 thousand Financial Literacy Campaigns have been opened to unite the banking sector, the economy and the lower sections.
This belief has been created that even the poor people can get the money from the bank.
I once again thank all those who are associated with this and urge the poorest brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts, you will not let this relationship separate from the bank.
This bank is yours, you won't leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, now it's your responsibility to hold it.
We have to keep all of us accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you keep it.
A few days ago, the violent incident of Gujarat has embarrassed the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the state of Gandhi and Sardar Patel then the whole country is sad and sad.
But in a short span of time, my brothers and sisters of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing the situation and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to shoulder for the right path and progress.
Prosperity is a solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the scholars of Sufi stream.
I am really telling you that this experience of listening to those great words has brought me a musical experience.
The words of those pundits, the practice of speaking to them, that is, the tradition of peaceful generosity in the Sufi stream has reached me like a musical line.
I'm very good.
Perhaps it is the most important thing to bring this true form of Islam to the world of copper.
I believe that the words of love and generosity of Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the entire humanity and Islam will benefit.
I say to others, even though we are different communities, we need to understand the spirit of Sufi.
I am going to have another opportunity in the coming days and I feel myself fortunate to get this invitation.
Pundits of Buddhism from many countries of the world are coming to Buddha Gaya in India and will discuss various issues related to humanity all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars who have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddha Gaya.
This is a moment of joy for me to meet the world's scholars.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you, especially to you.
I have already spoken about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
You people have heard it in the Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat.
I am telling you one thing every time that the government's mind is open on the issue of the dispute over the Land Acquisition Act.
I have often said that I have agreed to take any suggestion for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I would like to tell the farmer brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I saw that a lot of misconceptions have been spread in this regard, the farmers have been scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never misunderstand and will never get scared.
I don't want to give anyone a chance to misunderstand or fear the farmers.
I need every demand of the country, but the demand of the farmers is most important.
I've decided to let this end.
That is, the position that was before my government was formed came back.
But one thing was incomplete.
There were 13 such matters that had to be completed in a year and that is why we brought the Ordinance, but the matter was incomplete.
We are the mantra of the welfare of the poor and the farmers in the villages.
Therefore, I had said on 15th August that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are trying to transform this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for confusion now, there is no reason for doubt.
If someone tries to scare you, you won't be afraid.
I have another word.
Two days ago, the war of 1985 was completed 50 years ago.
Whenever the war of 1985 comes to light, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also natural to remember Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is very natural to remember the sacrifices made by all those who have been martyred to maintain the pride and respect of the three-coloured national flag of India.
I salute all those associated with Indias victory of 65 and bow down to the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us every time.
I am very happy that India is doing well in many fields of science.
Our scientists are actually doing well.
I have seen how young scientists are talking with zeal and enthusiasm, I have seen a new dream in their eyes.
In the Mann Ki Baat programme last time, I had said that our students should move forward towards science.
After this interaction with the scientists, I felt that there are many opportunities and opportunities in this field.
I am happy that in just 15 days, the government has started working in this regard in a short span of time.
The directives are being issued and it is expected that the interview system will be delivered to small jobs.
Guests from many countries of the world have come here in India.
24 countries of the world united and agreed to take Indias Call to Action Plan to reduce health, especially mother and child mortality.
This is the first time in any other country outside America.
It is true that even today we die every year about 50,000 mothers and about lakhs of their children during delivery or afterwards.
It's very worrying and scared.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India's appreciation has started at the international level, yet this number is not less.
As we have got rid of polio, we have also got rid of death due to tetanus of mother and child.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save our mothers and newborns.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting a lot of news today.
It's right that dengue is very dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It has a direct link with the Swachh Bharat that I speak of.
We watch advertising on television on dengue, advertising is printed in news papers, but we don't pay attention to it.
There are rules to keep the small things clean and keep the water clean.
Peoples education has started on a large scale but we are not paying attention to it.
Sometimes it seems that we stay in a very clean house, a very good arrangement, but do not care that I invite dengue to the water that is accumulated in my own house.
I would urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very precious.
It's not right that the filthy feelings around the surroundings of the filthy water will be a cause of death.
Dengue tests are available at around 514 centers across the country.
Examining in time is extremely important to keep death intact.
Your cooperation in this regard is immense.
Cleanliness has to be given immense importance.
Now there will be several festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepawali.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to hear a happy news.
I often say that now it is not fortunate to give life to our country but it is fortunate to live for the country.
Two youngsters of my country, two brothers of Nasik, Maharashtra, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced Indias pride.
There's a bicycle race in the United States, Race Acres America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am very happy that these two brothers have succeeded through the aim of 'Tim India Vision for Tribals' i. e.
See how everyone is trying at the personal level to take the country forward.
When I hear these things, my heart swells up.
Occasionally, we have done injustice to the new generations due to old meditation.
Old generations believe that new generations don't know anything, this meditation has been going on for centuries.
I have met many youngsters who have killed Sunday on cycle their lives.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful to protect my body, health and environment.
And I'm a young man, it's good to think.
Cycling is going on in many cities of our country and there are many people who are encouraging cycling.
It is a good effort to protect the environment and improve health.
Today, when two young people of my country hoisted the national flag in the United States, I am happy to mention the way the thoughts and thoughts of the youth of India are going on.
I would like to extend my best wishes to the Maharashtra government today.
The construction of the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar on the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
At the same time, we bought the 10th house of King Henry Road in London and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
The Government of Maharashtra will build a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for Indians who travel around the world.
I congratulate both the efforts of the Maharashtra government for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar, I am proud and I congratulate them.
This year it's nice to start the rain.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will help in harvesting kharif.
And I'm very happy to remind you of a happy news.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
I want pulses for the poor, I want a little oil to make rice for food.
I am happy to note that the crops that have been produced today have grown by about 50 percent and the oilseeds have grown by about 33 percent.
My dear countrymen, on 26th July, Kargil Vijay Diwas has been marked in the history of our country.
The closer relationship between the farmers and the land of the country is the same for the soldiers of our country.
The war of Kargil was not only on the borders of the country but also on this war, every city of India, every village of India was connected to this war.
This war was fought by mothers and sisters who fought with the enemies of their young sons or brothers in Kargil.
Today, for their sacrifices, India is able to speak highly in the world.
I have a pledge to further enhance the direct participation of the people in democracy, to make every person work for the betterment of the country. And today I am glad that about two crore people have seen the MyGov portal.
Why cannot reservation be kept for persons with disabilities while booking train tickets through RCTC website
Now this thing is very small, but it has never been considered by the government or has not been discussed.
However, the government has considered this thing with great importance and today this system has been started for our brothers and sisters.
The Logos that are being built today, the tag lines are being created, the plans are being prepared, the policy is being formulated - MyGov portal has a positive opinion.
There is a feeling of a new clean air in the governance system.
A new consciousness.
On 15th August, there are several suggestions in the Edening MyGov portal.
Suchitra Raghavchari sent a lot of opinions from Chennai.
You can send MyGov to the portal, write letters in Akash Vani, write letters in the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I mean it's a good thing to get advice from the public for my speech on August 15.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I have seen an accident scene in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver has been scattering for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when we look at the statistics, we feel sorry.
Our country has an accident every minute.
For accidents, one death occurs every 4 minutes for accidents.
And the biggest concern is that one-third of all these dead people, who are 15 to 25 years old, can destroy the entire family.
They will do the work that should be done by the administration but I will urge parents that your child should be a driver of the two-wheeler or a for-wheeler, every effort should be made by the family for caution.
Sometimes I have seen, I have written behind the auto rickshaw, "Do not come home soon" (Baba hurry back to home)
And that is why I am telling you that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education for road safety or be it technologies for road construction, be it administrative system or be it emergency treatment for the injured persons after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill.
In the coming days, I think of taking some important steps for the use of National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
I have taken another project which will expand all the highways of the country from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Badodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon, Mondia.
I am thinking of a cashless treatment system for the first 50 hours after the accident - whether the injured person has the money or not, who will not pay, who will not pay the money or who will not pay.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033, ambulance to report the accidents across the country, but all these are the steps after the accidents.
Sometimes I say that employees are employed.
I want to tell you that in the last few days some events have come to my notice, which I like.
Vijay Vishwal showed how his interest, his own industry and his capabilities can be linked to his work.
There may be a lot of discussions, discussions and discussions on Vijay Vishwaal's pictures in the coming days.
I remember one more thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started such a work in the entire district which has touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters in Rakhi Bandhan festival so that no mother and sister of the entire district should go to the open space.
I knew a news that I wanted to share with you.
There is a small village named Kesla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for the construction of toilets for the last few months.
Now no one in this village has to make an open defecation.
After the completion of the construction of toilets, the people of the entire village celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is an example of how the values of the society are changing, how the mindset needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
About North-Eastern India, Bhavesh Decca of Guwahati has written to me that the people of North-Eastern India are very active in the functioning of the people.
They're writing a lot - it's a good thing.
I am happy to tell them today that there is a separate ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, there was a separate ministry called Development of North East Region (D-O-N-E-R).
After the formation of our government, our Donar Department has taken an important decision that the development of Northeast India is not possible by sitting in Delhi.
Everybody decided that a team of officials of the Government of India will go to the North-Eastern states like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and will be camping for seven days.
We need to move ahead with the efforts that I am calling the Act East Policy to reach the East from Delhi.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of the Merce Mission and we are proud of it.
In the last few days, Indias PSLV C28 successfully launched five satellites of Kingdom.
All these news come for a few moments, and go back.
We don't normally remember these.
But sometimes we think that today when we talk to the younger generation, we want to know what they want to happen in the future, one or half of the 100 students who say, I want to be a scientist.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Research Campaign in a new talent.
Now we have to charge the mobile, but we have to go to other villages.
All the facilities available in the city should also be available in the villages.
That is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I have started it, I will finish it, today I have the desire to talk about various things.
On one hand, our country is celebrated as the month of August-September.
Many festivals are also celebrated.
My best wishes to all of you.
You must send your advice for August 15.
Your opinions will help me a lot.
Thank you innumerable
When I said, I didn't think I'd get such a remarkable deal.
Millions of people have posted photographs in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
After one I saw a photo, how many diversities are there in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
I think that the government of India has not been able to think about tourism.
And I like some pictures so much that I tweeted myself again.
I think we couldn't know that if we don't have a photograph post in the Velam Cave of Andhra Pradesh, we might not know that the place that is hidden in our country.
I think there was no country where the sun rays had reached the world where the sun was not welcomed by yoga.
I can assert that the sun does not set in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the way people of the world have respected and self-relianted Yoga.
I'm too happy.
The Sin River and Eiffel Tower are a symbol of pride for the French people, who have preferred that place for yoga and have also given equal respect to Yoga.
In New York's Times Square, people have done yoga.
When we talk about Australia's Sydney, the picture of Opera House appears in front of the eyes.
The people of Australia have done Yoga at Opera House and have shown Yoga equal respect to Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Milan's Diomo Cathedral - Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
I am very happy that when the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-Mun, had practiced Yoga in the UN Headquarters on 21st June.
Similarly, members of the United Nations Peace Defence Force have performed very beautiful yoga practices.
In Siachen, our army has joined the grassroots of white ice in India, the naval personnel have participated in the yoga programme wherever we were naval personnel.
In Delhi, Yoga has been ranked in the Guinnessbook of World Records.
It looks like a new question from everywhere in the world - a new joy, a new zeal, a new unifying feeling is emerging.
A few days ago, when I tweeted a photo of Yoga for a small family of Vietnam, that photo was so beautiful that it was praised all over the world.
Women, children and elders, rural and urban, developed or developing countries all have associated themselves with Yoga.
Yoga has really tied the whole world in a way.
I don't know how scholars and scholars will look at this event but I feel one thing, every Indian can be proud that the world is willing to know India.
Everybody's interest has increased to know India.
Indias values, traditions and traditions want to know the world.
The responsibility of all of us is to accommodate this legacy.
We can do this if we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so much aware that we don't see any innovation in it like our family values, we don't know our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why should we not introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe that the world will be amazed - I will be surprised to believe that there are many such best things that the ancestors have given us.
The success, joy and satisfaction of International Yoga Day has brought a new responsibility.
It is our responsibility to provide a good Yoga teacher to the world.
I believe that you can create a database about where to learn Yoga, where to get Yoga teachers.
I have seen the events of the past in another vision and we have seen that the government is working, the government is very active and what is the result of the goal if the goal is fixed.
When there was disappointment all around us, as we heard a year ago, nothing will happen - nothing will happen.
AYUSH is a part of the government.
Nobody gave any importance to this
However, on the day of Yoga Day, this small department has led the leadership and has organized such a big event all over the world smoothly.
If the goal is fixed, the smaller sections can also do good work - this is the sample of it.
A few days ago, the world has seen how our people protected people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have moved forward to help Nepal.
If the government is active then all the bank employees come forward to open the Jan Dhan Account and within a few days millions of Indians are connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools to build toilets in the Red Fort and said that we will have to complete this work by the next 15th of August.
It was a brave task to fulfil the work that was not possible in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government workers, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, I started three Jan Suraksha Yojanas from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been associated with Jan Suraksha Yojana, even though we have to move forward.
Rakhibandhan is coming in the month of August.
Would we not be able to provide the benefits of Jan Suraksha Yojana to our mothers and sisters by creating a strong Jan Andolan before this festival together
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, it can be a great gift to sisters on behalf of brother.
When I come to the Mann Ki Baat programme, many people sent me advice.
Many people have sent me advice that I should talk about the rain.
From Nagpur to Yogesh Dandekar, from Mysore to Harsh Vardhan Mahasay, Praveen Nadkarni Mahasay, Divya Anshu Gupta Mahasay - everyone told me to talk about rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This weather enjoys the mind.
People of any age want to enjoy the first rain water.
You are also enjoying hot tea with hot pockets, nuts and buffaloes in this year.
As the sun rays give us life force, the rain gives us strength.
Point water is also precious.
As a citizen, as a human being, we have to make a habit of saving drops of water as well.
The water of the village will remain in the village, the water of the city should be in the city.
Rain water harvesting is not a new thing for centuries.
Check dams, watershed development, small ponds, small field reservoirs, whatever we may have to save the drop of water.
This port is on the coast of the sea, so rain water was collected for sweet water and kept in the house.
At that time, so much efforts were made to conserve rain water.
We can do that too.
And I advise you from my direct and successful experience.
It's a complete rural technologies.
When you plant trees, then put an old soil bud near the tree and fill it with water.
Filling water once or twice a month.
See, this tree will grow very quickly and will be very strong.
I will also tell the farmers that you don't plant trees around your fields.
And we also know that in the rainy season, the disease spreads more through water.
The bacteria become active due to the increase in moisture in the weather.
Therefore, cleanliness is extremely important at this time.
Pure drinking water should be consumed at this time.
It's right, as much as we be careful, the disease will be far away.
I want water, rain, but I want to prevent diseases.
My countrymen, we have recently started three new projects, especially for the citizens of the city.
There are less than five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And I want to stay in this house to have electricity, drinking water, toilets and schools to study the children.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give every countrymen a home.
I have been associated with all of you through social media.
I have received many new ideas and suggestions from you and I have a lot of opinions about the work of the government.
But when this government scheme becomes a project for a person, a society or a village, then the strength of it increases.
In the past, Shriman Sunil Jaglan Mahasay, a Panchayat Chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, has started a very funny effort.
And this creates an atmosphere that every father would take a selfie with his daughter to post on social media.
In Haryana, the number of bullocks is very low than the boys.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there are such conditions, which are very worrying.
Haryana is the worst.
And therefore, I urge you to participate with your daughters in the Self-With Dotter.
To further strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write taglines, write beautiful taglines, it can be in any language or English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will re-tweet your selfie with your daughter.
In a similar way, we can make Beti Bachao Beti Padhao a mass movement.
Make our country rice.
I am telling you from my experience, this effort will be taken forward.
Make it a part of your life.
And one more thing - Incredible India - wherever you go, you will definitely send the pictures there.
How many diversities are there in our country.
I think the pictures you're sending are very low.
You can also post the pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
Several things are manufactured in your cities - the poor people also produce many things.
And we have a simple medium with which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is the same today.
The next Mann Ki Baat will talk to you again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I should declare a big scheme of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
This is my pleasure that I am talking to you with a little bit of tightness through this programme.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You imagine what's going on in the middle.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that the words were also mine, the voice of the throat was also mine, but the words were for you, for men, for you and for you.
But this Sunday waited for me a lot.
Well, the chance has come to the end.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat i. e.
My quiet exchange with you, I had an experienced part of this spiritual journey.
Many people asked me why I went to Kedarnath in the busyness of voting.
You have the right and I understand your curiosity.
I think I'm talking about the situation of that time sometimes.
But today I think that if I talk about these things then it will change the form of Mann Ki Baat.
You're busy with the vote, the estimation of the defeat and the polling remaining when I got out.
Most of the people found it politically.
But this was my chance to meet myself.
I could say I went to meet me.
I don't know when I can say, but I'll tell you, because you have the right to me.
The way people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have always felt a positive energy in your efforts.
Sometimes some of your words enhance my thinking.
Like people speak about the challenges faced by the country and the society, they also suggest solutions to it.
I have noticed that there is a description of the problem in the letter, but there is also a feature that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
He expressed his distress over the waste and welcomed the efforts towards cleanliness.
Whenever somebody speaks of the environment, he feels the problem of pollution and also speaks of his own efforts.
He also mentioned the way they are being taken, and the imagination that they have kept in mind is to prevent environmental pollution.
That is, the solution to the problem is a glimpse of how it is possible with the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is a vision for the country and society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of inner energy, capability and talent among the people of the country.
It is only necessary to guide the energy and talent in the right way, to give it a chance, to use it.
Mann Ki Baat also says that the energy and activity of 130 crore people of the country has to be linked to the progress of the country.
I would certainly say one more thing that in the Mann Ki Baat I have a lot of letters, many phones come, many messages come, but there is a lot of complaints, somebody wants something to get something for myself, I don't think it has happened once in the last five years.
You can imagine that no one is writing letters to the Prime Minister of the country but don't you want anything for yourself
This is an example of the high thinking of millions of people of the country.
Today my heart is full of happiness.
And that's why I have easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will come back to you again.
Let us move ahead with the sustainability of Mann Ki Baat.
When the emergency situation was implemented in the country, the movement against it was not confined to the political circles, political leaders and prisoners.
I don't feel hungry when we eat diva and dinner in time.
Likewise, in everyday life, the importance of the rights of the Republic is felt only when that right is hiding.
And this is not because the Indian Constitution has taken some steps to increase democracy.
There is a need for constitution and law to ensure that the society is smoothly run.
And that's why the country dedicated to a total election, not for itself, to protect democracy.
Recently, the greatest election process of democracy, the biggest election process has been completed in our country, where the richest to the poor, everyone is willing to decide the future of the country by joining this campaign.
When anything is very close to us, we cannot achieve its importance
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India
However, if we look at the whole world, I will tell you that more people have voted in India than the population of any country in the world without a sugar.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than double the total population of the United States.
The total number of electors in India is higher than the population of the entire Europe.
These are the indicators of our democracy's vastness and widespreadness.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election is yet to be the worlds largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine how massive organisations and human resources are required to complete this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and staff.
On one hand, about three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have performed their responsibilities, while 20 lakh police personnel in different states have worked untiringly to achieve this great sacrifice of democracy.
As a result of their hard work, this time more voting has been done than the last election.
In this election process, about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines and more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are being arranged.
To ensure that no one is deprived of his ballot experiment.
Polling stations have been set up for only one female electorate in a remote place in Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officials of the Election Commission have to travel for two days to reach that place.
This is the real honor of democracy.
The highest number of polling stations in the world is also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahul-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another information that we can be proud of.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have also voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of male and female electors in this election is almost equal.
One more inspiring fact is that now there are 78 women Parliamentarians in Parliament, which are a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and all those associated with the voting process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you will have heard many times in my mouth: Not Bouquet, Book.
I wish I'd like to write a book instead of the flowers to adopt the welcomes
Another story that shakes my heart deeply is Idgah.
The story is a boy's condolence, a pure love for his sister.
When Hamid takes a pinch from the fair to his grandmother, he really feels like the love of human mind, the compassion and compassion can be incomplete.
The last line of this story is in our thoughts, an unprecedented truth of life in learning, "Shishu Hamid played the role of the elderly Hamid: Old INA, Girl INA.
Like a very heartening story is Pus Ki Night.
This story shows the irony of the life of a poor farmer.
The farmers are very happy even after their crops are destroyed, because they do not have to sleep in the fields in the winter season.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, yet its relevance is still the same.
After reading the story, I feel another kind of feeling.
When the book is about to read, in a media, I read about Kerala's letters library.
You will be surprised to know that the library is in the middle of a village in the dense forest of Idukki.
A Primary School teacher P.
V. Chinnathampi worked extraordinaryly for this library.
There was a time when the book was brought to the back by putting it on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to the tribal children and everyone.
Gujarat's 'Wanche Gujarat' campaign is a successful initiative.
Millions of people of all ages have participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and give some place to your daily routine.
You will really enjoy a lot of enjoyment and write on the NarendraModiApp about whatever book you read, so that all the listeners of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things that are not just present but a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the NarendraModiApp and MyGov and I saw that many people had written a lot about water problems.
Belgavir Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
Water has a huge impact on our culture.
Rik Veda's Ap: Suktam's water is said to have said that Apo Hishtha Mao Bhub: Urja Ne Urja Dadhatan, Maha Ranay Chakshse Yo Bah: Shivatamo Ras: Tasya Bhajayteh Nah Ushtiriv Matar:
Several parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year, only 8 per cent of the water received from rains are conserved in our country.
Only 8 percent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that like other problems, we will find solutions to this crisis through public participation, through the power of the people, through the capability, cooperation and resolution of 130 crore people.
Keeping in mind the importance of water, new Jal Shakti Ministry has been created in the country.
It will enable all matters related to water to be taken into consideration.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate differently.
I had written letters to all the villagers of the country.
I had written to the villagers to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to meet the Gram Sabha and to consult the villagers.
I am glad that they have shown full zeal and on 22nd of A-Mass, thousands of thousands of Panchayats have donated labour.
People in the villages have committed to harvesting one drop of water.
Today, at the Mann Ki Baat, I would like to listen to a village panchayat.
The Chief of the Panchayat of Lupung village of Katkamashandi block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, listen to the message that my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote our letter to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letters.
The people of the country are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
On behalf of me, my best wishes to all the heads of the village, to all the heads of the Panchayat for their activeness.
There are many such Panchayat heads across the country who have been involved in water conservation.
What I said, it is possible for everyone to get a positive outcome.
But everyone's goal is the same, save water, water conservation.
The work of revival of water drain in Punjab is underway.
This is helping in relieving the problem of water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir in Thimaipalli, Telangana is transforming the lives of the people of the village.
The construction of small ponds in the fields of poet Dham of Rajasthan has brought about a major change.
I was talking about a public effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women were in one place to save Nagadi.
I was also studying about the women of Garhwal who are working together to keep the rain water holding.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat, I urge the people of the country to make three requests.
My first request: Just as the people of the country made cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
We all pledge to save every drop of water. I believe that water from God is a prasad, water is a form of stone.
I launch a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Whether it is the world of cinema, the world of sports, the friends of the media, the people associated with the social organisations, the people associated with the cultural organisations, the artists of dialogue, everybody should lead this movement through their own methods.
Awaken the society, connect everyone and tied it.
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us create a list of water conservation methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You all can share your content using Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I express my gratitude to you and all the people of the world for one more thing.
The way on June 21, once again in Yoga Day, three or four generations of one family full of enthusiasm have celebrated Yoga Day together.
The awareness about the Holistic Health Care has increased the significance of Yoga Day.
If a Yoga lover welcomes the sun with sunrise in every corner of the world, his entire journey ends with sunset.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, distinguished dignitaries and common man from all over the world have shown me on a tour how they celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
On that day, the world looked like a large family full of happiness.
We all know that the need for a healthy society, a healthy and sensitive human being is that of Yoga.
Therefore, Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, the Prime Minister's Awards had been announced for a unique contribution to the promotion and improvement of Yoga, which is of course greetings to me.
The awards have been given to those organizations in the world who have played a crucial role in the promotion and promotion of Yoga.
Just like Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs many institutions and training courses.
And wherever the matter is associated with yoga, can Indians be lagging behind
The Yoga Vidyalaya of Munger, Bihar, who has been dedicated to Yoga for the past decades, has been honored.
Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University have also been awarded to Swami Rajarshi Munick.
The admirable celebrations of Yoga and honouring the messages of Yoga in the households have been added to Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started awaiting new ideas, new feelings, new resolutions and new energy.
You can connect yourself with your feelings, it is important for me that Mann Ki Baat is just a long time.
Let your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together to listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the next month, the Mann Ki Baat will meet you again.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, I have a lot of hearts in the beginning of Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost his brave sons.
To tackle the challenges faced by the country, we all have to forget racism, communalism, regionalism and all others, so that we can take stronger, stronger and fruitful steps than before against terrorism.
Our armed forces are indicative of indomitable courage.
You have seen what steps have been taken within 100 hours of terrorism.
The soldiers have taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their terrorists.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational message of their families came out through the media, which awakens the immense courage, zeal and energy among the people of the country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of martyr Ratan Tagore in Bhagalpur, Bihar, inspires all of us in this sad moment.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight against the enemies of the country and will be present on the grounds of fighting if necessary.
The entire nation wishes the indomitable courage of martyr Prasanna Sahur's wife Meenaji in Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
He took the pledge to join his only son in the CRPF.
When Shahid Vijay Soren's dead body covered with national flag reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son says he will also join the army.
With the zeal of this innocent child, this determination and feeling today reflects the feelings of young children of India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that we all were waiting for for so long for independence is going to end.
It is natural for the countrymen to have many questions and disciplines in this regard.
The Prime Minister expressed happiness over the creation of Shri Omkar Shettyji National Ware Memorial at the Narendra Modi App, Karnataka.
I was amazed and distressed that there was no National Ware Memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, our country's former Prime Minister Morarjibhai Desha was born on 29 February.
You all know that this special day comes once in 4 years.
In a simple and peaceful personality, Baliyan, Morarjibhai was one of the most loyal leaders of this country.
In this independent India, the record of presenting the budget for the first time in Parliament is Morarji Bhai Deshai.
During that difficult time, Morarji Desai gave the right leadership to India when democracy of the country was in a terrible situation.
Morarjibhai Desai had dedicated himself to protect this democracy in the fight against the Emergency.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of price even when he came to Bardhakya.
The government of that day arrested him and sent him to jail.
But when Janta Party won the poll in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
The 44th Constitution was proposed to be amended during his Prime Ministership.
The incident is very important because the 42nd Amendment was proposed for the Emergency, where there were other proposals to embarrass the power of the Supreme Court, so that our democratic values were also proud, which were not implemented and sent back.
As a result of the 44th Amendment Proposal, all the functions of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies have been published in the newspaper.
Besides, some of the powers of the Supreme Court are preserved, the amendment proposes that clauses 20 and 21 of the Constitution should not be abolished due to essential conditions of citizens.
Once again, I pay homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the people with the Padma Awards.
I want to tell you some of these people today.
Ghafur Khatdi ji, a singer of Gujarat, has done a surprising job to revive Kutch's rogan art.
He has done a wonderful job to bring this rare industry to new generations.
I gifted Tree of Life to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the Padma awardees, Sabbir Said of Marathwada is known as Gomatar Sevak.
The way he delivered his entire life to the service of Goddess Gomata, he is unique.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who has tried to strengthen and self-sufficient the oppressed and exploited through the Kalanjium Movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has trained all the people around the world at the age of 100 and has made 1500 Yoga teachers so far.
He has not only saved 50 hectares of jungles from erosion, but also sent ten thousand women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamunaji, today the people of the village planted 18 trees at the time of birth of every child and 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl.
He himself has worked for the development of Divyang women and has dedicated himself to the virtue of making blind children self-reliant by creating an institution called 'Chhukhu Mahila Sevakunj'.
My dear countrymen, this is the first time that the Padma awards have been given to 12 farmers in this year.
Ordinarily, very few people belonging to the agriculture sector and those who are directly present in the list of Padma Shri beneficiaries.
And this is the vibrant picture of changing India.
My dear countrymen, today I will tell you all about a heart-breaking feeling that I have achieved myself for the past few days.
Today, I would like to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM-JYA and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme.
I understand how big changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
If you know any poor person who is not able to get treatment without money, then you will tell them about this scheme.
This scheme has been implemented for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters are going to start school examinations.
Academics across the country will start preparations for the examination of the Class II and Class II.
My best wishes to the examinees, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, there was a massive event in the Town Hall Format in Delhi on the occasion of Pariksha Pe Charcha.
I extend my best wishes to all the students, their teachers, their parents, UTUs, to the upcoming exam warriors and all those involved.
My dear countrymen, India will be talking about and it will not happen to be worshipped.
Perhaps there is no Hen Day in our country when there is no festival or festival connected with us because we have thousands of years old heritage.
And in a few days, the Mahashivaratri has come and Shivratri has fallen on Monday and Shivratri, our hearts are filled with special pious feelings and devotion.
I am very impressed with the power of the persons with disabilities.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I face crores of families every month through radio.
Many times I feel like reading your letters, talking to you or listening to your phone calls, suggestions and suggestions that you have made me one of your families.
It's a very happy feeling.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festivals of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with the election.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He has given life to the people's favour, shelter, education and spirituality.
Siddhganga Math is the organiser of the Animal Husbandry Mela.
I bow to such a great man once again.
But today I want to talk about this.
Imagine, just for a voter.
If somebody's unable to ballot, then he's supposed to suffer.
I urge all the dignitaries of the country to take up the campaign in Amras BIMI to enroll the voter television and vote on the day of election.
I am confident that a large number of young and young voters will be listed and strengthen our democracy in the share of the voters.
It is here that the British rulers were present on the occasion of Veer Santaan Karnel Prem Sehgal, Col Guru Box Singh and General Shah Waz Khan.
When I was watching Netaji's related stories in the Red Fort Temple, the members of Netaji's family presented me a special gift.
He used to use this thing.
I have arranged in the museum so that the common man looks at these things and inspires the patriots to watch the seminar.
The valour of our heroes, the stories of our patriotism are very good for our generations.
On 30th December, I visited Andaman and Nicobardeep Puja in this month.
But that was the 75-year-old air incident of the Azad Hind Government.
He said, "Delhichlo", "Your Lord, I am your freedom god", has made this kind of folk song by Netaji, the people of India.
There was a lot of years of age that all the files related to Netaji would be public.

The Para-Asian edition has also improved the results of India.
However, if I talk about the success of every Indian and our holistic endeavour, the Mann Ki Baat will become so long that by 2019 it will start.
All this has been possible in the indomitable efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we lost some excellent countrymen.
Dr. Jayachandran died on 19th December in Chennai.
Narsamma was a helper in the delivery of pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
Earlier this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri.
There are many exemplary personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have lived their lives for the welfare of the society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some of my party members inform me that some young doctors in the city are taking care of the poor free of cost.
Now every month hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp.
The zeal of these doctors and friends who are engaged in selfless service is really commendable.
Today, I can say with pride that with our collective efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than three lakh people are associated with Swachhta Abhiyan.
City Corporation, voluntary organisations, school and college students and the people of Jabalpur participated with enthusiasm in this mega sanitation yagya.
Here I know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever there is time, I try to know about this kind of inspiring thing by visiting the Beater India Dot Comme website.
I am glad that today there are several such websites that introduce us to the life story of inspirational people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati dot in.
I believe that many people will be able to know about these heroes to bring about change in society.
Negativeness is very easy to spread, but there is a lot of good work in our society around us and this is possible in the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Every society has a different significance of sports.
Whenever a game takes place, the audience also gets a communication.
I would like to talk about Hanya Nissar, a girl from Kashmir, who won a gold medal at Caret in Korea.
The twelfth year of Hanya stays in Anantnag in Kashmir.
On behalf of all the people, I wish him a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Rail for Hanaya.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussion in the media about another daughter and sixteen Rajni.
You must have read it.
The Rajni girls won the gold medal in the Golden Boxing 1972.
He did this in honor of his father Jasmer Singh, who sold Lassi at a waterway shop.
Rajini told him that he had to accept a lot of sacrifices and sufferings to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh went out every morning before Rajni and his brothers and sisters got up.
When Rajini expressed his desire to learn boxing to his father, he tried his best to enhance his zeal and to achieve his dream.
Rajni Boxing practices start with old glasses, because the financial condition of her family was not good.
Despite all the adversities, Rajni did not lose courage and continued to learn boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia too.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni and congratulate his parents, Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani for being with Rajni and encouraging him.
This month, the 20-year-old Bedangi Kulkarni bicycle of Pune has achieved the pride of being the fastest Asian.
He ran about 300 kilometers of cycles per day for 159 days.
You imagine, 300 kilometers cycling every day
His indomitable spirit of cycling is really commendable.
The adversity never hinders.
When we heard of other such examples, we also inspire every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, in January, many festivals are being celebrated with enthusiasm and joy, such as Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi etc.
All these festivals will be seen somewhere in the entire India, the color of traditional dance, somewhere in the joy of cultivation of crops will be burnt in Lohri, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the Jamjamat fair.
Somewhere the sports will be organised, somewhere they will run, somewhere they will feed each other with sweetness.
All these festivals are different, but the purpose of the festival is to celebrate these festivals is somewhat related to agriculture and livestock.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun enters the Makar Rashi.
Since then, the day begins to grow gradually and the winter season starts.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is enshrined in the glorious festival of this spirit.
We can see how closely these festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not distinguished, people and groups are united.
Another beautiful example of our intimacy with nature is the festival-based calendar.
These calendars also contain details of planet constellation with festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and psychological events.
Based on the pace of the moon and the sun, the date of festivals and festivals is determined according to the moon-source calendar.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
Festivals are scheduled to be held at many places on planets and planets.
The festivals like Gudi-Padwa, Cheti-Chand, Ugadi are celebrated according to the moon calendar, similarly Tamil Puthandu and Vishu, Vaishakh, Vaishakhi, Paula Vaishakh, Bihu etc. are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Many of us have a special objective of protecting rivers and water in the mountains.
Chhota Parvati is connected to rivers and reservoirs of sun worship.
Millions of people bath in sacred rivers in Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, on the other hand, these festivals inspire and inspire each other to have brotherhood with each other.
I extend my best wishes and best wishes to all of you in 2019 and enjoy all these festivals.
Share the photographs of this festival with all of you so that the beauty of India's diversity and Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture that we can be proud of and can showcase the entire world by raising its heads.
You must have heard a lot about Kumbh.
In many films, this fair has been depicted with the heritage and vastness and it is true that the Kumbh form is as rich as it is.
People from all over the country and the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
This Kumbh Mela is spread over the masses of faith and devotion.
Millions of people from abroad are meeting together.
The tradition of Kumbh is enriched and enriched by our great cultural heritage.
Saint-Mahatmara has started reaching Kumbh from now on.
Last year, UNESCO has registered the Kumbh Mela in the list of Integral Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, Ambassadors of many countries have seen preparations for Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of many countries together.
There is a possibility of more than one and a half hundred people coming to Prayagraj in Kumbh Mela.
This can be a very big learning expertise for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago, I saw the strong preparations for the Kumbh.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
This time there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in the Kumbh.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of human faith, was closed for thousands of years, and the pilgrims could not see it even if they wanted.
Now the door of Akshay Boat has been opened for everyone.
My request to you is that when you go to Kumbh, you must share different features of Kumbh and pictures on social media so that a large number of people are inspired to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integration.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, the celebrations of the Republic Day, the people of the country are very enthusiastic and on that day we remember those great personalities who have gifted our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Shri Siril Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable bond.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became a Mahatma.
Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha in South Africa and stood up against separatism.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy farms from where there was a voice for peace and justice all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to spend all those years in prison from revered Bapu.
Mandela said, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he used himself on the path of truth.
There are detailed discussions on how steps are required to strengthen the security of the country and the people.
In this conference, I have announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration, which will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in some way.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He has worked for Indias integrity.
He said that the unity of the country remains in diversity.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this Ekta Puraskar to showcase this spirit of unity.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
Most of his life was his workplace in North India and he sacrificed his last breath in Nanded, Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna, the workplace of North India and the last time of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has blessed him.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, it is the biggest service to remove the sufferings of the people.
This great man was full of bravery, valour, sacrifice and religion.
His extraordinary knowledge was in weapons and scriptures.
On the one hand, he was a pilgrimage, on the other hand, Gurumukhi, Braj language, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi, English etc.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good events in the country which do not have wide discussions.
Various events are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Efforts to make safe and healthy food habits.
Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organized across the country as part of Eat Right in India campaign.
The campaign will continue till 27th January.
India will be prosperous only when India becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritional diet is first essential for good health.
Whether it is a personal life or a national life or a social life, it is a source of inspiration for progress.
Let us move ahead with innovative inspiration, innovative inspiration, innovative resolve, innovative goals, new heights, change yourself and change the country.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
The 50th edition of this journey of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
It's said Golden Jubilee Episode Golden Episode.
The 50th edition of the letters and phones that have come here today has been mentioned.
With the help of My Gauv App, Bhasukumar, Kamalkumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav, Manika Jain of Delhi, Government of West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur, have sent almost one question.
This question is very normal.
In today's era, when people had almost forgotten the radio, why did Modi return the radio
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to the radio.
Listen to the radio, there's a discussion about the bomb torn.
The shop said that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said on the radio that the historical significance of the bomb exploration and nuclear bomb exploration was that day.
On seeing the joy of the shopkeepers, the dancing, I thought that the people were listening to the radio in this area, the hilly areas surrounded by snow and the jungles.
I'm thinking of the radio communication search and its far-reaching effects.
After that, when I became the Prime Minister, it is natural that I will take the help of the most powerful connectivity.
I remember that since May 2014, when I began to take over the responsibility of the Chief Servant, I felt that Indias unity, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, mankind's work, emotions, sacrifices and penance must spread this story to all the people of the country.
Every month I reached the 50th episode to read lakhs of letters, listen to the phone calls, know about the various apps coming together and tell myself slightly fun.
The results of the survey are very encouraging.
Seventy percent of the listeners are listening to the Mann Ki Baat, they have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most people think Mann Ki Baat has enhanced positive thinking among all sections of the society.
The mass movement through Mann Ki Baat has achieved a lot of detail.
Has Tag India Positive has been discussed on this subject.
This is a smooth transformation in which people are moving forward for the service of the society.
Modi will come and go but our country will remain immortal and our culture will remain immortal.
These small stories of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
Full of enthusiasm, new inspiration will bring the country to a higher height.
I read letters and feel like this in them and keep in mind.
I have achieved both myself and shared with them and shared with you all.
But who knows when these things will reach home again.
Sometimes there will be such a power of the government that the schemes like Self with Daughter, that is, Nazi with Nazi's daughter will start from a small village in Haryana, not only in the entire country but also in the world.
The people of every section of the society and the celebrities have also been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been depicted in such a modern narrative that will illuminate the modern generation.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat has also been enjoyed, but in my mind, 130 crore people are always sitting.
Their mind is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government thing, it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life in which politics is only one aspect.
If politics becomes the basic subject, it cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that the other talent of the society or other entrepreneurship becomes neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to keep in mind the talent of human beings and other matters of society for the bright future of a country like India and a small and brilliant endeavour to move forward towards Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that the biggest achievement of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not the Prime Minister, you are questioning one of your closest friends, this is democracy.
There's also a toll free number - 1  7800, calling there, men record their message in their throats.
I try to read the letters and comments as much as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I heard a lot of phone calls.
This time, the Mann Ki Baat episode is coming forward, I have a very heartfelt opinion and thoughts that you have been sent to different places while traveling.
That letter isn't just a piece of paper for me.
Besides this, I have spent about 40-45 years of life in one family and have gone to most of the districts of the country and have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place and time.
After that, I note some information such as the name of the village, the name of the person.
In fact, in the Mann Ki Baat, I am the only one but for example, the emotion and life force of my countrymen, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name Mann Ki Baat till date, but they keep sending their letters and words without desperation.
I have full faith that your message will come to me more than before and make Mann Ki Baat more psychological, effective and useful.
It is also tried that all the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be monitored by the concerned departments regarding letters and suggestions.
I would like to thank all the media, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media friends of ASHAN.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the maximum number of people with their hard work.
Thus, they became Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I would like to congratulate them for their talent and skills.
I urge all of you to listen to this event in your regional language too.
I thank all those friends of the media who are propagating Mann Ki Baat on their channels regularly.
No political person is suffering from the media, he thinks he is very less covered or negative coverage, but many subjects published in the Mann Ki Baat programme have taken up the media.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Nidhi ji, thank you for your phone call.
Normally I say I have no secret.
What I'm doing is perhaps in every family.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like those youngsters, to keep myself in that situation and make a wave length match with their opinions.
We have some old baggages in our lives, if they are not brought forward then it will be easy to explain to anyone.
I don't understand any of the two, how a man has ever accepted his own thinking and has done his own.
Todays youngsters have a good quality, they don't believe what they themselves do, and when they believe in something, they leave everything behind it.
People often talk about communication gaps between the elders and the teenagers of the family.
However, in most of the families, there are limited discussions with the teenagers.
Most often talk about reading or habits, lifestyle. Do this, don't do it.
It is also a matter of concern that the interaction is gradually decreasing in the family without any condition.
Acknowledgements in exchange for expectations and without deliberate discussions, any media is important.
I have been interacting with the youth through various programmes and social media.
I have always learned from the thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Youngsters are entrepreneurs, innovations and innovations.
Some people say that young students want to work together.
I mean, what's bad about it
They are transparent in multi-tasking, so they do this.
If we look around, we will see social initiatives, start-ups, sports and other sectors, there is a big change in the society.
Those youngsters who have the courage to question and dream.
If we leave the ability to decide on the youth and if they openly express their thoughts, then they can bring about creative changes in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, on the website of Mai Gauv from Gurugram, Vinita ji wrote that we should talk about the Constitution Day on 26th November, this time in Mann Ki Baat.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of Indias Constitution.
Thank you very much for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow 'Constitution Day'.
Let us remember those great personalities who have created our Constitution.
Our Constitution was passed on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years and 11 months and 17 days of the Constituent Assembly to complete this historical work of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine that within three years, these great talented persons have given us such a broad and comprehensive constitution.
The extraordinary pace that they have created the Constitution is a unique example of time management and productivity in todays days.
Inspired by this, we are also inspired to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a convention of the great talented people of the country, which was committed to providing a Constitution to the country so that the people of India empowered and the poorest of the poor could be empowered.
The main feature of our Constitution is that the rights and duties i.e. Rights and Duties are detailed here.
The balance of these two things in the lives of the citizens of the country will take the country forward.
If we respect each other's rights, then you will also protect your rights, and if we obey our duty in the Constitution then our rights will also be fulfilled.
I remember that in 2010, in 60 years of India's democracy, in Gujarat, we had taken a pilgrimage by placing the Constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable endeavour to make the youth aware of the Constitution and make them interested in the various sections of the Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we are going to complete 70 years and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all recognise the value of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity, peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
His Mahaparinirvana Divas on 6th December.
On behalf of all the people of the country, I salute Babasaheb who has given crores of Indians the right to save dignity.
The Republic was under the thinking of Babasaheb and he used to say that Indias democratic ideals are not external.
The republic or parliamentary system was not new to India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had prayed for an emotional impression that we have achieved this independence after several battles and that is why we have to protect it from the last point of blood.
He added that the Indians should always be prioritized to the welfare of the country, however, in different environments.
Once again I pay homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev and will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv next year in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev has always wished for the welfare of humanity.
He has always guided the society to the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony.
Our country will celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev next year, which will spread across the world by printing its expansion.
All States and Union Territories have been requested to observe this day with great fanfare.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
A train will also be run at all the sacred places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently, when I was discussing this thing, I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, this Gurudwara was severely damaged, but the way the state government revived the Gurudwara along with the local people, it is an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that travellers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev at Kartarpur in Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th edition, we will meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and I believe that for the first time I had the idea of Mann Ki Baat, I could bring it to you because you people wanted to know about it.
Our journey will continue.
As much as I can get your courage, this journey will be deeper and satisfactory.
Sometimes the question arises in the minds of the people, what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart. Most people say that when they listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme in the family, they feel that the family members are sharing their own words with them.
When I came to know about this thing in detail that I am amongst you, among you and you all made me big, I am very happy that I will come again and again through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your good wishes, I'm good.
Come, let's take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I wish you all must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
Around six and a half months before independence, a picture of Sardar Patel was published on the 27th January, 1997 of the famous international newspaper Time.
India's design in its lead storey of Time Service.
There were more than 550 national states then.
Though the interest of the British in India was finished, they wanted to keep this country divided.
It was written in the Time that India had the risks like diversity, violence, food crisis, value addition and power politics, but if anyone had the power to bind the country in the form of unity, then he was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji had told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so terrible that you can solve it only.
Sardar Patel really found ways for solutions to one-on-one problems and showed the impossible task of unity in the entire country.
Be it Junagadh or Hyderabad, Tribankur or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person who has been able to see the unified India in the strategy of intellectual thinking and strategy.
When we look at this nation and our mother India binding in unity, we remind us of the auspicious memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel because on this day, we will give the Statue of Unity to the nation as a tribute to him.
Established on the banks of the Narmada River in Gujarat, the statue is doubled by the Statue of Liberty in America.
This will be the world's highest skyscraping architecture.
Every Indian can now proudly say that the highest statue of the world is now in India.
I believe that this specific architecture will be identified as a favourite vision across the country.
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from the inventors.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great soldiers of India, Sam Manekesh.
In this meeting, Field Marshal Manekesh spoke of the time when he was Colonel.
At that time, the army campaign started in Kashmir in 1997.
Field Marshal Manekesh said, "How was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel interrupted in a meeting that was delayed in sending troops to Kashmir at that time, Sardar Patel looked at his habit and said that there will be no delay in the military operation in Kashmir and the solution to the problem as soon as possible.
On 31st October, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, passed away.
I pay homage to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who do not like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc.
The measurement of the success of any sportsperson is all these qualities.
On the other hand, these four times are important for nation building.
With all these qualities in the youth of any country, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country, but will also flag off the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I have two meetings, which are to be remembered.
First, I got the opportunity to meet Para Athletes participating in the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
India has made a new record and enhanced the dignity of 72 medals in the Games.
We have won three more medals in addition to 13 medals in Mix Event.
You must remember that this time the Asian Federation of India was also very good.
Look, in the last few minutes, I have used the best, the most beautiful words so far.
At the age of eight, he has a father-in-law.
He spent eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he was cleaning the DTC bus and washing on the edge of the road.
This Narayan has won the gold medal for India in the International Event today.
Not only this, the sports sector in India is getting an extension that the events like Judo, where India has not won any Olympic medal at the Cinear Level till date, Tawabi Devi has created a new history in Judo in Youth Olympics.
Sixteenth year old woman Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
His father sells a daily jute and mother fish.
Many times there is a situation that they don't even have the meaning of buying food.
Such a situation has also enjoyed the zeal of Tawabi Devi.
He has created history in winning medals for the country.
There are many more such narratives, the source of inspiration for each one of them.
Every young sportsperson, their zeal is the identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember that we have successfully organized the FI FA UNDER 17 World CUP in 2017.
It has also been appreciated among the worlds most successful editions.
FIFA UNDER 17 World CUPARCED breaks the number of audiences.
More than 12 lakh visitors have seen footballs in various stadiums of the country and have encouraged young sportspersons.
This time, India has achieved the privilege of the World Cup Hockey Organization in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup will continue from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves the game has a different place in their minds.
India has a golden history in the hockey game.
In the past, India has won gold several times, once it has won.
India has gifted some world-class players in the hockey sports world.
If there is a discussion on hockey at any place in the world, then it will be incomplete.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is a recognition worldwide.
Besides, Dhanraj Pillai Hockey from Balwinder Singh Sinior, Leslie Cladius, Mohammad Saheed, Udham Singh has glittered India's name in the world.
Even today, the Hockey sportspersons of Team India are making examples of success for new generations in labour and dedication.
It's a wonderful experience for sports lovers to sit in the stadium.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, the Indian team will not only encourage all the countries.
The heritage of prosperity and cultural excellence has to be reminded and reminded by the people of Odisha.
Orissa is also a beautiful opportunity for sports lovers.
My best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are moving forward in the work of social service, they are volunteering and it is becoming a big inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has also committed to learning Wheelchair Basketball for playing basketballs in Wheelchair.
This mentality, this self-confidence is the mission mode activity.
There are no Indians who will not be proud to hear these things.
This idea will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, This time when I was seeing your suggestions about Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a thrilling statement from Mr. Manesh Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov: Please speak in the Mann Ki Baat of this time how Indian tribes and their customs become the best example of unity with nature.
For the sustainable development, we will reaffirm their heritage, we need to learn something from them.
Manish Ji, I express my gratitude to you for keeping such a thing in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that I inspire to see our glorious past and culture back and today the world, especially the western countries, are discussing environmental conservation and looking for a new way for a balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far away from this problem, but we have to self-determinate to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The people of Madhya Pradesh, especially Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, worship the trees like Vat, Arjun with respect.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way to conserve the environment.
They are ready to sacrifice their lives for the protection of trees, but they are not ready to accept the loss of a tree.
The mishmis of Arunachal has a relationship with the tiger.
They mean they call him their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the tiger is seen as a protector of the forest.
The people of the Worli community of Maharashtra regard the tiger as guests and the lions are a symbol of prosperity for them.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that they are associated with their fortunate lions and if the tiger does not get food then the villagers will also have to be discredited.
The Gond Tribal Breeding Season of Central India stops fishing at some places of the Kyen River.
They call these places as a refugee place for fish, and they carry fresh fish in large quantities.
Tribal communities make their homes from natural materials, which are strong and environment friendly.
In South India, there is a small traveling community in the remote areas of the Nilgiri Mountain, which has been built by the local level, according to traditions.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is true that the tribal community believes in very peaceful and combining themselves, but whenever anyone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, tribal people were also there.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against the British rule to protect his forests
There are many such examples of the tribal community who can save us with nature, and for the survival of the forests around us, our country is gratitude to tribal communities.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, during the Mann Ki Baat programme, we talk about those people and their problems that are doing something exemplary for the society.
The work that looks simple, but in reality it has a far-reaching effect on changing our mindset and determining the goals of society.
A few days ago, I was studying about Gurubachan Singh ji of Punjab.
Gurubachan Singh ji's son was married to a common and labouring farmer.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh ji had told his parents that they would do this marriage in anonymity.
He suddenly said he has a condition.
Nowadays, if you say conditions in marriage, it usually seems he's going to talk about a big pun... you want something that will make Kan's family difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white farmer, he told Kaner Baba that the condition he was talking about is the real power of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, Let me tell you that from now on, you will not harvest the remains after harvesting the crops in the farm land.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden in it.
Gurubachan Singh ji feels extraordinary, but it is his personality, and we have seen that there are many families in our society who have transformed the individuals into the best of the society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh ji has set an example.
I read about another village in Punjab, Kallar Majra, which is near the naval.
Kallar Majra was in the forefront because the people there did not burn the rice cottage and mix it with the soil, so that the technologies needed were prepared by themselves.
My best wishes to brother Gurubachan Singh Ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who are making their best efforts to make the environment polluted.
You all are taking the healthy lifestyle that is available in the form of Indian heritage.
Like the drops of water produce the sea, such small awareness and positive works are always helpful in creating a positive environment.
For India this year, the day of 11th November has a special significance because the first war ended on 11th November, a hundred years ago.
That is, it will be a hundred years after the end of that terrible destruction and democracy.
First World War for India is an important event.
True, we had no connection with this great war.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country have fought with the bravery of this war, have played a very big role and made the highest sacrifice.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind the battlefield.
Our soldiers have demonstrated their valour in difficult areas.
The only purpose of this was the restoration of peace.
In the first war, the whole world saw the ruins of destruction.
It is estimated that about one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world understands the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a special feature in the North-East of India.
Besides the natural beauty of this place, the people here are very talented.
Our Northeast is now known for the best and important work.
This is a place where organic farming has improved a lot.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Honble Future Policy Gold Award for encouraging sustainable food system.
The award was conferred on behalf of FAO Economic Food and Agricultural Organisation, a UN organisation.
You will be happy to know that the awards given for formulating the best policy in this specific field are like Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim won this award by losing one hundred and twenty-five countries.
I thank the people of Sikkim for this.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is going to end.
Climate change is understanding.
Winter has come and the season of festivals has come along with climate change. Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhaifonta, Chhat Puja, the month of November is also the month of festivals.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen for all festivals.
I request you to take care of yourself during the festival, pay attention to your health and pay attention to the good of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the progress of the country.
The more you move, the more the country moves.
