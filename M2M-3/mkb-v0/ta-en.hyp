Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that any Indian community participates in it.
Now many governments and citizens and social movements of the country are celebrating Deepawali with full zeal and enthusiasm.
In a way, it can also be said that India is being built there.
Friends, Festival tourism in the world becomes an attraction.
There are immense potential for festival tourism.
Whatever our efforts are to be, we should enjoy Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Phihu and all the festivals
Various festivals are held in every state and in every region in our country, in which the people of other countries participate in a large number of countries.
Therefore, the participation of Indians living abroad is very important in expanding the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we have decided in the voice of the last Mann Ki Baat that we will do something different on this Deepavali.
We all had also said that on this Deepavali, we will celebrate India's women's power and its achievements, that is, we will pay homage to the daughters of India or not
In a few days, many stories of inspiring in the social media have started to focus.
In the App called Namo Af, Kodhibagh Ramesh ji from Varangalai, he described his mother as his power.
In the year of 1990, during my father's time, my mother accepted the gold of five children.
Today we have five brothers sitting in good work.
Ramesh ji, my greetings to your mother.
Next, Geetika Swami Ji, who is very eager in the tweet, has said that Major Khushboo Governor is the daughter-in-law of India.
As for Kavita Tiwari Ji, the daughter of India is her daughter, she gives her strength.
Mother is very proud of her daughter's painting.
He has also received good values in the legal entrance examination called CLAT.
People are sharing such a united information.
You must read, get inspiration and share something in your neighborhood like those who are present in it, on this occasion I salute all the saints of India.
We know that the foundation stone was laid by him in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, this year on 12th November, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spreading not only in India but also in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters live in many countries of the world, who are fully dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji's high goals.
I will never forget to visit Venkuwar and Gurudwaras in Tehran.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev has to share many things about him, but he needs a lot of parts of the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Nanakdev ji considered the service to be above all.
Guru Nanakdev ji thought that the service of selflessness was invaluable.
He made a strong voice against social evils like evil, and worked.
The message of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread all over the world.
He is one of those who traveled a lot during his time.
He went to several places, wherever he went, through his simplicity and service, he will make everyone's minds successful.
Guru Nanakdev ji had taken several important religious visits, which are called Udasi.
He took the messages of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from all directions to the people of all the places, from the sovereigns and saints.
It is believed that the renowned saint of Assam, Shankardev ji, also got inspiration from him.
He travelled to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Shri Guru Nanakdev ji had stayed in Gurubagh Gurudwara, a sacred place of Kashi.
He has also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanakdev ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Peethar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the water control there.
We all remember that a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is in Birth, which was dedicated to him.
During a period, Guru Nanak ji travelled to the north, Kashmir and its adjoining areas.
This led to a strong link between Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji went to Tibet and the people there accepted him as a guru.
He is also honoured in the country of Uzbekistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took place in the minds of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full devotion and followed it even today.
A few days ago, government ambassadors from around 85 countries visited Delhi to the state of Amritsar.
They visited the Golden Fort, all this happened on the occasion of the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
On this day, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, was born, and he was the supremacist who joined the country.
Sardar Patel had a magnificent ability to unite people with them, while there was a power to reconcile with those who had differences.
He's really capable of seeing Man of Detail, tiny.
Besides, he is efficient in institutional activities.
The art of making plans and designing strategies was handled by him.
When we read about Sardar Ji's work, we know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of delegates from all over the country came to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements for the conference were imposed on Sardar ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's water network.
He assured that no one should have water deficiency.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to get kadarf bags.
At the same time, there has been considerable increase in Khadar sales.
Our country will be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitution.
He was of great significance to determine fundamental rights, which has no place for any inequality on the basis of caste and religion.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of the country, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has succeeded in integrating the estates into golden rocks in a big history.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we just talk about his contribution to some specific areas in the integration of the country.
As soon as Sardar Patel received this message, he did not delay for a moment, and immediately took a serious step.
Under his command, the threshold was immediately released to fly, and the soil was thrown away in the evil desire of the enemy to capture the Lakshadweeps while watching.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked brothers and sisters to ensure all necessary assistance for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing a significant role in Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist place.
I am confident that you all will visit its beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the statue of Unity was dedicated to the nation and to the world to commemorate the memorial of Sardar Iya on 31st October 2018.
This is the world's largest statue.
It is a statue of two parts higher than the statue of the freedom goddess in the United States.
Every Indian is proud of being the world's tallest statue.
Every Indian's head stands proud.
I am extremely happy that in one year more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity.
So, every day 8500 people have visited the pride of the statue of unity.
It is obvious that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has expressed confidence and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres such as sapphire gardens, buffalo gardens, forest plantations, child nutrition parks, unity nursery, which have developed the economy of that region and new opportunities for employment for the people.
Friends, For all the states of the country, for the tourism sector, this unity statue can be a research subject.
We all are witnesses to how one place can become a world-famous tourist destination within one year.
There are people from our country and people from abroad.
Several such organisations are developing one after the other, transport, accommodation, guides and environment friendly organizations.
And I also ask you to take away your precious time, and go to see the statue of unity.
But at the same time, I reiterate my request that every Indian traveling with his family should visit at least 15 places in India and stay there in the night.
Friends, You must have known that we are celebrating the 31st of October in 2014 as the nation's unity day.
On this day, we convey the message that the price of unity, unity and security of our country should be saved.
On the 31st of October, a drive for unity is being organised every year.
In this, all sections of the society and every section of the society will get a place.
In this context, this drive is being carried out not only for the body but for the inner and friendly, for India's unity and India's new heights.
My heartfelt countrymen, Sardar Patel ji joined the country with the spirit of unity.
This mantra of unity is like an example in our lives, in a diverse country like India, we must continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very positive and awakening to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us, there will be many examples of those who are engaged in sustainable activity to promote mutual harmony.
However, in some cases, the efforts of the society, its contribution and memories are not dissolved very quickly.
Friends, I remember in September 2010 and the Allahabad High Court has given its verdict on the Ramajanmabhoomi affairs.
But after the verdict on Ramajanmabhoomi, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions and sages and sages gave a very regrettable and moderate view.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
Those days, those moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of the great strength of unity in the country.
Even Gods who enjoy the benefits, 125 crore Indians themselves.
But there is a comfortable experience and an interesting experience.
I heard why I didn't share with you, I share.
Just imagine... the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature is 50-60 degrees below the ground.
In the air, there is only some name in the air.
In such a opposite situation, living within such challenges is not slightly less than any mighty act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries but also conducting a clean Siachen mission.
I convey my best wishes to the people of the country for this wonderful duty of the Indian Army and I express my gratitude to them.
It is difficult to forget anything in the harsh winter there.
In such a situation, it is very important to analyze and organise waste huts.
There is such an environment here, it is a living place of rare species of animals like ice buffalo and rare species of animals like iPex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are not time to create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on the day of Deepawali, something new is being purchased and something is being brought from the market in every family.
I had once said that we should try to buy local goods.
If we get the necessary things in our village then what is the need to go to the regional level
What is the need to go to the district level if one thing is available at the regional level
The more we are trying to buy local goods, Gandhi will develop into a great opportunity of 150 himself.
I reiterate my request that we should buy something in the hands of our weavers, the clothes wearing our weavers and the swords manufacturers.
Besides congratulating Deepawali, I appeal to you that we will become more people who want to buy local goods.
We must realise how important we can contribute to realizing the dreams of Gandhijis through this.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Deepawali triumph.
On the day of Deepawali we slaughter varieties of cattle.
However, sometimes it gets ruined due to our lack of attention.
It gets hurt.
Therefore, I ask you to protect you, and also to celebrate the festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and support for our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the victory of the valour of Parakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack that took place in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the secrecy of the war on our country.
Our soldiers have organized exhibitions at various places in the country to showcase the strength of the country's citizens, especially the youth.
See how talented we are, how our soldiers are saving their lives and saving our countrymen.
One day like Parakram Parv reminds the youngsters of the great tradition of our soldiers.
Moreover, it inspires us to ensure the unity and integration of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, a brave land.
Now it has been decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development environment of our country will give a strong answer to our soldiers.
India has always made its commitment to maintain peace and dedication.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers have sacrificed their greatest sacrifices for peace, even though we have no connection with those wars.
This is also a brave action understood by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Over the years, our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
In this context, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has attracted the attention of the people of the country by showing their strengths in the sky.
They have given us a security feeling.
On the occasion of the Independence Day celebrations, aerospace is one of the people's ambitions and aspirations of the march, in which our Air Forces will showcase their strengths with desperate actions.
On October 8, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1932, our Air Force, which started six flights with 19 Air Forces in a small scale, is now among the most adventurous and powerful Air Forces of the 21st century.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force personnel and their families who have served for the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistanis launched an unprecedented attack, our air force decided to save Sri Nagar from the attackers and landed the arms and war arms of Indian soldiers at the right time in the battlefield.
The Air Force responded strongly to the enemies in the year 1965.
Who will be those who are unaware of the 1971 Bangladesh freedom struggle
In the Tiger Hill area, all the enemies were hiding in the night, they drowned the bomb and smoked them with soil.
The country is grateful to the Air Force because of the remarkable actions of our Air Force personnel, whether it is rescue and relief work or disaster management.
Their feelings are amazing to tackle all the calamities ranging from storms, storms, floods and forest islands and help the people of the country.
Air Forces have shown an example in creating gender equality in the country and have opened their doors for women.
Now there is a change in women joining the Air Force with short-term work, and I have made this announcement from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
We can say that not only male power but also the contribution of women power to the Indian Army's military forces is increasing.
Women are empowered but now they are also armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, a naval officer was facing the struggle of Abilash Tomi and Jiva Sava.
The whole country was worried about how to save Tommy.
You know that Abilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian individual to travel through a small boat without any modern technology aid.
Over the past 80 days, he has been moving forward to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean without reducing his speed in the ocean.
He was a wonderful example of adventure, compassion and valour, a few days ago, when I had come out of the sea and brought aspiration out of the sea, I had a phone call with him.
I've already met Tommy.
I pray for the best health of Abilash Tomy, his courage, his compassion, his compassion, the power to fight, will certainly inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country knows what is important for our country on October 2.
There is another significance on 2nd October this year.
This year, we have organized several events across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhijis.
Gandhijis ideals have inspired the whole world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of respected brotherhood.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle was intensified, he prepared a collective copy of those thoughts.
He put forward his views on several issues such as dedicated rice, farmers, villages and workers' rights, safety, cleanliness and spread of education.
This is known as Gandhi Charter.
Everybody has experienced this in a very unique form of his personality.
He gave every person the feeling that everyone is very important for the country and it is imperative.
The transformation of this into a widespread mass struggle was his greatest contribution in the freedom struggle.
All the sections of the society, all the sections of the society, took up the challenges of Gandhiji in the freedom struggle.
And if she says, 'I give you a protective gift, whenever you are suspected, you have a feeling of 'Dhana' in you, take such a measure that whoever is poorer and weaker, look at that person, remember his face, listen to your mind, what kind of work you are doing, ask your mind how much benefit it will be for that person.
This will brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this preservation of the Gandhians is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something, can we remember the rice for an hour
Could you remember that coffin of Anna
Whose face will rejoice
Whoever you buy will have a direct or indirect effect
If this benefits the poorest of the poor, then my joy is multiplied.
Keep in mind the mantra of Gandhiji, when we all buy something in the days to come, when we buy everything, when we buy everything, when we buy it, especially those who have taught their sweat to make it, those who have invested their money, those who have sown their capabilities in it, all of them have to get some benefit in some way.
He might have been unaware of how this would happen, but this happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, today we can see how this small task of my country can contribute to the economic development and economic power contribution of the poor in fighting against their poverty.
But today, I believe that this is the true patriotism and this is the Karyaanjali that we can give to our mother.
He said that all these trails are tied with utmost difficulty and every work should be used.
And it came to pass, that there was sin in the land, and sin in the land, and in every nervous tract of the tabernacle of the tabernacle, which was a small image.
We celebrate two days after the birth anniversary of Shastri with a devoted brother.
His shout of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is the symbol of his narrowness.
As a result of his unhealthy commitment towards the country, in less than one and a half years, he was able to give a mantra of success to the soldiers and farmers of the country.
Millions of people have joined themselves in this campaign and I got the opportunity to serve with the children of Ambedkar School in Delhi in the cleanliness work.
The foundation stone for that school was laid by the Honble Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people across the country are engaged in this service on 15th.
Organisations have also contributed with great enthusiasm in this.
School children, college students, National Students Corps, Nation Welfare Programmes, youth organizations, media groups and corporates have served on a large scale.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those people who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Let's hear a phone call.
But if you didn't have to telephone to tell you how this was a gift after the toilets were made, the attention of the people associated with this movement would have gone without a smooth point of view.
I extend my gratitude to you in a special way.
My heart has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world, all of you are talking about it.
This time, India is organising the world's largest Swachhta Convention in an unprecedented history.
At the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and departmental experts from all over the world will share their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The closing ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Cleanliness Convention will be held on 2nd October this year at the commencement of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Water.
There are several provisions for the protection of the fundamental rights of the poor in the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Inspired by that vision, the National Human Rights Commission, NHRC was established on 12th October, 1993.
25 years will be completed in a few days after the commission is established.
The Commission is not only protecting human rights but also enhancing the dignity of human beings.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, the close leader of our hearts, said that we do not have a different principle of human rights.
The sign of our National Human Rights Commission has been engraved as 'Servey Pawandhu Sukina:' the policy that comes from the Vedic period.
The Commission has created a widespread awareness on human rights and has also contributed commendablely to prevent its misuse.
This 25-year visit has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
It provides a healthy society with confidence in the best democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also operating.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and follow it in practice and this is the basis for progress for all.
My dear countrymen, the birth centenary of Jaiprakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji is beginning in the month of October.
All these dignitaries have inspired us, let us remember them.
On the 31st of October, Sardar ji's birth anniversary will come and I will speak in a detail in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, but if I want to mention this thing in a detail about him then for a few years, on the 31st October of Sardar ji's birth anniversary, a unity festival is being organised in every small town and in every part of India and in every village.
This year, we have to make efforts to organise this drive for unity in our villages, circles, cities and cities.
The drive of unity is the best way to see Sardar ji better thinking about him because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society and every unity of the country through the drive of unity on 31st October, this will be a great tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the festival of Rakshabandhan is being celebrated throughout the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan's auspicious sister and brothers have been inspired by love and faith.
This festival is also a great example of social harmony for centuries.
Several special stories related to the faith of the people of two different regions or religions are also filled in the history of the country.
After a few days, Jenmashtami is coming.
Elephants, horses, toothbrushes - Jai Kanhaiyalal ki and Govinda-Govinda.
The enjoyment of Sri Krishna Bhakti is unparalleled.
In many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra, our youth will be preparing for Dahi-Handi.
My heartfelt greetings for Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami to all the people of the country.
My heartfelt gratitude to sister Sinmai for presenting a special thing.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, we are celebrating Sanskrit Day on the day of Chiravana Purnima.
I extend my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to bring this great treasure to the people of Merukuti and the common man.
Every language has a significance.
Everyone in India is proud of Tamil language as the world's oldest language
Likewise, from the Vedic period to today, we all are proud that Sanskrit language has played a very important role in spreading knowledge.
Gyan Kalanjiam, which is connected to every field of life, is portrayed in the Samaskrit language and its literature.
Whether it is science, technology, agriculture, well-being, air, architecture, architecture, management, economy or environment.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village in Shimoga district of Karnataka are still using Sanskrit as a case.
The possibilities of creating innumerable words of the Iran thousand words, 200 prefixes, 22 services, i.e. Sufix and society, are in the Samskrit
That's why any hot feeling or matter can be properly described.
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
We celebrate his birth anniversary as Teachers Day throughout the country.
I extend my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the auspicious occasion of Teachers Day.
At the same time, I extend my best wishes to the teachers for science, education and dedication to the students.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought aspirations to our hardworking farmers.
Natural has created more rainfall than other places.
We all saw how bad the lives of the people were affected by the severe floods in Kerala.
Even though we cannot fully compensate their grief, I believe that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of grief.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity recover quickly.
Everyone decides how to reduce the problems of the people of Kerala and how we share their sorrows.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of rescue operations in Kerala.
They have not left any attempt to save Sikhs in the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Army, Border Security Force, Central Industries Defence Force and Speed Force have contributed to this movement.
In particular, at this time, I would like to mention the hard work of the NDRF, the National Disaster Management Force.
Yesterday, the festival of Oman was celebrated and we all urge all of us to give strength to the country, especially to Kerala, to the impact of this disaster, to emerge faster and to make the journey of Kerala a faster development.
Once again, I assure all the people of the country, the people of Kerala and all those suffering from disasters all over the country that the entire country is close to you and is helpful in this difficult time.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions made for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen what the people of the country have written more about, it is our beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Kirti of Gaziabad, Swadhi Vatsa from Sonibad, Kerala's brother Praveen, Dr.
A large number of people like Swapna Banerjee and Aalesh Pandey from Bihar's Kadihar have been asking me to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov.
On August 16, the country and the world were immersed in grief and heard of the time of Atal ji.
14 years ago, he took over as Prime Minister.
In a way, he has been away from radical politics for the past decades.
He did not get a place in the news, he lived away from public life.
Although the New Year is a big gap, the country and the world have seen that after the 16th of August, this decade has not had any gap in the minds of the common Indians.
Atal ji's love, suffering and sorrow have grown in the country, which shows his vast distinction.
Over the past few days, the most important dimensions of Atal ji have emerged before the country.
People remembered him as a best member of the best Parliamentarian, a compassionate and best speaker, a people-hearted Prime Minister and remembered him.
Atal ji would have been grateful to the nation for bringing good governance into the mainstream
But today I would like to tell you about one more dimension of Atal ji's widespread governance, and I would like to touch it and the benefits that Atal ji's political culture to India, his efforts to change it and his efforts to formally make it systematic will be very beneficial in the days to come.
This is sure.
India would have been thankful for the 91st Constitution Amendment in 2003.
This change has resulted in two significant changes in the politics of India.
First, the number of ministers of the States should be only 15 percent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly.
Secondly, in accordance with the law against the party, he increased the amount of one-third of the previous members and made two-thirds of the members.
Further, there were clear norms for ensuring membership of those involved in the party attack.
For decades, there has been a political culture of setting up big cabinets in India, and these big cabinets were not sharing the work, but to maintain the political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
Because of his action, money and expenditure were saved.
Moreover, there has been improvement in performance.
This is possible only by a propaganda like Atal ji, and a healthy tradition of our political culture began to live.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, the change was made at the time of presenting the budget.
Already, the budget was submitted at 5:00 in the evening according to the methods of the British.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
Likewise, today you are seeing discussions about conducting elections to the central government and the state governments in the country at one time.
On this occasion, I dedicate to Atal Ji, on behalf of all of us, to fulfill his dream of a successful and developed India.
While the discussion of the Parliament arises, it is spoken about shouting, shouting, adjournment, but if something good happens, it does not speak much about it.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament was over.
You will be happy to know that the capacity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the capacity of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
After the party differences, all MPs tried to make the Monsoon Session more useful, resulting in the passage of 21 Bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 Bills in the Rajya Sabha.
The Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
During this session, a number of important bills were passed for the welfare of the youth and the backward classes.
The process will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
Amendment Bill has also been passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of the underprivileged and tribal communities.
Moreover, there will be confidence in the minds of the humble people that prevent the atrocities of the criminals.
Any civilized society cannot tolerate injustice to women's power.
The country is not ready to tolerate the transgressors involved in sexual evil
Therefore, the Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has made it a way to punish a severe punishment.
You might have read a few days ago that a court in Mandsor, Madhya Pradesh had inquired of the case within two months and sentenced two offenders, including the girl to sexual abuse.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh finished the trial in just five days and punished criminals.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have given quick judgments in such cases.
The Act will be an instrument in preventing crimes committed against women and girls.
When we move ahead with the welfare of the country, we can transform the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
This time, in the rainy season, all of them have set a special model.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions of people has been on the Asian Games in Jordan.
Every day in public newspapers, television, news and social web sites, it is the first to see which Indian soldier has won the medal.
Asian Games are now underway.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to the sportspersons who will be participating in the event.
India's sportspersons, especially in the shooting competition, have achieved immense achievements, but our sportspersons are getting medals even in the unprecedented fields of Wushu competition and boating before our performance.
These are not medals - the testimony of the hopes and dreams that fill the applications of Indian sports and sportspersons.
This is a positive sign that our women are also among the increasing number of medal winners for the country.
Our youngsters below the age of 15-16 will also be among the medal winners.
My best wishes to all on National Games Day.
You can imagine that we all have seen buildings and houses with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, they have carved a huge mountain, a rocky single hill, a very important, wide, magnificent temple, all this is beyond imagination, but this is happening, that too, the temple of Kailasnath in Ellora, Maharashtra.
Indias soil has been an engineering testing platform.
Several engineers have emerged in India, they have achieved what they cannot imagine, they have given examples of wonders known in the engineering world.
Millions of farmers and common people are still benefiting from the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam built by him on the banks of the River Turkey.
He has been devoted to these parts of the country, and the country also gives him respect in a sympathetic manner.
In his commemoration, we are celebrating the 15th of September as Engineers Day.
The engineers of our country have put a separate mark across the world on the way he has shown.
While we talk about the miracles of the engineering world, a terrible earthquake occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
When I was working there as a selfish slave, I got the opportunity to go to a village where I had to meet a granddaughter who had crossed the age of 100 years.
He was kidnapping me, look at my house in the Kutch region and calling it a park.
He further said that this my house has seen three earthquakes.
I have met three earthquakes.
I understand them in the same house.
But there is no effect anywhere.
Several centuries ago, when the engineers of that period had constructed buildings in accordance with the regional environment, it was my mind that how the people could live safely.
Today, when we follow Engineers Day, we must think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural disasters.
As we meet in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, we are speaking openly, we will take the country forward through our minds, we will be united.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, greetings
Even though India's vastness and diversity are on one hand, at times the rain shows its distinction.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, nature has expressed its anger at some times.
Therefore, we must be natural lovers, preserve nature and preserve the nature only then there will be a deterioration in the gifts of nature.
A natural disaster incident that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the world and driven humanity.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave and come out.
But the sports of the law were different on that day.
After they went a long way inside the cave, there was a lot of water accumulated in the doors of the cave due to sudden hard work.
They stopped the way out.
They stayed on a small rock inside the cave, not a day or two days, but for 18 days.
Just imagine how those little boys will have to spend every moment when they don't die in front of the eyes
On the one hand, they were learned in a large number, on the other hand, the entire humanity was uniting and reflecting the humanity of God.
People from all over the world were engaged in prayers to bring these children out safely.
It is not that the fathers are not sorry or the mother's eyes are not bigger.
It was astonished all over the world to see that the children were not able to lose their faith while expressing so much adventure and heart in a dark cave full of water.
This happens to us that when humanity stands together and wonders happen.
But it is necessary that we should work in order to achieve the goal of peace and firmness.
Just a few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Niraj ji, had left us all.
He has a special significance - confidence, self-confidence and satisfaction.
The months of July-August are extremely important for the farmers and all the youth.
Because these months are the peak season of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathya come out of school and join colleges.
In February-March months, examinations are for question papers and answers, the months of April-May are enjoying holidays, and the decisions are to decide the direction to travel in life and what industry to do.
In July, the focus of the youth is away from questions and goes on the cut-off assessments, which is a very important period.
The attention of the students goes away from the house and goes to the school.
Students get away from the umbrella of Petro and join under the umbrella of Professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting college life.
This is the first time when you leave the house and leave the village and leave a safe environment and start driveing yourself.
For the first time, all these youngsters have left their homes and have come out to set a new direction for their lives.
Many students will join their colleges, some will be online.
Everything I want to tell you, stay calm, feel your inner mind completely in life, there is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to read, and at the same time make yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There is a unique value for old friends.
Young friends are very valuable, while selecting new friends, reading and pursuing friendship is a big intellectual step.
You can learn some new things, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new lamp.
While talking about the college season, the news came to light that Asharam Chaudhary, a student from the poorest family in Madhya Pradesh, has succeeded in crossing the difficult challenges of life.
He has been selected for the first time in the medical examination of Jodhpur AIIMS (AIIMS).
His father works as a sanitation worker and works for his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
The students of such a poor family have achieved their unprecedented endeavours and strivings to cross the bad conditions.
Their achievements give us an impression that the father of Kushi from Nagpur is a driver in a school bus, Karthik's father from Haryana is a policeman, Ramesh Shahu's father works in a brick hole in Jharkhand, and the student Ramesh is also selling sports goods at the festival
Likewise, Anushka Panda, a disabled girl from Gutka, has been suffering from spinal muscular atrophy since birth...
They all have achieved the achievements of the world that they have been able to see the world back with satisfaction and break the barriers of belief.
If we roam around around us, we can know many such examples.
Any good thing that happens in some corner of the country is filled with energy in my mind and inspires
When I talk about such youngsters, I am taking care of them, this is the meaning of life.
Nirja ji's poetry dresses - I want to listen to the songs of the earth, I want to invite all of them to the light I want to remove the brutality of the person with flowers, I want to wash the mountains.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes went on a news that two youngsters had fulfilled the dream of Modi.
When we read it further in detail, today our youngsters are trying to transform the lives of the common man using technology intellectually and constructively.
I was interacting with Indian youth in the city of San Jose, once known as the technology center.
I urge them to take time to think about how they can use their capabilities for India.
I had urged the country to come out of knowledge and talent and how to use the motherland.
Two IT experts from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, have taken a new initiative by accepting this challenge.
Using their professional capabilities, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together developed the Smart Gaon App and Intellectual Village App.
This App connects the villagers with the world and provides access to any information and information on their mobile phones.
Rae Bareli's residents, Panchayat leaders, District Judges and District Governors have made aware of the use of this app.
If you look at this event smoothly then we should consider that these youngsters are living in the midst of lifestyle and ideals from the United States and are emotionally connected to their village even though they have left India several years ago, they have understood their village and have understood the challenges and are emotionally associated with their village.
This is the reason why the needs of the village have been well understood and worked accordingly.
Every Indian is naturally thirsty and thirsty to achieve something for his motherland with his village and roots.
But sometimes due to the compulsions, distances and conditions of the time, this feeling is slightly reflected in it, then this feeling is dragging itself towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
About 15-20 days before Adi Akademi, travellers are walking with teeth for a sacred pilgrimage to Bandarpur.
This pilgrimage is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gyaneshwar Swamis and Tukaram Swamis are singing and singing villains and lyrics and singing at Bandarpur.
Pilgrims come there to visit Vital Bhagwan, known as Vittoba or Pandurangan.
Lord Vietal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the victims.
The devotees of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with difficulty and devotion.
To visit Vittoba Temple in Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all unique experiences.
I appeal to the leaders of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, once you enjoy the Bandarpur warri.
Many great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas Swamis and Tukaram Swamis are still guiding the common people of Maharashtra.
They are providing strength to fight against blind faith and inspiring the traditions of these great men in every corner of India.
We have a great message about the importance of Parud singing, humility, harmony, love and brotherhood.
As the great heritage of the great ones who sacrificed themselves in the footsteps of God was in our country, as well as great men who dedicated themselves to the mothers of India, who sacrificed their lives to her.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilak, who has put an unprecedented mark in the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate Tilak's birth anniversary on 23rd July, we observe his commemorative day on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak is full of courage and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and innovation that directly pointed to the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very attracted by Lokmanya Tilak.
When Lokmanya Tilak passed away on 1st August, 1920, Patel ji promised that he would have a memorial.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected as the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipality, he immediately chose the Victoria Garden, named after the UK ueen, to mark the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Accordingly, the British were supposed to see this act, so the ruler continued to refuse to allow it.
Interestingly, Gandhijis addressing the inaugural function, said that after the assumption of Sardar Patel, the University of Ahmedabad has not only got a good man but also got a heart because of which the statue of Tilak has been built.
My dear countrymen, the speciality of this stealing statue is that this stealing statue is very rare, in which he is seen sitting on the chair and self-esteem is engraved under it as my birthplace.
I am shared with you by the British on the occasion of our year.
Because of the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak, there is a tradition of celebrating socially Ganesh festival.
Our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history can still be understood by this that there is a great attraction in our younger society.
Today, in almost all the streets of many cities, we can see the bundles of worshiping Ganesh.
I would like to extend my best wishes to all the cities to have special competitions on the occasion of favourite Ganapati Festival, to give them prizes, to MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
I will definitely take your views to the people.
Every Indian should reach the goodwill and the beneficiaries of development.
This will create a New India.
Tilak was born 50 years after his birth i.e., on 23rd July, another Satputra of Mother India was born.
He dedicated his life to the people of the country to breathe free air.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Whatever young man of India is inspired by these words inspiring, "Revolution is thirsty in our hearts, let's see the power of others, these poems have become a concept of many youngsters like Ashfakulla Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's valour, his urge to freedom, inspired many youngsters.
Azad ji kept his life money, but he did not salute the foreign rule.
I got a big pole to go to Alirajpur, a village of Chandrasekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak and Chandrashekhar Azad, I will showcase my memories with difficulty.
Hima Das, the hero of India and the daughter of the farmer, has won the gold medal in the 400m race in the World Time Championships held in Finland a few days ago.
Another woman in the country, Ekta Payan, has written for my letter from Indonesia through e-mail and now she is preparing for Asian Games.
It gives me great pride that whenever a moment of great significance in the life of the brave, it is to hold the flag in the hands of the tricolor on the world platform, I have done it.
Ekta, we all are proud of you.
You have made the country proud.
In Tunisia, he won Ekthan Gold and Bronze medals in Grand Prix 2018, the World Competition for Disabilities.
His achievement is that he has transformed the challenge of Disability into a means of success.
Despite the road accident in 2003, Ekta Payan's lower organs became inactive, he did not lose his heart, strengthened himself and achieved countless goals.
Another Divyangjan Yogesh Katuniya ji has won the gold medal in Grand Prey, Gold medal in Grand Prey, along with Sundar Singh Gurjar ji, who has won the gold medal in the brick swimming event in Berlin.
I convey my best wishes to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Katuniya ji, Sundar Singh ji, to all the self-confidence and unsuccessful thirst.
You have to move further, play more, funny.
My heartfelt countrymen, in August, there are several events and festivals of history, but sometimes due to the weather, diseases are also putting their feet in the house.
I convey my best wishes to you all for this month of August and several centuries of celebrations that have been going on for the good health of all of you and for the inspiration of patriotism.
Once again we will meet Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, there was a historic cricket game in Bangalore.
You all have understood that I mention the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that this is the first international test fear of Afghanistan and the historical test fear of Afghanistan with India.
President Ashraf Khani also tagged me and said in a tweet that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for establishing a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their capabilities.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This game will be forgotten for all.
I consider it a very important thing for one and another reason that it is worth remembering because of the first lap.
The Indian team has shown a glimpse to the whole world.
We can understand the nature of sportspersons from this event.
It shows that sports is an excellent way to connect the world and bring out the capabilities and capabilities of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan teams.
I am confident that in the future, we will play with each other in the spirit of sports and develop.
My dear countrymen, when we celebrated the 4th International Yoga Day on June 21 last year, the entire world joined it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, a historic event of Yoga has been organised in which women have performed large numbers of asanas.
In the highest peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together studied yoga.
And some of the soldiers studied yoga in the ship
Likewise, some soldiers have studied yoga on the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground in the middle of the air and depressed all.
It is worth mentioning that they did not do it as they were sitting on the plane, they did it as they were swimming in the sky.
Yoga practices were conducted at all places like schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There were about 750 Divyang brothers and sisters who joined together and got the world famous Yoga.
Yoga has done the task of connecting the people of the world without any control of caste, religion and geography, and we have lived for centuries with the spirit of Vasudhaiva family and unity all over the world.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
Whenever there is difficulty, we remember doctors
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of the doctors, I thank them.
Our country's doctors have recorded their marks all over the world due to their capabilities.
While our physicians are efficient and hardworking in the medical industry, our physicians are also known to solve complex medical problems.
India is a prosperous historical country as a day or not a month or not, which is a historical event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabir Dasar went to Makhar.
Pilgrim Kabir Dassar stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poem forms of poetry, sages and poetry.
This was his objective.
This goal is seen in his works and in today's world it is equally conceptual.
Behold, listen to one of his shoes - Kabir Soi Bir Hai, Jo Jane Bir Bir, Jo Par Bir Na Janahi, So Ka Peer Men Bir.
Kabir Dasar stressed on social harmony.
What does he mention in another Doha
Where there is love and grace, there is sin.
He also added Jadi Na Puchso Satuki, Puch Lejie Gyan.
Do not ask the saints what their tribe is, and seek wisdom from them.
He urged the people to cross the time of caste and to accept and respect the people with their knowledge.
His ideas have been affecting the centuries and even today.
He said that Guru Nanak Dev ji is a voluntary voluntary service to the poor and the needy.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of support for social benefit.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji had introduced the cooking system of Langar.
In 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is being celebrated.
I want all of us to participate in this with enthusiasm and zeal.
The freedom struggle of India is very long, wide, very deep and full of many sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 will be 100 years, which is a matter of embarrassing humanity.
My heartfelt countrymen, Raman Kumar Ji from Rohini region of Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all I thank you.
I am delighted to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji's day i.e. on 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
Many people would also know that Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji had spoken in Bengal at the convocation ceremony of the University of Kolkata in his invitation to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji.
It is notable that this was the first time that the British spoke in Bengal at the convocation ceremony at the University of Kolkata during their reign.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the first Minister of Industries in India and even if he had laid the foundation stone for Indias industrial development, if he had laid a strong foundation stone then it would not be surprising.
In the first industrial policy of Freedom India, which was released in 1948, his ideas and vision were a ruined impression.
Dr.
Mukherjee's dream is to make India self-reliant and self-reliant in every sector.
While India will develop big businesses, he wanted to pay full attention to small and medium enterprises, handicrafts, wet and cottage industries.
In order to provide financial and institutional platforms for holistic development of small and medium enterprises, he built all the artisans boards, allied Handloom Boards, Artisans and Rural Industries Board from 1948 to 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jis contribution is also there.
He was indebted to the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellectual and positive action, a large part of Bengal was saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video conference.
It was an opportunity to go beyond the appeals and learn directly from them about the changes in life.
When he knew about a common man... his simple words, his experience language, the event of him, like a reflection of mind.
Women from far-flung villages are providing services from pension to passport to senior citizens in villages through the Common Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister is collecting cereals and making ice cream and selling it.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters and people of the country are running medicines and also going to the nearby villages and providing expensive medicines.
Schoolchildren from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management in the tincture lab at their young age.
More than the success of the common man, the power of the country, the strength of the dreams of a New India, the strength of a New India, and the strength of a New India.
On the contrary, there are some such people in the society - unless they talk about depression, unless they develop inability, unsuccessful unbelief, unless they seek a path of diversity and universe.
When we talk about the events that took place in our lives with the common man, new hopes and new zeal in this kind of environment, I did not consider it as a success that the government had won.
The story of a small woman from a far-flung village has become an inspiration for 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the people of the country.
40-50 lakh people are connected through this video bridge and you have given me a new energy.
Once again I would like to thank you all.
I have always seen the truth that if we look around us, somewhere, some good thing will certainly be seen in our eyes.
There are people who understand goodness.
We can also face the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention, that is a very unique link.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Farmers associated themselves with it, they made schemes and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Experts and engineers have trained the farmers through this Trust to teach new strategies of agriculture, how to do organic farming, how to cultivate other crops in the fields including a thousand.
Today they are not only cultivating vegetables, marketing their vegetables and selling their vegetables at a good price and also the farmers producing cereals are connected to it.
In another way, I am glad that these youngsters, engineers and technicians associated with the world have come out of their circles, connected themselves with the farmers, connecting themselves with the villages and working together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your young man is really conceived to any young man.
Other youngsters of the country will definitely visit their portal and take care of their work and they will also get inspired about how they can work in various fields of society in their respective areas.
One dream for all the people of the country, One Nation One Tax is realized.
If anyone has to appreciate the implementation of the same tax reform system, I would like to congratulate the states as I am.
27 GST meetings have been held so far, people with different political views are sitting in it, people from different states are participating, states with different priorities are participating
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being levied.
The success of the GST currency and the celebration of currency actions.
On arrival, checkpoints have come to an end, logistics is going on at a rapid pace, due to which time is left and there is considerable profit in the goods service sector.
Maybe the world's largest tax reform.
Normally, when such a big reform, such a big country, such a big society, it was considered that it could take 5 to 7 years to complete it
This is the biggest success and this success has been achieved by 125 crore people.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Greetings.
Once again I got the opportunity to meet you all through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I think you all will remember that a group of six women commanders of the Indian Navy has travelled for several months.
They have travelled through various oceans and many seas and crossed about 22,000 seas.
This is the first such journey in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women jewels and listen to their experiences.
Once again I convey my best wishes to them for their excellent work, especially for the women of India, who have not been foolish in the world for their courage, naval pride and the importance of the country.
No one knows the spirit of adventure.
For centuries, the Everest Summit has been a challenge for humanity and has come to the forefront of this challenge.
On 16th May, a group of 5 tribal students from an Ashram School in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, including Manisha Truve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Matvi, Kavidas Kathmote and Vikas Soyam, has climbed the highest peak of the world.
The students of Ashram School started their training in August 2017 and trained at Warda, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youths were selected under the SHAURAYA Abhiyan training programme
In accordance with the name, they established the pride of the country at the Everest peak.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the students of Chandrapur School and my young friends.
Accordingly, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak from India, the youngest Indian woman from Nepal to the Everest Peak.
Congratulations to Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Diya will join the first father and daughter of India to touch the Everest peak.
It is not that a young man is climbing on the Everest peak.
On May 19, Sangeeta Behel ji climbed the Everest peak over 50 years of age.
Some of the climbers on the Everest peak have shown that they have the ability and emotionality.
In the past, according to the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, a team of coastal police personnel climbed on the Everest peak, but when they came down, they brought the solitary dustbins with their hands.
This is a commendable thing, while this move shows the vision of cleanliness and environment for them.
For years, people have climbed the Everest peak and many of them have succeeded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these brave soldiers, especially to women.
My heartfelt countrymen, especially my dear young friends, when I had spoken about Fit India two months ago, I could not imagine that there would be such responses.
I don't even think all sections of the department will support it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the country will be involved in sports as much as we are engaged in sports.
In social media, people share fitness challenges i.e. fitness challenges and tack each other and challenge each other.
Today, everyone is joining this mission called Fit India.
It reflects that if they are filmmakers, sportspersons, the common people of the country, the army personnel, the school teachers, we are sexy in four sides, India will remain firm.
I believe that liberating such a challenge is helping us to keep ourselves sexy and inspire others to sex.
Savi Yadav ji, thank you for your phone call.
It is true that the sports played on the streets were part of every child's life, they are passing through today.
In particular, these sports have been an important part of summer vacations.
In the midnight, after dinner, children shall play for hours, and shall not take any anxiety, or any thing.
In some of these sports, the entire family was able to participate and play.
Several sports like Kittip Pul, Pambaram, Koli, Aisbai, Thirden Police, Kannamuchi, Ko-Ko, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrupam are part of the young man.
Yes, they might have been called by different names at different places.
For instance, the game, known as 7 Stones, is known as Lahori, Pittu, Satholia, Tikori, Satodia.
In these sports, we see the unity of living behind the diversity of our country.
One sports is known in different places and in different names.
I am from the state of Gujarat, I know about a game called Somal-Isto.
It is played in a 88-8 square plate with a bowl or a bowl.
It was played in almost all the states.
In Karnataka, it is called Chaukabara and Attu in Madhya Pradesh, which is participant in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Sangabo in Rajasthan.
I don't know how to speak in every state language, but only after playing, it came to know that we have also played it.
Is there any of us who don't drive kitty bulls, killi
It is known by various names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra, it is called Kotibilla or Karabilla, in Odisha it is called Kulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Viditalu.
When everyone winds, when everyone plays, we can demonstrate the unique qualities that we have.
You can see how many children are humiliating, but when they play, they will become very active.
They express themselves, appear very deep, the childhood hiding inside them is revealed.
How to determine the goal, how to reach the mind, how to create a team spirit and how to create mutually beneficialness.
I can see that our traditional sports are now being used in training programmes related to business management, to promote holistic governance and to develop mutual skills.
From children to adults, when everyone plays together, the gap of generations is that it disappears gradually.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports provide awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, playing on the streets and slopes, they will also see these games, play and develop.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India is officially organising World Environment Day celebrations.
This time BEAT PLASTIC POLUTION is a matter of consideration.
I appeal to all of you to understand the importance of this theme and take a decision to avoid the use of polythene, low quality plastic, to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on nature, wildlife and our health.
Enter the World Environment Day portal Wed-Chia 2018, a lot of suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - see, know, try to adopt them in your daily life.
When there is heavy heat, when there is a flood, when there is no rain, when there is no unbearable cold, everyone becomes experts, he speaks about global warming and environmental change
Over the past few weeks, we have seen catastrophe, strong winds falling in many parts of the country as well as bitterness, this is not a natural weather.
This has also caused deaths.
All these are mainly the result of climate change
Our culture and our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We must live in music with nature and be integrated with nature.
The Gandhians took this thing forward in their entire life and in every step.
We will not only stop the trees but also provide a way to maintain it till it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
This is the message of Yoga and harmonious society for unity, which the world has once again experienced over the past few years.
Yoga becomes a psychological magnificence, which always protects us like a father.
For example, there is a feeling that it is like the mother of the children, the mindset becomes our sustainable friend.
Partruhari said that due to continuous yoga, our children, ourselves, our brothers and mindset become our brother, the earth is our bed and wisdom is absorbing our hunger.
If all these qualities are his companions, the yogi sings a victory over all kinds of fears.
Once again I invite all the people of the country to carry forward the tradition of Yoga, to build a healthy, pleasant and harmonious nation.
Today, on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, is a memorial.
I salute Pandit ji.
This month of May is connected to another person, he is Veer Savarkar.
In 1857, during the same month of May, our nations expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers have opened a team against injustice and expressed their patience.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, what happened in 1857 was called rioting or military revolt.
In fact, this is not just an estimate of the event but an attempt to disgrace our self-esteem and pride.
Veer Savarkar wrote in 1857 without fear that it was not just a rebellion, it was the first war of independence.
In collaboration with Savarkar, several freedom fighters celebrated its 50th anniversary in India House in London as a sword.
He is an expert in handling arms and weapons.
We usually know Veer Savarkar for his bravery and for his struggle against British imperialism
But in addition to all this, he has always strengthened the unprecedented poet, social reformist, harmony and unity.
I remember that our beloved Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said about Savarkar ji.
He was a poet of understanding and was a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of our glory and aspirations.
If you have a desire to achieve something, you will be able to overcome all the difficulties if you decide for it.
This is the story of some people who dedicate themselves to fulfill the dreams of others.
Prakash Rao is his.
You will be surprising to know that the common man who sells tea is taking the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children today.
He provides all the facilities for education, health and food to all the children who come to school.
I convey my best wishes to Prakash Rao ji for his untiring hard work, his endeavour, for illuminating the lives of the poor children and for giving him a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in their lives.
Who knoweth not the word of the word Damaso Maa Jothirgamaya
But if there is a person who has done it, then he has a T.
His life is a concept for all of us, society and the whole country.
This kind of inspiration can happen around you.
In a few days, they will also wait for the visit of Jayachandra.
I believe that everybody will celebrate this day with great zeal and at this time the children will get a good lunch prize for a long time.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in this.
Thousands of sportspersons from all over the world are participating in such a big event, you can imagine the situation.
And if there is such an environment, if there is no effect on it, if there is a desire to achieve enthusiasm, hope, motivation, aspirations and aspirations
India has achieved an unprecedented achievement till date.
Winning medals is a matter of pride for the winners, but it is also a matter of pride for the entire country and for the people of the country.
Encouragement and motivation are boosting.
We all mix together with the same feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I would like to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
If I am special, many things have been done for the first time.
This time, all the soldiers who have participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has won medals in all the sports he has participated.
He is the first Indian woman to win the Gold in the Table Tennis Single Games.
India got a lot of gold in the shooting competition.
The only Para Power Lifter of India won the medal in the Sachin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if this time the competition was specific, the majority of the winners were women.
Whether it is Squash, a knife, a weighty, a gunball competition, the women's heroes have shown their capabilities by playing very well.
The final competition of the Phupnadium is two heroes of India - Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
Sindhu also took place.
I was asking you to join Fit India and lead it.
I am glad that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Many have written letters for their support and shared important matters of sex and fit India information in the social media.
A person named Sashikant Bonsley shared the film that he took in the swimming pond and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my loneliness, swimming is my world.
Know what Ruma Devnath has written I feel happy and healthy after walking in the morning
As for me, smile smiles smiles and smiles when we are happy, he has written to smile.
After seeing all these things, it is very good that many renowned people are also inspiring our youth in very interesting ways for Fit India.
Film star Akshay Kumar has welcomed a video conferencing on Twitter.
His second video is also very popular, in which he can see handcuffs with the people.
Many youngsters are sharing their experiences by connecting themselves with Fit India initiatives.
Not alone - your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the age-old men and women should be associated with Yoga art.
You must have deepened the idea of how to enjoy holidays and where to go.
Today, I invite you to work for a new job
I can see many youngsters spending their time to learn something or the other.
The significance of the Summer Summer Training is increasing, the youngsters are engaged in search of this thing, training is a new experience.
Outside the four walls, one gets the experience of living in a new dimension, crossing the work and computer.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India - Sports, Human Resource Development and Water Resources - are jointly organising Swachh Bharat Summer Training 2018.
Go to MyGov portal and register yourself to participate in the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youngsters will take this campaign for cleanliness further.
You must send the information you have with, send photographs and give video conferencing.
Come on
We will have a new experience and a chance to learn during this holiday.
A few days ago, the youngsters of Delhi were showing a thing about some people in the Kut News India and they are serving the poor children to teach them.
These youngsters have taken up a massive campaign to educate the street children and children living in the cottages of Delhi.
They started this innovative activity because the conditions of the children who were slaughtering on the streets or slaughtering them in retail jobs.
This campaign, which started with 15 children in the dwelling area near the Gita Colony of Delhi, is connecting 2000 children to 12 places in the capital today.
Youngsters, teachers and teachers who are associated with this mission are trying to make changes in the society for 2 hours in their daily schedule.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have become a catalyst for the farmers across the country.
Due to their integrated efforts, they have not only enriched their position but also enriched the future of their region.
In Bhageshwar, Uttarakhand, particularly small cereals, vegetables, buttermilk and parli are cultivated.
Being a hilly area, the farmers did not get the right price for this
They have set up a cooperative system in Munnar village where they have set up a biscuit factory.
Seeing the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Rural Region Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being included not only in nearly 50 Anganwadi centres of Bhageshwar district but also in Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this system has not only increased to Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs every year, but it has also prevented the people from coming out of the district from creating employment for more than 900 families.
Everyone speaks about it, but isn't it our duty
We don't think water conservation is the responsibility of society
This must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we store every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have been implementing this thing for centuries.
They have given priority to the importance of water every drop.
They have discovered new ways and have understood how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, you must have noticed that some of the temples there are large inscriptions related to water conservation system and dry time arrangements.
In Mannarko, Cheranma Devi, Temple Pitti and Thiruvananthapuram all the major inscriptions are available.
Even today, we should not forget that various curriculum wells are known as tourist destinations, which are still a living example of our ancestors of the water conservation campaign.
Atalaj in Gujarat and Rani Ki Wave in Patan have been declared as the world heritage destination of UN Education, Science and Cultural Organisation.
In the months of April, May, June and July, we have a very special opportunity to storage the rainy season, as much as we are in advance as we are ready.
The budgetary scheme of Mahatma Gandhi Rural Area Employment Scheme is being spent only for water storage and water management.
In the last three years, all of them have been making their own efforts for water conservation and water management.
An average expenditure of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management across the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Area Employment Scheme every year.
In 2017-18, about 55 per cent of the expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent in water storage and water management.
In the last three years, more than 150 lakh hectares have been benefitted by water storage and water management projects like these.
Seven thousand people working under this project have worked hard in seventy days and revived the Kuttumberur river of Kerala.
Rivers of Ganga and Yamuna, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers like Sasur and Kadheri have dried up in Fatehpur district.
The district administration faced a huge challenge of land and water storage operations under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Area Employment Scheme.
With the help of nearly 40-45 villages, this dry sasur and kaderi rivers were revived.
Whether it be animals, birds, peasants, farmers or villages, how many blessings have you seen
The months of May-July are coming, we will also be able to take up some responsibilities for water conservation and water management.
My fascinating countrymen, before the sound of Mann Ki Baat, I have received news from four sides, letters and phone calls.
Ayen Kumar Banerjee ji from Devidola village of North 24 Barganas district of West Bengal has registered his views in MyGov - we celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year, but many do not know about the philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore who won the Prize.
Please talk about this in the Mann Ki Baat programme and there will be an opportunity for people to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a complete form of wisdom and wisdom and his writings have put an impossible mark in the minds of all the readers.
We can experience that Rabindranath is intellectual and diverse, but within him every moment there was a teacher's life.
He wrote in his Geethanjali, "He, who is the knowledge that the responsibility to inpart it to the students, that is, the students have the responsibility to teach it.
I was not aware of Bengali language but I had a habit of waking up early in my childhood, radio broadcasting in eastern India will start soon and will start late in western India.
When Anandloke, Aguner and Boroshmoni get an opportunity to listen to these poems, there will be a lot of inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have lived with you.
My dear countrymen, the holy month of Ramlan begins in a few days.
The month of Ramlan is celebrated all over the world with full comfort and dignity.
The social aspect of Nonbin is that only when a man is hungry, he feels hungry for others, when he is thirsty, he feels thirsty about others.
This is an opportunity to reflect the message and teaching given by the Mohammad Nabis.
It is a lesson that we learn from his life to travel on a path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a man asked the sovereign messenger that it was very important to do anything in Islam.
The Ambassador said that feeding to the poor and the needy, whether we knew, whether we do not know them, it is to be harmonious to everyone.
The Ambassador Mohammad believed in his wisdom and compassion.
Mohammad Nabi has said that if you have something more than your requirement, then you will give it to the people who need it and that is why the donor has been given more importance in the month of Ramlan.
People donate to the poor in this holy month.
The angels of Mohammad Nabis say that no person is rich because of his clean soul and not because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha inspires equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb empowered millions of people on the brink of the Constitution, be it the underprivileged, the victims, the destitute, the oppressed.
There is no better example than this for compassion.
The compassion and compassion of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Buddha.
In many Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, Buddhist traditions, Buddhist methods and their roots are included.
This is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with India's great Buddhist destinations.
Today, there are conflicts and sorrows of the people in everywhere in the world and the teachings of Lord Buddha are pushing the path of eliminating hatred with compassion.
I extend my warm greetings to all those who have faith in Buddhism, who have faith in compassionate principles, and all those who have faith in Buddhism all over the world.
I bless the entire world from Lord Buddha, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
You must have heard about the idols of Laughing Buddha, while telling them, it is said that this laughing Buddha will have the fortune, but some people know that Buddha, who is smiling Buddha, is associated with an important event in the security history of India.
Well, you can think of what is the link between Buddha and the Indian soldiers who are fond of fondness.
A new self-confidence has emerged from the Indian diaspora spread all over the world.
That day is also a Buddha Purnami.
On 11th May, 1998, India conducted nuclear weapons tests on its western border in Bokran, Rajasthan.
In a way, if we see India's testing successful, we can say that India has demonstrated its power in the field of science and technology.
On that day, in the history of India, the power of our armies was engraved in golden letters.
Lord Buddha showed that the power of Andama is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong in the form of a nation today, we can remain peaceful with all of us.
On that day, we have seen the world that under a strong leadership, India has the power to achieve new goals and peaks every day.
The journey that Atal ji started, the new joy and new joy that moved ahead will be seen before us.
My dear countrymen, once again we can join the voice of Mann Ki Baat, we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the pilgrimage day of Ram Navami.
On this auspicious day, my warm greetings to all the people of the country.
We were able to see in every moment of his life, how much the power of Ram was in the life of a devoted brother.
On January 26, when all the leaders of ASEAN countries came here, they were accompanied by a Cultural Committee.
It is a matter of great pride that most countries have given the Ramayana before us all.
That is, Ramayana is not only in India but also in ASEAN countries in this region of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, this time, all the letters, e-mails, telephone information and ideas of all of you have been received in a large number.
You have heard about the launch of Sanskrit lessons in MyGov online.
Besides, I am also happy to see your attraction towards culture.
I have told you about the efforts made by the concerned sector in this regard.
I appeal to all those who listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat and those who are engaged in the work related to Sanskrit, to suggest how to implement Gomal's idea.
Kanshyam Kumar ji, from Barkar village of Nalanda district of Bihar, I read the ideas you have written in the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed your concern over the declining level of ground water, of course this is an important thing.
You have been asking for drinking water for animals and birds in the summer season.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the leaders.
Do you know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said this time he is appealing to the youth about the health of the body.
He believes that our youth are physically weak as compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I think I should talk to everyone about health in detail - I talk about a healthy India.
You all, the youngsters, can join hands and implement a healthy India movement.
In the past, the President of France had visited Kashi when he visited our country and all the sights of that journey were fascinating and impressing.
I urge you to like them now, redue them, bring them to your friends.
Anka, Jayesh from Chennai, and many more children have sent me to write their thoughts on the gratitude cards found in the back of my book, Exam Warrior.
I would like to tell Annaka, Jayesh and all the children that when I saw your letters, all my fatigue of that day was hiding like a ice that saw everybody.
When I can read from all these letters, so many phone calls, opinions, I can hear, many things found in them are touching my heart.
If you want to talk about them only, I'll have to say in months.
This time most of the letters have been written by the children and they have written about the examinations.
They are sharing their holiday plans.
They have expressed concern over the water for animals and animals in the summer.
There have been letters from the farmer brothers and sisters regarding the functioning of farmers' festivals and farming across the country.
There have been positive suggestions from some citizens on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture and our tradition are taking place during the festivals.
That is, the matters of Mann Ki Baat are changing according to the weather and the truth is that the voice of our mind has changed the climate of life.
Why shouldn't you change
In these things, in your experiences, in these examples, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way, in such a way that you feel like doing something good for the country.
It has the power to change the environment of the entire country.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I came to know how Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj district of Assam, has set up 9 schools for poor children to study with his deep desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of treatment at the right time, the sister of Kolkata's taxi driver Saidul Laskar died.
He possessed his determination to set up a hospital in order to ensure that no poor person should die due to lack of treatment.
Saidul sold jewels and collected money from his house to achieve this goal.
Several travellers traveling in his taxi have given money in their hearts.
An engineer's sister donated her first month's wage.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, Saidul Laskar's favourite effort benefited
Today, due to his hard work, due to his satisfaction, a 30-bed hospital is being prepared in Puneri village near Kolkata.
A large number of conceptions are illuminating and introducing to my country.
Today, when the name of India is highly respected, the immense work of this Mother India's immense wealth is being laid behind.
Today, everybody has this confidence in the minds of the middle class and the youth of the country, in the women, in the backward and in the middle class people.
We can move forward, our country can progress.
There is a self-confidence and creative environment with aspirations.
This self-confidence, this positive feeling will fulfil our dream of a New India.
My heartfelt countrymen, these months will be of great importance to the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have been related to agriculture.
This time when I see the video conference of discussions with the farmers on the Kisan Channel for the farmers of Durdarshan, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the TD Kisan Channel of Durdarshan and see it and implement the uses shown there in his fields.
Whether it is Gandhians, be it Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, be it Lohia ji, be it Chaudhari Charan Singh or be it Chaudhari Devi, everyone has considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economic and public life of the country.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri also talked about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and excellent agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that we should ensure greater income for our farmers, specific irrigation facilities and increase the production of food and milk and make people aware.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh urged farmers to use new technologies and create innovations and stressed the need for this.
In the past, I had visited the Agricultural Development Festival in Delhi.
During the interaction with the farmer brothers and scientists, I had a pleasant experience to know, understand and know about innovations related to agriculture.
But I have had a great impact on the fact that Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers there.
This region, which has less land, has done a great job.
Our farmers from Meghalaya have achieved records in Meghalaya as compared to the last five years in 2015-16.
If the goal is determined, if the motivation is full, the motivation is deeper, they can achieve and have achieved.
Today, technology is also being handled to the hard work of the farmers, due to which there is considerable strength for the agricultural producers.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide affordable prices to the farmers.
Besides, work on Agricultural Marketing Reforms in the country is going on at a rapid pace to provide a fair price to the farmers.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets in the village, the gross electricity markets to the world market.
APMC and e-NAM platforms will be integrated while developing and enhancing the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country, so that farmers are not required to go far away to sell their produce.
That is, in a way, connectivity with any market of the country from the farm is being created.
My dear countrymen, this year the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of the Gandhians is the beginning of the festival.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our satisfaction, how can 125 crore Indians join shoulder to shoulder with shoulder to pay homage to the Gandhians
Can we organise new events
Can we build new ways
I urge you all to share your views on this by MyGov.
What could be the sign of 'Gandhi 150'
What can the fuck be
Let me write your views about these things.
Today, the country has crossed a common approach in the health sector.
All the works related to health in the country were earlier in charge of the Ministry of Health, but now all the departments and Ministries - whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, whether it is the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Ministries of Ministries of Ministries and Fertilizers, whether it is the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments - are working together for a healthy India, disease prevention and affordable health.
Disease prevention health is affordable and is very simple.
As much as we are aware of disease prevention health, there will be equal benefit to individuals, family and society.
Cleanliness is the first need for life to be healthy.
We are committed as a nation, as a result of which healthcare has doubled to nearly 80 percent in the last four years.
Besides, work is being done in a comprehensive manner in the direction of setting up health centres across the country.
As a preventive healthcare, Yoga has established its identity all over the world with new energy.
Yoga guarantees both physical and healthy.
This is the result of our endeavour and Yoga has become a mass movement today and every household has a place.
There are less than 100 days left for the next International Day of Yoga on June 21.
During the last three International Yoga Days, people participated with great enthusiasm in the country and all over the world.
This time we will also ensure that Yoga teaches all of us, the family and friends are inspired by us.
New interesting methods should be adopted to make it even more popular to all the elderly, children, youth and senior citizens.
Moreover, television and electronics from all over the country are providing various programmes related to yoga throughout the year
But from now on to Yoga Day - can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement
My sweet countrymen, I am not a Yoga companion.
But some people have converted me into a yoga philosopher through their creation and have created a three-pronged video conferencing like Yoga.
A comprehensive effort is being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all and to make the common man cheaper and easy.
Today, more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I appeal to the voice leaders of Mann Ki Baat that you should take information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras for those who need to be required.
This will be the biggest service you will do to them.
Heart stent prices for heart patients have been reduced to 85 percent.
Orthopaedic surgery fees have also been fixed and reduced by 50 to 70 percent.
Under Ayushman Bharat Swastha Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS (AIMS) hospitals are being opened in many states to provide better treatment and health facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts.
By 2025, the country has set a target to get rid of TB.
Today, the Make in India-Make in India campaign in the country is successfully working
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar ji had dreamt of India as an Industrial Power and his vision today inspires us all.
Today, India is emerging as a bright hub in the global economy and the highest FDI in the world is coming to India.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-sufficiency.
He does not want any person to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think that if he had shared something to the poor, his poverty would be removed.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India entrepreneurs, innovators and entrepreneurs from our younger community have been created.
Today, historical efforts are being made regarding the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built at various coasts of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
Most of the 40 debates were surrounding the Second World War, the emerging ice war and the partition of the country.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone for the spirit of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and stressed on the need to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of cooperative federalism - cooperative federalism in all aspects of the administration and competitive federalism - competitive federalism - competitive federalism
The most important thing is that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a concept of crores of people like me from the Backward Classes.
He has shown us that there is no need to be born in a big family or in a Siman family to move forward, and that in India, the poor families of the poor can dream, they can make every effort to fulfil those dreams, they can see success and success.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I appeal to you that you should participate with enthusiasm in this movement.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days many festivals will be held, such as Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to remind us of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, who spoke to us the message of non-violence, will give us an idea.
Greetings to all the people of the country on Mahavir Jayanti.
When we talk about Easter, the inspirational teachings of God will always be reminded of the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion for humanity.
Baisakhi Festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
In the same days, the festival of Jud Sheetal and Sathuvain in Bihar is celebrated with joy and joy and humor in Assam and Boila Baisa in West Bengal.
Once again my best wishes to all of you and to all the upcoming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
Initially, I start Mann Ki Baat with a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
We all know that the color of the sea is blue, but due to our daily experience, water has no color.
Whether it is the river or the sea, why do we ever think you look with color
The same question was raised by a young man in the 1920s.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
Satyendra Nath Bose ji's name was given to famous musicians, which is known as Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence-Watwani had participated in the inauguration of Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the science sector.
This artificial intelligence provides for creation of robots, b (B) trunks and specific functioning machines.
Today, the machines are making their intellect more intense through machinery.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
In this programme on Artificial Intelligence, I urge the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful to make the lives of the disabled brothers and sisters easier.
Can artificial intelligence know better about natural calamities
Can we help farmers in the field of farming
Can this artificial intelligence facilitate access to health services and help in diagnosing diseases through modern means
A few days ago, I had visited the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create Project in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man who had prepared a digital device
The young man said that if those who cannot speak are writing what they want to speak through this instrument, the instrument converts it into a voice, like interacting with one another.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific and Technology is a middle value.
They don't have any self-estimation.
Any machine works as we want.
Thomas Alva Edison, who found the light bulb, failed in many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, I have discovered ten thousand ways to make light bulbs.
That is, Edison has turned his failures into his power.
Today, I am in Aroville, the land of Mauritius Aurobindo, is not only an accident but also a great person for me.
As a revolutionary, he was a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them and raised many questions against their rule.
As a great Rishi, he questioned every aspect of life.
He also discovered answers to them and paved the way for humanity.
It is important to understand the truth and to raise questions again and again.
This is also the real concept of scientists in the background.
Why shouldn't you live until the answer to such questions is not known.
I extend my best wishes to our scientists and all associated with science on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh from Pune has written on the Narendra Modi App on Occupational Safety i.e. Industrial Security.
He said that in our country, the safety standards are not so important in factories and construction sites.
The Prime Minister has called upon the Prime Minister to speak in his mind about security as National Security Day on March 4, which will create awareness about security in the minds of the people.
While we talk about public safety, two things are very important - one to be alert and other to be prepared.
Security is of two types, one is crucial in disasters and the other is essential in daily life.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily lives and are not safe then it is difficult to achieve this situation in disasters.
Beyond this, these words do not usually have any advantage in our lives.
Most of the places are the result of our fault when we look at natural calamities.
If we are awakened, we follow the necessary rules, we can save our lives and save our society from greater hazards.
We might have seen many words about security in our workplaces, but we have seen that they are not following the slopes.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities that have fire brigades to be trained once a week or once a month in schools.
There are many natural calamities in this country, and the calamities created by the human beings related to the chemical and industry we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading the country on Disaster Management.
Autonomous volunteers have been trained in flood and cyclone risk districts.
Till 2-3 years ago, thousands of people died due to the heat wave.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) organised training courses on safety from the heat wave and launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
There was a good result of everyone's contribution.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to heat wave attacks decreased from expected to nearly 220.
It shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We must become a wary society against danger.
We have often carried out aeroplanes, and the aircraft carried out defence references at the very beginning of the flight.
Well, was there a system of providing information
Similarly, we have experience in every field of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, emphasis has been laid on sewage to wealth and energy generation in the villages through natural gas.
The initiative taken for this has been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources, i. e.
The objective of the Gobar Dhan Action Programme is to clean up the villages, to transform livestock food, crop wastes of fields into waste fertilizers and natural gas and to enhance wealth and energy.
Some European countries and China use animal food and bio-waste for energy production
But India is not fully functioning in this field.
Under the rural scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission, we are now moving forward in this direction.
It has been decided to improve the production of natural energy through livestock waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India have been encouraged and they should see food and waste as a wealthy instrument.
There will be new employment opportunities in waste harvesting, transportation and natural gas sales.
The Gobar-Dhan scheme will be implemented in a smooth manner and will provide a fair price for the crops of the farmers by connecting the farmers with the buyers.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard all kinds of festivals such as music festival, food festival and film festivals.
But a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh - the first waste festival of the state was organised here.
Inspired by Raipur and other districts also organized waste festivals for their participation.
Everyone shared innovative ideas related to cleanliness in their respective perspectives, participated in discussions and organized seminars.
There was an atmosphere like a festival from the centre of cleanliness.
This is a wonderful thing, especially the school children have participated with great enthusiasm.
I extend my immense greetings to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, to the people of Chhattisgarh, to the government and the government administrations of the state for the event in an innovative manner in waste management and the importance of cleanliness.
Every year, on March 8, we are celebrating International Women's Day.
Several events are being organized in our country and in the entire world.
In the past, women who have done examples in various fields have been awarded the Nari Shakti Puraskar on this day.
Today, the country is moving ahead in the direction of women-led progress.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's fond language.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of social and economic conditions is equal.
Today, our women are showing strength and self-confidence in their actions.
Where women are empowered and partners in all developments of the country, it is our own dream of a New India.
Starting on 26th January this year, in just 20 days, these women have constructed one lakh seventy thousand toilets, including about one lakh women groups.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that women have the power to transform it into a natural ability of a large number of people in the lives of the common man with the help of Swachhta Movement and Cleanliness.
Brothers and sisters, I came to know when I was watching the news two days ago about how much they were happy that in three villages of Eliphanda Islands, we were getting electricity after 70 years of independence.
I am surprised that despite being such a special tourist destination, it has not reached electricity for so many years after independence from close to Mumbai.
For 70 years, three villages of Eliphenda Islands - Rajbandhar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - were born in darkness from the lives of people drowned in darkness.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and to the people there.
May the lives of the people of the country be illuminated, the happiness of their lives increases, what can be the more pleasant and enjoyable moment
My beloved brothers and sisters, just a few days ago we celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
The month of March is the beauty of the green fields, the beauty of the smoothly floating crops, and the charming mango feedings of the mind - these are the specialities of this month itself.
At the same time, the Holly Festival in this month is close to our hearts.
On March 2, Holi festival will be celebrated across the country with great enthusiasm.
Holika is the most important of the colors in the festival of Holiban because on this day we drown all evils in the neighbourhood.
This is a comfortable moment that forgets all the differences and participates in each other's joy, confronting unity and brotherhood, the Holly Festival provides a rare message.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful and greeted.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathi ji has written a long letter on the Narendra Modi App and I would like to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji passed away on 1st February.
They are not with us today because of the Colombia space crash, but they are inspiring the youth from all over the world.
In this context, I express my gratitude to Prakash Ji for introducing his letter about Kalpana Chawla ji's passing day.
It is a matter of great sadness for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla at such a young age, but they have left the message that thousands of women in the world, especially in India, have no limit to women's power.
It is a matter of great pleasure that today women and women are progressing at a rapid pace in every field of India and are maintaining the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country and their contribution to the society has been surprising all over the world.
This speaks in detail about the importance given to women in our society.
That's why they have given the status of power to women in our society
It reflects the wisdom, devotion, the rule of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Laxmibai, the panditya of the entire Vedic period of Lopamudra, Karki and Maitrai, the knowledge of Aka Mahadevi and Meerabai, and the valour of the Vedic times, and the valour of Rani Laxmibai, which has always been inspired by us, the pride of the nation.
Prakash Tripadhi ji has given many more examples.
Our Raksha Mantri Nirmala Sitharaman ji expressed her condolences on the advent of flying in the sky at Sukoi 30, and said that the Indian Navy's women's team led by Vartika Joshi has travelled worldwide in the INSV Tarini cell.
Three talented women like Bhavana Khand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become fighters and are training Sukoi 30.
You're absolutely right.
Today, women are not only moving forward in all the sectors but also leading the leadership.
Today, for the first time in many sectors, women-services are being understood and one milestone is being established.
In the past, the President took a new initiative.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women in their respective fields.
These women recorders of the country have achieved extraordinary achievements such as the first female captain of the ships, first female train driver, first female train driver, first woman bus driver, first woman to Antarctica, first woman to reach Everest Summit, first woman to reach Everest Summit.
With the help of hard work, motivation and satisfaction, they have proved that they can cross all obstacles and obstacles and create a new path.
On this path, they are not only inspiring people of their time but also generations.
They have filled up new enthusiasm and new inspiration.
A book has also been written about the women's achievements and the first women who came to the country to know about these women's powers and to get inspiration through their lives.
This book is available today in the form of e-book on the Narendra Modi App.
Today, there is a significant contribution of women's power in the positive changes that are taking place in the country and society.
Today, when we are talking about the empowerment of women, I would like to mention a railway station.
You can imagine the connectivity between a railway station, women's empowerment.
All the workers at Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai are women.
This time, after watching the Republican Festival Parade, many people on Twitter and other Social Web Sites are very important, and all those present in this group are women.
They understood the adventurous acts, the exhibition surprised the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today, our Mahila Shakti is leading.
It is becoming self-reliant.
I see the wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh and they have given a new example.
While talking about tribal girls, there is a decisive scene in the minds of all, there are forests, roads, in which women carrying heavy weight on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have created a new scene before the country.
The Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh is a part of Maoist extremists.
Maoists like violence, repression, bombs, guns and gardens have created a terrible atmosphere here.
In such a horrific environment, tribal women are running rickshaws and becoming self-sufficient.
Besides, it is also being strengthened to protect the environment.
I appreciate the government administration here, they have made a significant contribution in the success of these women from funding and training.
Abolition of the disappearance, changes in the required.
Continuous efforts have been made individually and socially in the country for centuries against social disruptions and collapses.
A few days ago, a tasty procedure was taken in Bihar.
A human chain programme of more than 13,000 km away was organised in the state of Bihar by rooting social disruptions.
Awareness was inspired by this movement against evils such as child marriage and oppression.
All the people of the state resolved to fight against oppression and child marriage.
Children, elders, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters all came forward and joined themselves in this movement.
From the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain has been longer and unconnected to the border of the state.
If all sections of the society want to get the benefits of real progress, then our society should get rid of these evils.
Together, we will not disappear from the society.
Let us build a New India, a strong and powerful India.
For the past few years, people have been writing letters to me about this thing.
I have also seen several videos and social media about the beneficiaries of this scheme.
It gives me the feeling that the darshan was given to them and the idea of getting to others was awakened.
The objective of the scheme is to make healthcare regulatory and make life easier.
Pharmaceuticals available in Jan Drugs are 50 percent to 90 percent less than commercially printed medicines.
It provides economically beneficial benefits to the senior citizens, especially the daily use of medicines for the common man, which increases savings.
Generic medicines purchased here are similar to the standards of World Health Organisation.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 people's medicines across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurs have also created new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Hospitals, AMRUT shops are available in hospitals.
The only objective behind all this is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor people in the country so that they can build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji from Maharashtra is sharing a picture on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
The picture attracted me very much.
One of them joined his grandfather and participated in the Mornana River Cleanliness Mission.
The citizens of Akola have undertaken the cleaning of the Mornna River in connection with this Swachh Bharat Mission.
Though the Morna river is a river flowing for 12 months, it has now become a seasonal river.
Another tragic thing is that the river is filled with forests and waterfalls.
I was told that this cleanliness drive was pursued by 20th January, 2018 and this drive will continue every Saturday morning till the Mornana river is not fully cleaned.
It shows that if one decides to try, he cannot achieve anything.
The mass movement can also make big changes.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Akola, its district and municipal administration and all the citizens who have participated in the mass movement and for this endeavour, your efforts will be a conception for other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, discussions are going on on on the Padma Awards being conferred on the day of the President.
Newspapers and televisions are attracted to it.
But it is a matter of great pride for you when you look at it, and it is a matter of great pride for us to get awards and recognitions without any recommendation.
Now it is not necessary that a person should be awarded and popular, but his actions are being identified as his identity.
He has been manufacturing sports goods from waste for 40 years, so that he works for the children to get scientific interest.
It has been his endeavour to ensure that children get scientific tests done with unnecessary things
For this, he has gone to 3000 schools across the country and has been inspiring and screening video conferencing films in 18 languages.
Look at what a wonderful life, great dedication
The life of Sithavava couple of Karnataka is similar.
There is no point in calling him the goddess empowered to women.
He has contributed immensely to the transformation of the lives of innumerable women for the last 30 years from Belgavi.
Since his 7th year, he dedicated himself as a goddess and spent his entire life for the benefits of the gods.
Not only this, he has worked unanimously for the welfare of underprivileged women.
You might have heard about the Bajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, who was born in the poorest tribal family of Bajju Shyam.
Though he had done simple work for his livelihood, he had an immense country on traditional tribal paintings.
Because of this desire, today he has a value not only in India but also in the whole world.
His paintings have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, Britain and Italy.
Bajju Shyam, who has renowned the name of India abroad, has been identified and awarded the Padma Shri award.
The life of the tribal lady Laxmikuti of Kerala can be a pleasant surprise for you.
Lakshmikuti ji works as a teacher in the Kalar area and still lives in dense forests and tribal habitations.
After the snake was supplied, he was selected for the production of medicines.
Lakshmi Ji is constantly serving the society through herbal medicine knowledge.
Padma Shri has been awarded for his contribution to the society by identifying him who was not enthusiastic.
Today, I feel like telling one more thing, 75-year-old Subhasini Mistri ji of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistri ji washed utensils at home and sold vegetables to build a hospital.
Today, the hospital created by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, such people should be invited and shared with their experiences.
All the awards have to be passed and the society has to make some efforts.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate the day of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On the same day, Annal Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating an unparalleled bond between India and Indians around the world.
This year we organised a programme for overseas Indians in which Parliamentarians and mayors from India were invited from all over the world.
Indian diaspora in many countries such as Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States participated in the event.
Some of them have printed on cyber security, Ayurveda, music, poems, research on climate change, Indian literature and in many fields, they are making an identity for themselves.
Some people have constructed Gurudwaras from truck drivers, some have built mosques, that is, wherever we are, all those countries have improved in some way.
I express my gratitude to the members of the European Federation for recognising the excellent tasks of the NRIs and for their remarkable work to bring these information to both the warriors around the world.
Even in today's times, we look at how true the teachings of water are, at every stage.
If we decide to go under the foundation of Anna then what can we offer to him a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I extend my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Throughout the year, we have shared many things.
A large number of letters, ideas and ideas for the voice of Mann Ki Baat have always been giving me a new energy.
It will change the year after a few hours but our shares will continue to happen as ever.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for 2018.
A few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas festival as a goal.
We can also see the essence of service mindset.
This shows us what is the importance of service mindset.
In our country, we are talking about the rumourless act, that is, there is no hope of reflection in such a process.
"Seva Paramo Standard" is said to be the best faith in service.
My dear countrymen, this year Guru Gobind Singh's 350th birth anniversary.
An extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, full of courage and sacrifice, inspires us all.
Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a teaching on the great values of life and on the basis of those values he lived his entire life.
As a guru, as a poet, as a philosopher, as a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji has inspired the people through all these contributions.
He fought against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he has never placed psychological disintegration in his mind.
Every moment of life gave a message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen the uniqueness of such great features
I got the opportunity to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary Celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh Ji in Patna Saheb in the beginning of this book.
Come, let us all try to improve our lives by learning from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his conceptual life.
All those who were born in 2000 or after that, that is, born in the 21st century, will start becoming voters in 2018.
I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India in the form of democracy of India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I urge you all to go and register you as voters.
All India stands for you as voters of the 21st century.
Voting is an instrument that makes a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
You will not be empowered to vote.
In today's voice, I would like to talk about our respected young society, which is 18-25 years old, which is compassionate and efficient.
I consider them as the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of the country, the youth, the enthusiasm and the energy.
I am confident that the dream of a New India will be realized with the talent and strength of our strong youngsters.
When we talk about a New India, the New India must be free from caste, communalism, extremism and corruption.
It must be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in a New India and the aspirations and aspirations of all should be fulfilled.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India must be our guiding powers.
My new Indian youth, come forward and study how to build a New India.
Young people below the age of 18 to 25 can sit together and discuss new India, find ways and plans
How can we imagine our resolutions before 2022
Can we consider building a dream India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Gandhijis transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, it is important for us to create a mass demographic dividend to make the best India of the 21st century and this is a mass movement for progress.
How to achieve success through conscience
Today there are many new opportunities before the youth.
Our youngsters are moving forward from skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I had spoken of the importance of positive and positive thinking.
There is also a case in English - pessimism leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
I was asking in the last Mann Ki Baat that sharing the positive moments of 2017 and we will welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am extremely happy that a large number of people have given positive answers to the social workshops, MyGov website and the Narendra Modi app.
Positive India Hashtag has also made lakhs of tweets, which has reached more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this spread of positiveness has spread all over the world from India.
The incoming tweets and answers are really contemplating.
It was a comfortable experience for me.
Some of the people of the country have mentioned some of the events that have had a positive impact on their minds this year.
Some are sharing their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Batia.
I reside in Packet One, Face One, Delhi's Mayur Vihar.
My daughter M.
P.
She wanted to study.
For this, I needed a loan, it has been very easy for me and my daughter too could continue to study.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm living in the (B) pot.
My husband had made an accident insurance of one rupee a month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life.
We know about the bad situation that happened to us at that time.
With the help of the government, we have got a lot of benefit and we have been able to liberate a bit.
My name is Santosh Javadekar.
Our National Highway was laid in 2017 by the village behind us.
Because of this, our roads have become very good and our business has started to grow.
My name is Deepanshu Ahuja and I reside in the Sathaganj area of Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish (BEVANI) Pewani.
Since there is a lack of water in our area, we have been dependent on the army's water pipe for the past 40 years.
Now a pipe has been built for us alone...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people due to several actions in their respective conditions.
In fact, this is the New India, which we are building together with us.
Come, with these small joys, let us come to the New Year, start the New Year, from Positive Yalia to Progressive Yalia - from a creative India to a creative India.
When we all talk about positive ideas, I feel that I have to share one thing.
I heard about the story of Anjum Bashir Khan Kathak, who was elected in the excellent manner in the state of Kashmir state government elections.
He has emerged from the bond of extremism and detention and has been the best in the state's regime.
In 1990, you will be surprised to know that the extremists have burnt his old house.
When extremism and violence were over, his family was forced to throw out their ancestors of the soil.
He never left faith.
He guided a path for himself - it is a way to serve the people.
He came across the opposite situation and enjoyed his success story.
Today he is not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also inspiring allthindia.
Though the environment is so bad, Anjum has proved that it can dissolve the depressive clouds through positive actions.
Last week there was a chance to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
This is the strength of the country, these are my young wealth, these are the future of my country.
Millions of devotees come every year to this world-renowned temple to get the gift of Ayyappan.
But how to transform cleanliness into culture, how to find a way to solve the problem, how to transform people's contribution into power, the Sabarimala temple is an example.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an Action Plan called Purniam Parkvan, under which he started the nutritional Swachhta Abhiyan on Swachhta Awareness.
This pious park van movement, which has made such a progress in Sabarimala, has become a part of every traveller's journey.
There is also a strong resolution related to cleanliness along with difficult ruins.
My heartfelt countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, on the birth anniversary of Gandhian, we all made a resolution that the unfinished work of water is Swachh Bharat, a pollution-free India.
He had made efforts for this work throughout his life.
On the 150th birth anniversary of Anna, we decided to dedicate to him the India, Swachh Bharat, which he dreamt of, and contribute to that direction.
A comprehensive effort is being made in the direction of cleanliness across the country.
There is a widespread transformation in rural and urban areas with the help of public participation.
To measure the quality of cleanliness in urban areas, the world's largest study called Swachhta Survekshan 2018 will be conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018.
This study will include about 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
Open defecation free in the cities, collection of waste, transportation of waste, scientific waste processing, efforts to transform the movement, capacity building and innovative initiatives for cleaning and public participation in this work are the parameters.
According to this survey, various groups will go to cities and conduct research.
Speaking to the citizens, they will get answers from them.
They will review the use of Swachhta App and development of various service centres.
It will also be taken into consideration whether all the institutions have been set up by the cities to make the cleanliness of the city a peoples natural and natural city.
It is not that the government should only implement cleanliness.
It contributes to every citizen and citizen organisation.
On the basis of this survey, when the standards of cities are set up, if the population in your city is more than one lakh, the country-class standard and the population is less than one lakh, the area level level will be provided.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, through this programme, I would like to share one thing with you.
I was supposed to note that if a Muslim woman wants to travel to Haj, she cannot go without 'Mahram' or her male guardian.
When I was asked about this for the first time, how can it be
Why did this distinction ever appear.
For years, injustice has been done to Islamic women, but there has been no discussion about it.
Such a regulation is not in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to the Islamic women of India.
I am glad that our government has focused on this.
Our Minority Affairs Ministry has taken necessary steps and has ended the tradition of 70 years of continuation and has removed this control.
I am glad that today, Islamic women can go to Haj pilgrimage without a male guardian 'Maharam' and this time, 1300 Muslim women have applied for Haj pilgrimage without male guardians, from Kerala to North India, women from different parts of the country have expressed their desire to take Haj pilgrimage.
Ministry of Minority Affairs has been advised to ensure that all the women who have applied to visit Haj pilgrimage separately.
I am confident that the journey of India is progressing and progressing with the strength of our women's power and their knowledge.
Our sustainable efforts should be made to ensure that women have access to rights and opportunities equal to men and they will also see equal progress on the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on January 26, we all are historically important.
However, on 26th January, 2018, it will be remembered in a special way.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will be the chief guests of the 10 ASEAN countries in the Republic Day celebrations this year.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, will participate in this event, not only one but ten key guests.
This has not happened in the history of India so far.
In 2017, ASEAN was a special place for the organization and India.
ASEAN completed its 50-year term and in 2017, Indias collaboration with ASEAN reached 25 years.
It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will participate here on 26th January.
It's very rare that there will be no festivals any day.
Now we have celebrated the Christmas festival and then the New Year will be celebrated.
May the upcoming New Year embrace a lot of joys, happiness and fulfilment.
Let us all move with new temporary, new zeal, new motivation and new determination and progress the country.
Makar Sankranti will be celebrated in the month of January this month.
This is a time connected with nature.
Although every festival is connected to nature in some way, there is a habit of celebrating this wonderful event of nature in our culture with diversity.
If Lohri enjoys the pleasure of Punjab and Northern states, it is expected to come to Kichdi and Til Sankranti in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankranth in Rajasthan, Mag-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all these have a special significance and a special significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Although they are different in the name, the principle of their foundation is one - the link between nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to all the people of the country on these occasions.
Once again, best wishes to all of you for the New Year 2018.
Distinguished gratitude to the countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
It is doubtful that no one has respected him, no one has respected him, no one has respected him.
He was the older than all of us at the age of age, and witnessed at various stages and stages of the country.
This is a great learning experience not only for our new generation but also for all of us, even after you have achieved all these achievements in your life, you have always been the first to develop and work for your father.
This feeling is very close to me.
Nijama, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how much you're activating, how much you work and everything I'm doing to see, I know.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Moti ji: Because of your love, we're very happy.
Moti ji said, I am grateful to me for your continuation.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on my birthday.
Moti ji: This time when I came to Mumbai, I wanted to meet you.
We all celebrate many festivals like Navratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Deepawali, Baiya Dhuj and Chatpuja.
In many cities, many non-governmental institutions and start-ups of the youth are engaged in this work.
They collect all the garments, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and seek and bring them to them, they do it without any advertisement.
This time, in this season of festivals, will we break the darkness in the light with full awareness and compassion
The smile that smiles on the faces of many poor families will double your joy in the festivals, your face, your shine, your light, your light, and your light.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the occasion of Deepawali, the daughters are welcomed at home to provide a lot of feathers and abundant lives.
Traditionally, we welcome the daughters.
This time we welcome Mrs.
In our culture, we salute women as daughters, because women are considered good fortunes and fulfillments.
This time will we organise programmes in our society, in our villages, in cities and in our cities to honour women
We can organise public events and many women who have achieved their hard work and motivation will be amongst us in our family, in our society and in our country.
Can we organise programmes to give pride and value to these daughters of India during this Deepavali
Women who have done many extraordinary jobs may be among us.
One might have been trying to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some may have been engaged in some social service as doctors, engineers and teaching poor children.
As a prosecutor, he may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and take pride in them.
Just as we all driven a selfie campaign with daughters all over the world, we will take the initiative of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
Encouraging the daughters of India means ensuring the lives of the people of the country and the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already spoken about the voice of Mann Ki Baat, that is why I get the opportunity to interact with the unknown people.
In the past, Alina Thaiang, a student from far-flung Arunachal Pradesh, had written to me an interesting letter.
I belong to Roying area of Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my results came, some people asked me if you read the exam boards book.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I read this book and read it again 2-3 times.
After this I had a very sweet experience.
My gender students, I thank you for writing a letter.
I thank you very much for telling me about the grievances that are present in the course of reading
I will follow your command.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend and student Alina Thaiang from Arunachal.
My heartfelt countrymen, you will be aware of the incessant events of the Prime Minister of the country through the newspapers, through the TV, you will be discussing the unrelief and unrelief.
This time, Medvede's speech at the second in the final event was also spoken about the success of the US Open competition.
I also heard a lot of speeches on social web sites and then I saw the slope.
The simplicity of Medvede, who was 23 years old, was enjoyable for all.
If there were others at this time, he would have been regretted and disappointed, but he had no smile on his face, rather through his words, he made a smile in everyone's mind and grief.
His speech was welcomed by all the visitors from there.
In one stroke, the zeal of the producer and the wonder of the winners were fascinated.
If you have not heard Dann Medvede's speech so far, I especially ask the youth, please go and listen.
It has a lot of things to learn to all sections and to all ages.
These moments have crossed the failure of success and there is no meaning of success failure.
Life succeeds and our scriptures tell us all this thing in a very important way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are really surprising.
Mani Kanjana Samyog: Janayati Lokasya Loshan Anand... i.e. if a person gets the ability and work together, he cannot win his heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My heartful countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to tell you that it is for your direct benefit.
But if we get awakened from the beginning, it can be very safe.
I want to keep this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
It becomes very difficult for all of you to know that tobacco addiction is very bad for health.
Tobacco users have a greater risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure.
It has a greater effect on the growth of brain by reading it in childhood .
But today, I have come to share with you a new thing.
You know that now e-cigarettes are being banned in India.
E-cigarette is different from ordinary cigarettes.
In e-cigarette smoke, the liquid liquid in nicotine is wet, there is a kind of smoke in which nicotine is inserted.
We all know very well about the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but misconception of e-cigarettes has been detailed.
That is, there is no risk of this e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, there should be no foul smell in it, so they mix a smelling substance.
We might have seen that if a father is constantly smoking in a house, he would not want his children to have a habit of smoking like him.
It will be his endeavour to ensure that no one in the family should smoke.
Because he knows how bad the body will be smoking and smoking.
Those who smoke after knowing it, they also know it well.
But this is not the case of e-cigarettes.
People do not have such awareness about e-cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger, because of which sometimes e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, cigarettes are mixed with many harmful substances, which will have a bad effect on health.
If someone in the neighborhood smokes, its smell will be given to us.
That is why the dreams of every family should not be snatched on their feet.
Leave the habit of smoking, do not take any wrong idea of e-cigarette.
Come, let us together create a healthy India.
Yes, you don't remember Fit India.
Fit India doesn't mean that if you go to Jim for two o'clock in the morning and evening, you will not be sufficient.
It is also necessary to get away from these.
I believe you wouldn't feel bitter about what I said, of course it would happen to you very well.
They all dedicated themselves not to live for themselves, but to others.
He is honouring such a man on October 13 in Vedican.
Sister Lady Treasia is an example of the work done for the benefit of humanity in her 50-year-old life.
He had a great engagement in social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but also for the entire world that today when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the Gandhians, 130 crore Indians are committed to liberate themselves from the depths that have been used once.
Considering this, India is leading the entire world in the direction of environmental protection, today the vision of all countries is based on India.
I am confident that all of you will take part in the campaign to get rid of the ghee on 2nd October.
At many places, people are contributing to this movement in their own specific ways.
But a young man of our country has run a very unique movement.
When the milk of his work went to my attention, I used to call him and try to know about his new test.
For the first time when I heard this word of plogging, I got it new to me.
Perhaps this word may be more useful in foreign countries.
Helo Ributhman ji, greetings, I speak to Narendra Modi.
My heartfelt greetings to you.
If 130 crore Indians had taken one step in this direction then India would move ahead with 130 crore steps towards the direction of getting rid of the nets used once.
Ributhman ji, once again, thanks to you for my gratitude.
Besides, I congratulate you, your team and a new idea of this kind from my side.
Tengu.
My dear countrymen, the country and the world are working on the Musteps for the 2nd of October, but we want to travel on the path of 150 Gandhians.
We want to make changes in our lives and make progress in the interest of the country.
I would like to remind you of one thing in advance.
I will speak in detail about it in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, but why do I speak it just a little ahead today, will you also not have an opportunity to make it ready
You will remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji's birth anniversary.
All the children, the elders, thousands of schools and colleges, and millions of villages of India, on that day we have to drive for unity.
My dear countrymen, you must have remembered that on the 15th of August I had spoken from the Red Fort and I had been asking you to visit some 15 places in India by 2022.
At least 15 places, if possible, one or two nights will have to set up programs to stay there.
Once again I request you to visit some 15 places in India, please visit some 15 places in India.
And all this has been done only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My heartfelt congratulations to all of you, once again in a diverse India, for several festivals.
A few days ago, there was a possibility of telecommunicating with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times team's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper published a journal on children in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
They published some selected letters in that newspaper.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Kirti Hectare from North Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme, while talking about the need to transform our education system, there is no country for children on classroom studies in today's times, and they are very interested in knowing about nature.
If we provide information about nature to the children, then there is a chance to provide them natural protection in the future.
Rita Nadaf, a child from Lakshmeshwara, writes that she is the daughter of a soldier and that she is proud of it.
If you are the daughter of the army brave, you have no wonder what Irfana has written from Kalpurgi to 5 km from his village.
I am glad that a newspaper has taken such a step and I have got the opportunity to read these letters.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is on 26th November.
In 1949, today, the Constitution of India was adopted in the Constituent Council.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day we remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked hard for three years to enforce the Constitution of India.
It would be better for those who read those discussions and their dedication to the nation in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they will work for our country with a diversity of constitution
They did this while the country was freed from the slaves with understanding and vision.
It is the duty of all of us to build a New India by following the light of the Constitution and keeping in mind the obvious thoughts of those who gave the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very large.
There is no component of life that has not been found in it, there is no subject of nature.
It is our duty to follow without a single essence of the Constitution.
Whether it is citizens or rulers, we should move forward by understanding the spirit of the Constitution.
The aim of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any role.
It is natural to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today.
17 different groups were formed on the important matters of the Constitution.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft committee of the Constitution.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are enjoying the pride of giving the Constitution of India, a ruined stamp of Babasaheb Ambedkar Jis effective leadership has been recorded in building it.
He ensured that all sections of the society benefit.
On the hiding day of December 6, we will remember and pay homage to him, as always.
It is worth mentioning that Babasaheb's participation in making the country self-reliant and powerful.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji's sitting day.
Sardar Patel ji transformed the iron man from the point of view of being a farmer's son.
Sardar ji was also a part of the Constituent Assembly.
He was a member of the Consultative Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minority and Tribes.
How can this country forget 2611 of our Constitution Day 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave civilians, police personnel and security forces.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is spread throughout the world today, every day something happens, it happens in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our fathers have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, when India talked about extremism at the world stage, when it was highlighted by the terror of terrorism, many people in the world did not take it seriously, but today, when extremism hinders the country's doors, the world governments see terrorism as a big challenge.
This is aimed at destroying human powers.
Therefore, not only India, but all human forces in the world must unite and defeat extremism.
This is the soil of Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhians who have given this soil to the world of non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken our social system and make it post-child.
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to be with human powerful awareness.
My dear countrymen, on December 4, we will celebrate Navy Day.
The Indian Navy protects our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture has emerged on the banks of the river.
Whether Sindhu river or Ganga or Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important in both ways of economic and warfare.
This is our entrance to the whole world.
Their navy contributed to the expansion of the Empire and making it an economic giant.
Several examples of naval invasions and research journeys of the naval invasions of the naval forces are present in Sangha literature even today.
Most of the world's navies have been allowed to fight for a long time.
However, about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the Navy of the Armed Forces.
Women were also engaged in war.
The Governance of Egypt had fine technologies related to shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, could not President Shivaji Maharaj speak about the opening of his navy
The coastal Konkan coasts of the country were dominated by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts related to the empire of Sivaji Maharaj, Sindhu Durgak, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Durga etc. were situated on the coasts or surrounded by the sea.
The Marathi army is responsible for the safety of these forts.
Large ships and small ships were included in the Marathi navy.
His navy was capable of attacking and defending any enemy.
Can't Kanoji speak about the Marathi Navy and talk about Angrey
He took the Marathi navy to a new height, established the Marathi naval bases at many places.
Sumitra, immediately engaged in rescue operations, saved many fishermen from drowning and handed them over to Bangladesh.
During the floods in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our ships immediately arrived there and provided relief to the government and the people of the country.
In June, when the government of Papua New Guinea sent us an urgent assistance, our navy helped in protecting fishermen from their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud of the country, whether Fiji brings medical aid to the country or provides immediate relief to the neighbouring countries, and brings humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries.
We have always brought respect, respect and pride to our defence forces, be it the ground, be it our navy or the air force, the valour, courage, courage, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
125 crore Indians have lived a peaceful life, because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year, on December 7, we obey the flag of the military forces.
Throughout this week, they will lay the flag on all those who are small and big.
A campaign to respect the soldiers in the country will be promoted.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flags of our military forces.
The fund is spent through the welfare of the soldiers for the welfare of the families of the martyrs of the war, for the welfare of the injured and their rehabilitation.
You will be able to know about various ways of economic participation.
Let us use this opportunity and work towards increasing the morale of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on December 5th, World Soil Day.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters some things.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food storage is connected to the soil.
Just imagine what if this rich soil is not in the world required to produce.
Trees do not sprinkle trees, how can human life be possible
How will the intelligence be
The farmers of this country are giving great importance to their lives for two things such as devotion to the soil and scientific preservation.
It is a matter of great pride for us that while our country's farmers are connected to traditions, the country is on modern science, the country is on its own, the country is trying, the people are conscious.
When I went to Boranj area of Dohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I heard about the farmers there.
The farmers here have been using chemical fertilizers in the past, which has affected soil resources.
The production capacity of soil gradually decreased and earnings gradually decreased.
In 2016-17, the cultivation of winter crops increased by 3 to 4 times in every acre and income from every acre increased by 4 to 6 thousand rupees.
Not only this, the quality of soil has also improved.
Due to lack of fertilizer consumption, economically savings were also there.
It gives me great pleasure that my farmer brothers and sisters have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the soil resource card and seeing the outcome results, their enthusiasm increases.
The farmer brothers have started to understand that if we have to pay attention to the collection, if we first take care of the land, if we take care of the earth, then the mother of this land will take care of us all.
Our farmers across the country have more than 10 crore soil resource cards, so that they can easily know their land and seeds.
We bow down to Mother Earth, but have you ever thought of how much harm it is due to fertilizers like urea on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a greater impact on the earth's massive urea.
How can the farmer bear sufficient sufficient sufficient sufficient sufficient sufficiency when the mother of the earth becomes sick
It is essential for the time that we have to make this mother-in-law aware once again.
Can we ensure that our farmers, our mother-in-law, our mother-in-law, our mother-in-law, our mother-in-law, our mother-in-law and our mother-in-law will be able to reduce the urea that they use in half of the year 2022 when they are 75 years of independence
We all have started to experience global warming and climate change.
Before Deepawali, there was a time for the start of a cold poem.
But even in such circumstances, some examples inspire those who are awakened for ever and ever.
Tushar, an eight-year-old girl from Madhya Pradesh, has tried to free her villagers from open defecation.
This 8-year-old boy cannot speak, but he has the weapon of surviving
He woke up at 5 a.m. and went to his village's house, and put it in a pitch, and raised them, and made it through signals that they should not waste water in the open.
Because of this child who has given education of cleanliness to 30-40 households every day, Kumhari village was freed from the habit of open defecation.
In order to promote cleanliness, this little child is engaged in the task of inspiring Dushar.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness, there is no limit for cleanliness.
It is important for all, whether small or big or women, whether cleanliness is important, everyone must contribute to cleanliness.
You must have remembered that our talented sportspersons have won four medals by playing the best in the Rio Olympics and have won the T-20 World Cricket competition for the blind.
Various competitions are being held across the country.
In the past, the 17th National Park Water Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young disabled brothers and sisters from different parts of the country have participated in this and expressed their capabilities.
One of them is the 19-year-old Jigar Taker of Gujarat, who does not have 80 of his body, but look at his adventure, mind and hard work.
As a result of his talent, as one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected by the Sports Commission of India for 20-20 Parallimbics, he will now be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute the young igar Ducker and wish my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being paid to the accessibility and opportunities for the disabled.
A few days later, the day of Eit-e-Milad-Un-Nabi is being celebrated.
This day was the birth of Ambassador Hazrat Mohammad Saheb.
Prime Minister, I speak from Kanpur to Nirja Singh.
I appeal to you to share ten best things with us again from the words of Mann Ki Baat all over this year.
Is not there a great man in our villages, and they shall always forget mourning, and not forgot peace.
Over the years, we look at the past, we are engaged in the analysis of the ideas, following the results of which we are making plans for the next year.
We are trying to remind us of the interesting events of last year in the media.
This includes a positive thing and a negative thing.
But in 2018, when we have stepped up, we cannot remember what is good, we cannot remember what is good, we cannot remember.
I would like to give you a suggestion - if you share 5-10 positive things that you heard, see and experienced, then there would be no good feeling.
Can you be able to contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences in our life this time
We invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a comfortable environment and welcome it with good memories.
We will remember the events that inspire others.
We will recall the good things and create a good environment.
Good things provide the necessary strength to do good.
Let us combine the strength and impact of this joint drive.
In the voice of my next Mann Ki Baat, I will surely be involved in this effort to bring these things to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat, I will come again with you.
There will be an opportunity to exchange many things.
The sacred day of Sat Puja, which is celebrated six days after the end of Deepawali, is one of the festivals celebrated with many appointments and rules.
Traditional appointments are followed in every matter what to eat and what to do.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also bound up in this festival.
The entire house is cleaned before the Chatpuja, along with the cleanliness of rivers, lakes, watersheds, pilgrimages, pilgrimages and pilgrimages.
Sun Puja or Sat-Puja is a festival of recognition of environmental protection, disease relief and regulation.
The feeling of destroying salvation is behind this tradition that seeks prasad and this evil culture can be a major hindrance in progress.
It is a natural thing that this great tradition of India is proud of everyone.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is praised and praised.
Let's take a glimpse of carpets and handicrafts.
As soon as we hear that there is so much sale in a shop, there is joy in mind and happiness.
Approximately 680 growth has been registered in Khadi Prize sales on Deepawali.
The total sales of Khadi and Handicrafts have increased by about 90 percent.
Today, it shows that youngsters, elderly people, women and all the aged people want to wear carpets and handlooms.
I can imagine how many weaving families, the poor families and the families of those who work in handloom.
You must share my experience of Deepawali among the security forces and tell me how they celebrate the festival of Deepawali.
You all have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
For me this time, Deepawali has brought a great experience.
Once again we got a message to celebrate Deepawali with our ignorant security forces on the border.
This time, it was an unforgettable experience to celebrate Deepawali with the security forces in the Kurej area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all our security forces from all sides of the country for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces are confronting the extremely difficult and difficult situations on the borders.
Whenever we have the opportunity, whenever we have the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventures.
Many of us cannot know that our security forces are not only in our border areas but also in many important works to maintain peace throughout the world.
As a Peace Protector, they are proud of India all over the world.
For us, we are following the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, one family all over the world.
India has always been pressurizing women's equality and the U.
It may be a small change in Paraka, above all, but it reflects a subtle idea.
In the context of the various tasks of India, if we say that India has a great contribution, then it will be an ICFI.
India has always played a positive role in the UN peacekeeping operations.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served around 50 operations in 71 peacekeeping operations across the world.
These operations are being carried out in all parts of the world in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, India's military has provided treatment to more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Many people would have known that India is the first country to send the first female police force through the United Nations peacekeeping movement in Liberia.
This process of India is a matter of conception for all the countries of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
It is a matter of pride for all that Indias contribution is not only with peacekeeping activities but it is also a matter of pride that India is engaged in training those who work for peacekeeping of nearly 85 countries.
Our immense peacekeepers from this land of Gandhians and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peaceful actions are not simple.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
It has to live among different people.
There is a need to understand a variety of circumstances and different cultures.
We have to change ourselves according to regional issues and environments.
When we look at him, the hearts of all the people of the country glorify and the only ICT awarded the Paramveer Chakra Award.
In 1989, he was appointed as Force Commander for Operations in Namibia, a 72-year-old man, who dedicated his services to ensure Namibia's independence.
India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world as an ambassador to peace.
While he was born as Market Elizabeth in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him 'Nivedita'.
It means Nivedita is completely dedicated.
In the following times, he dedicated himself according to his name.
Yesterday, sister Nivedita's 150th birth anniversary.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was mentally impressed with the injustice done by the British rule.
The British did not only slave our country but also tried to keep us slaves in mind.
The work of degrading our culture and degrading our minds continues.
Sister Nivedita re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He was engaged in creating awareness of the country and uniting the people.
He went to different countries of the world and gave a voice against the wrong campaigns of Sanathan Dharma and Philosophy.
Revolution of renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati Innovation has explained in the poetry about the neo-painter and their arbitrary balance.
It is said that the inspiration for this story was received from his sister Nivedida.
Sister Nivedita has helped great scientist Jagdishchandra Poshu.
He has collaborated through his articles and conferences to publish and spread their studies.
To complete one spiritual and science is one of the most beautiful features of India.
Sister Nivedita and scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose have a special example of this.
In 1899, there was a terrible Black Disease in Kolkata, in which tens of thousands died.
Sister Nivedita started the work of cleaning the canals and streets, not taking care of her health.
He might have lived in a comfort but he was engaged in the service of the poor.
Inspired by his sacrifice, he started making his contributions in the service of the people.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
I am surprising when I heard that children also get diabetes.
In the past, such diseases are called royalty, meaning royalty is that such diseases are rich and only those who live well-being.
Such diseases were rarely visible to the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today we know these diseases as a lifestyle problem.
One of the major reasons for this disease in young age is the reduction in physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is also important to focus on social and family.
If you think of these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
Our old habits should be changed slightly and small things should be done properly and we should naturally make it possible.
Children should be in the habit of playing in open fields and the family members should be made aware.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these children in sports.
Instead of using lip-type, children can become a habit of climbing stairs.
Everybody in the family after dinner can walk with children.
Yoga is particularly beneficial for our young friends to create a healthy lifestyle and avoid lifestyle problems.
Before starting the school, you will find out how much you will get to do yoga for the first 30 minutes.
If I say it is easy, it can be learned easily, why it is very easy, it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for specific tools or fields for this.
Yoga is very beneficial to control diabetes, and many researches have been done on this.
This is undergoing a study at AIIMS (AIMS), which is very inspiring to see the decisions taken so far.
We will not see Ayurveda and Yoga as medicinal medicines, but make them part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the sports sector in the last few days.
After decades, we have been able to succeed in Asian Cup because our soldiers have played excellently.
Earlier, India won the Asian Cup in 2003 and 2007.
Congratulations to the entire team and the helpers on my side and the people's side.
After hockey, India has also suffered a good loss in badminton sports.
Bedminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the Denmark Open and made India proud.
This is the third Super Series Premiere victory after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to our young sportspersons for their achievement and pride for India.
Friends, This month FIFA started World Cup competitions for those under 17 years of age.
The teams from all over the world came to India and everyone showed their capabilities in the footwear field.
I got a chance to see a lamp.
Sportspersons and audiences were enthusiastic.
The whole world is taking care of the great event of World Cup.
And when we saw such a big throat, the strength of all the youngsters, the zeal and the thirst to achieve, the destruction was high.
The World Cup started successfully and all the teams showed their capabilities excellently.
Though India might have been unable to win, young sportspersons of India have won the hearts of everyone.
All over the world, including India, enjoyed this grand festival, attracted and enjoyed the fans of the surrounding football.
The symptoms of the future of the footwear are very bright.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons, to all those who have helped them, to all the sports fans.
My dear countrymen, whenever I see the number of writers about Swachh Bharat then I will have to give everyday Mann Ki Baat programme and I will have to dedicate the voice of every Mann Ki Baat to cleanliness.
Some send photographs on the efforts of small labourers and some send information about the efforts of the youth.
In some places some innovation related to cleanliness is being created or the changes made by some officer's efforts are being reported.
I was given a detailed statement about a revival story in the Chandrapur fort of Maharashtra in the past.
There, a non-governmental organisation named Ecological Protection Organisation was engaged in cleaning the fort of Chandrapur through its entire team.
The campaign that took place for 200 days, without comfort, without comfort, was engaged in the task of cleaning the fort.
Continuously 200 days.
Your disappointment will turn into confidence as soon as you see this.
This participant's efforts for cleanliness are a wonderful example of beauty, social activity and interim efforts.
The fort is a symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of preserving the historical heritage and hygiene is for the people of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the Ecological Protection Organization and their entire wear and Chandrapur citizens.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji was not only the first Guru of Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He reflected on the interests of the entire human society, and he served all castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message of equality in society, not just stopping his message with words, but also in his action.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has given three messages to live a life of benefits - to commemorate the name of God, to work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji passed a sacred book 'Guru Grand' to teach his teachings.
We will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the coming 2019.
Let us take the lead in his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, 2 days later, on October 31, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Ji's birth anniversary will be celebrated.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only a reflection of the idea of transformation, he was capable of implementing it and erupting it as a very difficult problem, but was able to solve it.
He was a specialist in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji took the responsibility of connecting India with the same fashion.
He made sure that crores of nations should be brought under the umbrella of the same Constitution.
His ability to resolve gave him the power to cross all the obstacles.
This word of Sardar ji is still a concept of our dream of a New India and is still relevant to today.
That is why we follow his birth anniversary as the National Integration Day.
His contribution in providing an integrated form to the nation is unparalleled.
On Sardar ji's birth anniversary, on 31st October, a programme of unity is being organized across the country, in which many people from all over the country are participating as children, youth, women and adults.
I urge you to participate in this run for unity and join the celebration of mutual harmony.
My heartfelt countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, with a new determination, with a new determination, you all have started resuming your daily life.
Congratulations to all of you for fulfilling your dreams.
Three years have been completed after talking to you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat in Akashwani.
Today, it is 36th.
In a way, the creative power of India, the feelings, aspirations and aspirations filled with every corner of the country are accusations at some places. However, Mann Ki Baat has given me a wonderful opportunity to connect with the feelings of the people.
You must have noticed that I have never said this as the voice of my mind.
Whether it is Electric, Phone, MyGov, NarendraModiApp, all these are available to me for your sending information.
Sometimes, individual related disorders, sometimes social problems etc. are attractive.
Once a month, I take about half an hour for you, but people, for 30 days a month, I have been sending information about the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I am grateful to the people of the country for getting the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have always been reminded of the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Thereafter, I have received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country, many social institutions and many youngsters have been engaged in the work of wasting food.
While watching, Selfie has transformed not only into India but also with daughters from all over the world into a big movement.
This is not a problem of social media.
Every girl child has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
It seemed that every mother had to take a self with her daughter.
Every woman has the feeling that she has the importance of her own.
In the past, I participated in a meeting of the tourism department of the Government of India.
Wherever you are traveling, I urge those travellers to send me photographs of surprising India.
Millions of films have come from every corner of India, in a way it has become a huge asset for those working in the tourism sector.
Every moment is at a pace to travel on the right path of the country.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something constructively for the welfare of others, for the benefit of society and for the progress of the country.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I learnt from the people of the country, understood and learned.
This is a big capital and a great power for any country.
Selling of cashews has increased due to which employment has increased in the houses of the poor.
Since 2nd October, a substantial withdrawal has been made in the letters, which is substantially substantial.
Once again, I would like to urge you to take forward the movement related to trash and strengthen it further.
We have to bear the feeling of lighting the lamps of Deepawali in the houses of the poor when we buy trails.
This process gives strength to the poor of our country, for this we must do it.
Increasing interest in trading has resulted in new thinking and incentives in the field of trading and those associated with trading in the Government of India.
How to absorb new technologies, how to enhance productivity and how to introduce solar equipment.
They have started imagining how to revive the tradition that has been concealed for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, in Sevapur, Varanasi, the Sevapuri Gadhi Ashram has been closed for 26 years, which has now started working with new Tempera.
That is, 15 days before the 2nd October of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we decided to celebrate Swachhta Celebrations across the country.
Let us unite the minds of the people through cleanliness.
Our Honble President inaugurated this work and the nation was united in it.
Today, the elderly, the boys, the men and the city-village are connecting themselves as part of this cleanliness mission.
I had said that this cleanliness drive is moving forward in the direction of success with the help of our determination and is spreading in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it suitable for them, helping them and contributing to accomplishing it.
Sportspersons, cinematographers, academics, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, personnel, police personnel and soldiers are all associated with this mission.
There is a kind of pressure that people ask layers for cleanliness in the public places and those who work there should be hygiene and I feel that it is a good thing.
This time I had to pay attention to another thing - cleaning is one thing, and we are not cleaning from awakening
At the same time, Swachhta is our natural transformation and it is important to implement an idea movement.
This time there have been several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than 12 crore children participated in the essay competition.
Thousands of children took their imagination capabilities and painted them.
When we talk about cleanliness, I do not forget to thank the media persons.
They have taken this movement forward with a very clean spirit.
They have contributed to a positive environment by connecting them with them in a suitable manner.
We can see how much the e-media and newspapers of our country are serving the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, one of the 18-year-old youth from Srinagar told me about Bilal Dar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, in which he was excluding plastic, polythene, used bottles and dustbins.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father died due to cancer, he joined his livelihood with cleanliness.
Bilal Dar is a young man, and is an inspiration and a factor for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a remembrance of many of our great men.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh in October, the birth anniversary of 25th September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji.
This year, Nanaji and Deendayal have been centuries.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji surpassed his political life and connected himself with the Gramodaya movement and on this occasion of his centenary, it is important that we respect him for his work in rural areas.
When the former President of India, Abdul Kalam ji speaks to the youth, he will always present things about Nanaji Deshmukh ji's rural progress.
He also visited the villages to see Nanaji's work with great respect.
Like the Gandhians, Deendayal Upadhyay Ji will also speak in detail about the man in the background of society.
Deendayal will remember how to make a change in education and employment in the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the deprived and the deprived.
If we think of all these human beings, not the instrument that we can do to them, why do we think of these human beings, then when we think that the way we have to go ahead, the way goes ahead.
There should be a massive drive for unity in every city of the country and the weather is comfortable according to it and it is necessary to get iron like Sardar ji.
Sardar ji did not unite the country
We also have to participate in this movement for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We are naturally saying that unity in diversity is achieving India.
While we are proud of diversity, are you trying to experience this diversity
I would like to tell the people of the country, especially the younger generation that we are alive.
And enjoy the diversity of our India, feel it and enhance its smell.
You can see that this diversity of our country will become a school for the development of the uniqueness within you.
Holidays, Deepavalis, the mindset of going around our country and somewhere.
People from North India don't know what is in South India.
People living in the West don't know what is in East India.
Do you know how much diversity is there in our country
If you have seen the speeches of Gandhians, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam, then one thing will be very good that when they visit India, they have got a new inspiration to see, understand and dedicate their lives to India.
All these dignitaries have visited India completely.
Before their operations, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India living within themselves.
Cannot our different states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their patterns, their food habits and their beliefs be learned as a student
It is the value of tourism that we are not able to go and stop and understand as a student.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food is there
If you have every kind of food every day in your life, you will not be able to eat the same food again.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
In these holidays, you have to leave the house and not go for change but go out with the aim of knowing things and understanding things.
Your life will be completed through these experiences.
Your vision will be analyzed.
Who can be bigger than your experiences, tell me
If you go this time, you will have taken this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photos.
Definitely send your photographs to incredibleia.
If you have to meet the people there, send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind that in order to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations in your state - every Indian should know about those seven places of your state, if possible, to go to those seven places.
With the help of this, can you provide any information about this
Can you express it on the NarendraModiApp
Can you know this in Incredible India
If many people from one state say this then I would like to tell the government to discuss the advertising cards of which 7 places have been mentioned in every state in general.
That is, in a way, how can we take the tourist destinations forward with the opinion of the people
Likewise, you can imagine that the places you have seen in the country, the places you have seen in the most important 7 places, the others have to visit here and get information about these things and you must send them to MyGov and NarendraModiApp.
Come on, join me.
During the period from October to March, you can become a sympathetic to encourage the tourism sector of the country.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a man, many things touch my heart.
I'm a man like you too
The event that took place in the past, perhaps it might have come to your attention - the countrymen would have seen a wonderful example of women's power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has received two heroes - Lieutenant Instruction and Financial Funds, which are extraordinary heroes.
If I say why extraordinary people have lost their lives in the service of Mother India, the husbands of both Swati and Finance.
You can imagine how they will be psychological.
But the martyr, Col. Santosh Mahadik's wife, Sudhi Mahadik, faced such a difficult situation and strengthened her mind and joined the Indian army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army and worked to realize his husband's dream.
Likewise, Financial Tubey's husband, Mahesh Dubey, worked as a hero in the army, succumbed to his wife's finance and joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen will be respected for this mother's power and our heroes.
My dear countrymen, during the Navratri festival and Deepawali, the youngsters of our country have got a great opportunity.
FIFA is scheduled to be a World Cup for those under 17 years of age.
I am confident that there will be a reflection of the footsteps on all four sides.
Every generation will be interested in footwear.
Everyone should be involved in this sports that there are no youngsters who have not played football in any school and college field of India.
Let us make sports a part of our lives when all the world is playing on Indian soil.
My dear countrymen, Navratri is going on.
This is the time to worship Mother Durga.
The atmosphere is spread with the whole sacred fragrance.
There is a spiritual environment, an atmosphere of festival and devotion all around
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I convey my best wishes to the people of the country, I urge my mother Barashakti to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country and to take new heights.
The country has to get the opportunity to face every challenge.
The country should move forward at a rapid pace, when India is 75 years of independence in 2022, the efforts to fulfill the dreams of those who are thirsty, the satisfaction of the 125 crore people, the untimely hard work, the unbearable energy and the mindset, we should move forward with the five-year plans for New India and the mother's supreme blessings.
My best wishes to all of you.
Engage in the festivals, spread the cluster.
This country, the birthplace of Buddha and Gandhi, was the land of Sardar Patel, who was born with complete dedication for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have been prideful of the common life values and of non-violence and are filled in our minds.
Ahimsa Parmodharma: - We have heard this word from our childhood and have come here.
This diversity is not found only in food habits, residential habits and dressing clothes
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been organised according to the schedule of nature.
All these are directly connected to nature.
Many of our festivals are related to farmers and fishermen.
When I talk to you today about the festivals, I would like to say Michami to all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari Festival yesterday.
The festival of Parushan is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
On the last day of the festivals, Samvatsari is coming.
This is a wonderful tradition.
Samavatsari's day refers to forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
This festival is a symbol of time, unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the people of the country, Babyar Chaturthi.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
Kerala's Oan is one of the most important festivals in the colorful festivals of India.
Nowadays our festivals are the factors of tourism attraction.
I would like to tell the countrymen that it is a festival of Navratri in Gujarat and a festival of Durga in Bengal that has become a tourist attraction in a way.
Our other festivals have also created an opportunity to attract neighbours.
In this direction we should think of what else we can do.
Idul Suha will be coming to the festival in a few days.
At the same time, in New India, festivals should be the factor of cleanliness.
Festivals and cleanliness are linked to family life.
Preparation for the festival is to focus on cleanliness and sanitation.
This is not a new thing to us, but it is important to change it into a social nature.
They apply colors in them, one blossoms green color, one puts a paper piece in it.
Every family is making various uses.
In a way, this is the first time that this Ganesh Festival has been witnessed by the greatest training of environmental awareness.
Three years ago, we started the Swachhta Mission and will complete three years from 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
The toilets have reached 39 percent to about 67 percent.
An excellent example of hygiene and unity has been shown by the people of Jamiat Ulema A Hindu organisation as an example of inspiration for all.
And if our efforts are made with dedication to cleanliness, if our permanent nature changes, then our country cannot achieve any peak
Whenever we get the opportunity, where we get the opportunity.
But we all have to join it.
We consider it a kind of preparation before Deepawali or the preparation for the Navratri or the preparation for the Durga Puja.
Let us do physical service.
We will work together on holidays or on Sundays.
We will go to the neighbouring habitations, to the nearby villages, but we can do this as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental institutions, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district rulers and Panchayat leaders - 15 days before the 2nd October of the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we should create an environment related to cleanliness, it is indeed a October 2 that the Gandhians dreamt of.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After the construction of a toilet, you can register your name and the name of those whom you have helped to build a toilet.
My social workforce friends can foster some positive movements, you can think of ensuring work on the platform.
The seminar on Swachhta Victory will be organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation through the commitment to Swachhta, Essay Competition, Small Making Competition and Picture Ceremony.
In this, you can write in many languages, there is no age.
You can manufacture a small film and make it on your mobile phone.
2-3 minute short films should be made and it should be inspiring for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this movement related to cleanliness.
After this 15-day Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, when we celebrate the 2nd of October, see how clean will we enjoy when we are present to the devoted Gandhians.
Millions of people write letters, provide information, many people are giving news through phones, this is a big wealth platform for me.
This is a great opportunity to understand the minds of the people of the country.
More than you wait for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I wait for your messages.
I am thirsty because every thing of you gives me an opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I too have made such a mistake.
Sometimes some things change us naturally, we don't even fault.
Prime Minister, I speak from Pune to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She's always trying to help everyone, but her action makes me feel disappointed.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
He spent 2000 rupees without any difficulty to buy a luggage, and then spent Rs 450 and bought a beat.
But with the auto driver used to come to the campus, he was seriously involved in a deal of Rs 5.
When he bought vegetables on the way back, he talked about a deal at every vegetable price and saved 4-5 rupees.
I'm very difficult.
We buy things without any question in big places, we fight for retail money to our brothers and sisters who are working hard.
After asking for this phone call, I am sure that you might have been disappointed and you might have ensured that I will not be able to walk anymore.
Have you ever thought of what will run in the minds of the poor
My young friends, on August 29, the entire country is celebrating the sports day.
This is the birth anniversary of the hockey sportsperson and the hockey sportsperson of the world.
His contribution to Hockey is incomplete.
I remember this thing because the youth of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become part of our lives.
As we are a young country in the world, we must reflect in these young sports fields.
Sports provide sports, awakening mind and governance development - what else to say.
The sports are a humor that connects the minds in a way.
I would like to note that the younger generation of our country must move forward in the sports world and that is important in todays computation world, the sports field is more important than the computer sports equipment.
FIFA footsteps can play everything on the computer, but I can see the footsteps on the ground.
You can play cricket on the computer, but play under the sky in the field, its enjoyment is unlikely.
When all the children go out of the house at a time, when will the mother return
It has changed in today's time, children are sitting in one corner and start watching cartoon films or drowning in mobile cameras as soon as they come home.
Anybody in the field of sports, whoever child in the country is capable of sports, they can handle their details or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will train selected and developing sports sportspersons and start this portal tomorrow.
In India, FIFA is organising a World Foot Cup for those under 17 years of age from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from all over the world will come and play in India.
Let us welcome the young social guests from many countries through sports festivals, let us enjoy sports and create such an environment in the country.
While talking about sports, I would like to share with you about the event that touched my heart in the past weeks.
Six such women are working in the Navy.
Their feelings and their inspiration are inspiring all of us.
These six women are also traveling in a small boat INS TARINI and are trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
They will go around the world and return to India after several months.
Sometimes you spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes it may have to be spent in water for about 30 days.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six women travel with adventure and this is the first time in the world.
I am also organising a special way for their experiences in the NarendraModi App and reading you.
You must read it because I am very happy to share with you the experiences of these women's wealth, the story of this kind of courageous story, self-experience.
My heartfelt greetings and best wishes to these women.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we celebrate the Teachers' Day.
The former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he preferred himself all his life.
He always wanted to live a fool.
He was dedicated to education.
As an advocacy, as a kingdom, as the President of India, he was a survivor of every moment.
I remember him.
This time, when we celebrate Teachers' Day, can we all make a commitment together
Due to his efforts, the events that have been successful in transforming the lives of every teacher will definitely be in the lives of every teacher.
If we make social efforts, we can make a transformation in the country, we can play a bigger role in it.
Let us learn to change, let us take this mantra forward, let us learn.
Ananya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As an analyst, I have a great interest in financial inclusion, financial inclusion and related social programmes.
I would like to ask you that in 2014, when you started Jan Dhan Yojana, in the last three years, if India is financially safer, if energy is increasing, whether this power expansion and facilities have reached our women, farmers, workers, villages and pockets, what to tell the statistics
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been heard and financial inclusion is a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the economic world.
On August 28, 2014, I started this scheme with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Prime Minister's Jan Dhan Yojana will complete three years.
30 crore new families have been connected to this and bank accounts have been opened.
This is the largest number of countries in the world.
Sometimes, if money is suffocated in the hands, if it is in the bag or in the house, it will inspire the mind to spend waste.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the money collected by our poor is Rs. 65,000 crore.
In a way, this savings of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Those who have opened bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will get insurance benefits.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - a simple fee of Rs. 1, 30, today a new confidence has been created in the lives of those poor.
If there is a problem for the poor, if a family leader dies due to a fee of Rs. 2 lakhs in many families.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, such a scheme, be it the underprivileged, the tribals, the graduates, the graduates, the youngsters, the youngsters who are standing on their own feet, crores of such youth have been able to get money without any bondage from the banks.
They are not only standing on their own feet, but also in successful efforts to provide employment to one or two people.
In the last few days when some people from the banking sector came to meet me, they said that they have got a lot of inspiring things that have benefitted the common man due to Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will take all the efforts to bring them to your sight
Even media persons include events that can be fully utilized.
They can also interact with such persons and create new ideas for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again the greetings of Michami for all of you.
English rendering of PMs address at Indian Radio today morning
The rainy season becomes a time for people to take away their minds.
Animals, birds, plants and nature all flourish with the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when this rain becomes heavy, we know how much the water has the power to destroy it.
Nature is the mother of nature who gives us life, grows all of us, but sometimes the natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes and their critical forms are more ruined.
Changing climate and environmental change have adversely affected.
Over the past few days, some parts of India, especially in Assam, Northeast, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, had to face natural calamities due to heavy rainfall.
Comprehensive surveillance measures are being taken in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making great efforts to help people affected by floods in their own way.
Even social organisations, cultural organisations and civilians who are serving are making their best efforts to bring help to the people in this situation.
Farming, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In order to compensate the losses faced by our farmer brothers and their crops, we have undertaken schemes to ensure that the farmers' compensation demand is resolved quickly, especially to the insurance companies, especially the crop insurance companies.
Besides, 1078 is also fully operational for 24 hours to deal with floods.
People are expressing their problems in this sense.
Prior to the start of the rainy season, the entire government machinery was set up in the process of conducting training operations at most places.
National Disaster Rescue Force teams were covered.
They were trained to set up a Disaster Help Enterprises Organisation at many places, to decide the volunteers, to create a public body and to act in such circumstances.
Nowadays, the weather has already been observed, technology has grown, space science has played a major role in estimating it, and that is why we have almost got the right calculation.
Gradually, according to the climate calculation, we have to transform our activities and protect ourselves from disaster prone impact.
Whenever I prepare for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see the people of our country engaged themselves in the manufacturing work.
This time there have been several letters and phone calls regarding GST.
Even today people have expressed their happiness and hopes for this goods and service tax.
I would like to hear this phone call: Greetings, Prime Minister, I am speaking from Gurgaon i.e. from Gurugram to Karg.
When a month has passed, are you expected to have the results
I would like to know your thoughts in this regard, thank you.
The Goods and Services Tax has been implemented for nearly a month and the results have started to be known.
I see how this new infrastructure has affected the transport and services sector.
Goods are also reaching very fast.
Despite this facility, it has added strength especially to the economic pace.
Due to the first separate tax structure, the majority of the transport and service sectors had spent on maintaining the documents and had to create new dwellings for themselves in every state.
I say Goods and Services Tax - Goods and Simple Tax, this tax has actually had a very positive impact on our economic system in a very short span of time.
The speed at which there has been a balanced change, the speed at which new innovations have been made, new records have been registered, all these have created a new confidence in the entire country.
In many of the world universities, it will become a model research.
Because such a huge transformation, with the participation of crores of people, the successful implementation of this system in such a big country can be considered as a top success.
S.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All the decisions have been taken together by the States in an unanimous manner.
What was the price of a commodity specified by the App before this regime and what was after the new regime, everything is available in your mobile phones.
This is a historical victory and historical achievement.
This is also a social reform movement in a way.
I salute crores of people and crores of people who have made such a great effort very naturally.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is a symbol of revolution.
Naturally, we have already heard about this thing before the childhood and this is the reason why the Cooperation Movement was launched on 1st August, 1920.
Then, on 9th August, 1942, the uit India Movement started, we know it as the August Revolution
Later, on August 15, 1947, the country was liberated.
In a way, several events of August have been specially linked to the history of independence.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, Dr. Harsh Vardhan proposed the urge to get out of India.
Some people know that Yusuf Mehr Ali is.
Our new generations must know what happened on the 9th of August 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, all the historical aspects that the people of the country joined themselves with the zeal of freedom, binded themselves and tolerated evils must inspire us to build a great India.
What can be more conceptual than the sacrifices, penance and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is a very important struggle for the freedom movement.
This struggle made the entire country a solemn pledge to get rid of the British rule.
At that time, against the British regime, in every corner of Hindustan, villages, cities, educated, uneducated, poor and rich, all joined shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to shoulder, and participated in the freedom struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the top.
Hundreds of thousands of people listened to the challenges of the Gandhians and took forward the struggle in the country and in the minds of Chetumadi.
Millions of youngsters of the country have sacrificed their teachings and books in the freedom movement.
The Sangnatha of independence was shouted and they went ahead.
Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan have played a leading role.
The Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942, showcasing two different aspects of Gandhians.
The variety of cooperation is different and the quest for independence in 1942 had to put forward the mantra of a mantra like Gandhians, karna or slaughter.
The freedom struggle that started in 1857 has continued every moment in some part of the country till 1942.
This long-standing period had created an independent desire in the heart of the people of the country.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no laziness in satisfaction.
People were constantly coming, engaged, went, new people came, they joined themselves, they were trying to break the British regime and calculate in the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle created a new position and took this position to the height of 1942.
Then Sangnatha shouted out of India and within five years the British had to leave the country in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the independence candidate reached all the people.
These five years, from 1942 to 1947, were a result of the liberty of the country, which had been reflected in the spirit of the people.
This five years they have decided.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
In 1947 we got freedom.
Today, we are in 2017.
It took about 70 years.
Governments came to the forefront.
Organisations have emerged, changed, developed and developed.
Everyone has tried in their own ways to rescue the country from its problems.
Efforts have been made to generate employment, eradicate poverty and develop the country.
Efforts have been made in their own ways.
Success has also been achieved.
We have to celebrate the 15th of August this year as the 4th of the century and 75th year after independence in 2022, we have achieved the success of this incident.
125 crore people of the country remembering the Revolution Day on 9th August, on 15th August, as a person, as a person, as a citizen, I will do this for the country, as a family, as a society, I will do this as a city, as a government, I will do it as a government.
Millions of people have to make noise.
Efforts should be made to meet such incidents.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 have been determined to ensure the independence of the country, we have to do it together for the five years from 2017 to 2022.
We are celebrating 75 years after independence.
Every citizen, every social organisation, every local organisation, schools, colleges and various institutions, should take a pledge to create a New India.
May this be our commitment to succeed in the next five years.
What goal should we achieve as a nation
What can I contribute to it as a person
Use technology, take all the videos, posts, blocks, writings and new ideas.
Let us make this movement a mass movement.
In the Narendra Modi App, a competition for young social friends will be organized for the uit India uestion.
This question competition is an effort to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to know about the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message and spread it well.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country on 15th August.
I'm a tool.
I read them, I will try to show them how much time I have on August 15.
Accusations were made before me that the speeches I spoke on August 15 last three times were a little longer.
I'm trying to make rules for me, I don't know whether I can do it or not.
But I have the idea of trying this time to make my speech brief.
I can see if I have a success or not.
Friends, I would like to talk to you about another thing.
India's economic system has a socio-economy.
We should never calculate it.
Our festivals and our festivals are not just an opportunity to enjoy happiness.
Our festivals and celebrations are also a movement for social redevelopment.
Besides this, every festival of ours has a direct link to the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
A few days later, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then Babyar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Anant Chaturdasi, Durga Puja and Deepawali are coming together.
These link individuals and society.
The natural journey between the two continues.
An opportunity to move forward from the point of view of Ah Se i.e. from the point of view of me.
As an economic condition, even months before the festival of Raksha Bandhan, many families have started producing ropes as a small poultry industry.
Different types of rocks are being developed from cotton to paddy.
But today people have started to like the ropes that are being produced at home.
It has a direct link with the poor artisans who produce small lights.
But today, while talking about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them, I would like to make it clear about the environment.
Sometimes, I see the people of the country who are more aware and constructive than me.
Over the last one month, aware citizens have written to me letters about the environment.
You people have requested me to talk about the environment-friendly child before Babyar Chaturthi and that is why the desire for the children made on the soil can be increased from now on.
For the first time, I express my gratitude to such aware citizens.
At the same time, we should also be determined to create a climate-friendly, soil-made children, to protect the environment.
This time I have said a long time ago
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals and festivals.
A few days ago, our women and women have done a great job in the cricket world cup.
This week they got the opportunity to meet all of them.
It gave me great pleasure to interact with them, but I felt that they were pressing them that they could not win the World Cup.
The pressure on their faces, this crisis was poured.
I gave those women a distinct assessment on my side.
Look, today's age is a media world, the expectations have increased, the extent that the success has not been achieved, it becomes angry.
If India's sportspersons fail, then we have seen in many sports sports sportspersons in the country's anger.
Besides, these women lauded their achievements and were proud of them.
Indeed, the youngsters of our country, especially the women, are engaged in many things to make the country proud.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the younger generation, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country to new heights and take it to new heights.
Come on, let's travel together, let's get something done.
Let us move forward with the confidence that the future of the country will definitely be better.
My best wishes.
Climate is changing.
After the rains, cold winds have given a slight breath from summer heat in the past.
Whatever the places faced in life, however the crisis, in the personal life, in the public life, in the coming of rain, in the mindset of all of us, we feel that there is a good change in our mindset.
The poor of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath in a spiritual manner.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, there is a word called uggernout, which means an unprecedented chariot.
Whenever we look at Agaradi, the word 'Jagarnauth' has come to know that Jagannath's rath yatra has been created.
On seeing all these things, we can understand how the world has adopted this greatness in their own ways.
On the occasion of Lord Jagannath's visit, I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country and bow down to the serpentines of Lord Jagannath.
Come, let us all get inspired from these holy festivals and share the joy of happiness, let us move the country on the path of development.
In this auspicious month of Ramlan, we have noticed a very conception of the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters living with their families in this small village, in a way there are brothers and sisters of a large number of Islamic families.
In this month of Ramlan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
Therefore, you have said that you will spend this 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for transforming this auspicious occasion of Ramlan for social welfare.
We know that the States of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared Open Defecation Free States.
I express my special gratitude to the administration, rulers and the people of these five states.
We know that if we have to do something good in personal life or in social life then we should work hard for it.
If we think our signatures are bad, then we should try it for a long time to be very careful.
Only then will it become a habit of physical and mentality.
Similarly, some other bad habits are natural for us.
We must attract everybody's attention.
We must recall the inspirational events.
I am glad that today cleanliness has not stopped at the government level.
This has transformed into a movement of people's society.
This happened in the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is the target of this
Toilets will be constructed in 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats at 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, the public and the government have succeeded in the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
In) comes through letters and through Akashwani.
Prakash Tribhadi ji recalled the emergency and said that June 25 is the biggest concern in the history of democracy.
Prakash Tripadhi ji's awareness about democracy is commendable and democracy is not just an organisation but a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it is a dark night, no one can easily forget it.
Any Indian cannot leave it.
All the great leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned.
Today, the students of the media world, the people working in the form of democracy, have been engaged in a series of efforts to remind them of that bitter period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail during that period.
As an emergency was announced in the country, Atal ji wrote a poem and wrote in that poem the atmosphere in the country at that time.
We must make this tradition stronger.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian feels great pride by commemorating his head.
On June 21, 2017, the entire world is Yoga.
People from water to mountains welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Yoga was not before, but today everyone is associated with Yoga, Yoga is a bridge that connects the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have converted this Yoga into an opportunity for you.
In Machu Pichu, the world heritage symbol of the big country, over 2400 metres above the sea level and over 4000 people from Abu Dabhi of the United Arab Emirates participated in yoga.
India-Afghan friend, Salma Dam in Herath, Afghanistan, has engaged in Yoga and has created a new fashion for friendship.
Even in small places like Singapore, 70 programmes were organised and they took this campaign for a week.
This time again Yoga has achieved a world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made Yoga and have achieved a new world record.
I got an opportunity to talk about Yoga in Lucknow.
But for the first time this is a good opportunity for yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers are also engaged in yoga art even in Siachen with minus 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Our army, the Border Security Forces, the Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, the Central Reserve Police Forces, the Central Industrial Security Forces, are all engaged in their duties and yoga training.
Since this is the third International Yoga Day, I had requested the family of three generations to take a picture of Yoga and share with me.
Some television channels also took this matter forward.
A lot of photographs have been sent to me and some of them have been selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am from Ahmedabad in Gujarat to Dr.
Anil Sonara speaks.
Sir, I recall that you have recently said in Kerala that instead of giving pomegranates, we can give good books to memories.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea across the country.
I liked it a lot.
I am reminded of a thing that escaped from my memory.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should not provide flowers anymore, we should give books or welcome, we have developed a way of giving a handkerchief and welcome.
We will also provide a carpet, because it will give a boost to the carpets.
This was a habit when I was in Gujarat, but after coming from there, this habit has gone away.
But when I went to Kerala, I had a awareness again.
But when we provide books, in a way it becomes part of the house and becomes a family member.
How many poor do we know how many helpful it can be given to us even if we give kids of kids
Decreasing costs are also being used properly.
These things have more historical importance.
When I went to Britain last year, the UK ueen Elizabeth Maiyar had invited me to honour in London.
He said in a loud voice that when he glittered a light in his eyes, when I was married, the Gandhians congratulated me and presented this handloom.
It has been ruined for years, but Elizabeth queen kept the handloom preserved by Gandhians.
A small gift of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits do not change night by night, and by speaking like this, criticisms are also prevailed.
At the same time, efforts should be made in such interactions.
For this, when I go somewhere, I don't deny that if someone brings a garlic, I can't do that.
Criticisms will rise, we must repeat, gradually there will be a change.
My dear countrymen, there are several functions as the Prime Minister of the country.
Even if I want to be drowned in the cups, I am making a habit, that is, I have a chance to connect me with the common people by reading something in my letters.
Several types of letters come and many people write letters to me.
I feel that it is important to share with you a letter I read a few days ago.
Therefore, I have started the work of getting money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and buying some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, I was focused on the Government of India e-Marketplace, Government e-Marketplace.
Whoever wants to give anything to the government - electric bulbs, dustbins, dresses, chairs and tables, they can register themselves on this platform.
And it is obliged that the government departments should go to this platform and buy goods on which they are selling at affordable prices and quality goods.
In this context, all the departments of the government are taking care of who are registering in e-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at affordable prices.
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
It has illumination, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I would like all those who want to sell their goods to the government, to register themselves on this portal at a higher level.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space science are also shining our hearts.
While our footsteps are on the soil connected with yoga, we are reflecting the dream of touching the journal that is far away.
In the past, India has achieved a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the earth but also on the planet.
Two days ago, ISRO has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with CartoSAT-2 satellites.
In addition to India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.
This Nano Satellite Mission of India will be of great help in obtaining information about agriculture and natural evils.
1000 days of passing is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Now we can see that our youngsters are making great progress in the sports sector.
Besides education, they understand their future in the sports sector.
The country is proud of our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements.
Recently, India's badminton sportsperson Kidambi Srikanth has won the Indonesia Open Games and made the country proud.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a major role in overall governance development.
There is no famine for talent in the country.
If our children are engaged in the sports sector in our family then we should give them the opportunity.
They should not be expelled from the plains, put in the room and insisted on reading.
Let him study and make his progress, but if he has greater talent and zeal in sports, let him inspire everybody to be in school, college, family and neighborhood.
Everyone must dream of participating in the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, it is a time for rainy season and festivals to create new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and join you in the voice of the next Mann Ki Baat.
This year the heat of summer is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time we are waiting for rain.
When I am talking to you today, the holy month of Ramlan has started.
On this auspicious month of Ramlan, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and all over the world, especially to the Islamic community.
In the month of Ramlan, prayer, spirituality and devotion have been given considerable importance.
It is a matter of pride to the 125 crore people of our country that all the religions in the world are in India.
We should be fortunate that our ancestors have established this great tradition.
There are faithful and faithful in God, there are deniers of God in this country, there are idol worshipers, those who oppose the idol worship, such a variety of people is full of idols.
The art of diverse ideals, diverse pilgrimages and diverse traditions has joined us.
Whether it is time, ways, philosophy, traditions, all these are the only message to us - peace, unity, harmony and harmony.
This holy month of Ramlan will help us to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you.
I am happy that a large number of people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone individually wants to share their experiences with me with enthusiasm.
"I speak with Deepak Kad.
I have decided to study in the holidays when I have almost been released from me.
When I started learning about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles that India had to achieve independence and how many struggles were being carried out by the martyrs of prison.
I would like to urge you to send a message to the generation of today about this thing, that is why the life of Bhagat Singh Ji, who has achieved the greatest achievement in a very young age.
I am glad that the youngsters are keen to know about our history, about our freedom fighters, about the physical, material and spiritual martyrs for this country.
Innumerable men have lost their young men in prisons.
Several youngsters have kissed the swords with face.
Today, we can breathe the breathing wind of independent India because of their unprecedented sorrow.
All the dignitaries who have spent their time in the freedom struggle, they have written books, read and done great work, their writings have also played a major role in securing India's independence.
Several years ago, I had visited the Cellular Jail in Andaman Nicobar.
Today Veer Savarkar ji's birthday.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book titled Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on the walls of prison.
They kept him locked in a small room.
Do you know what evils did the unliberated bear
Soon after I had read the book Maji Janmade written by Savarkar, the desire to see the Cellular Jail was raised in me.
They are organising an audio-like scene there, which is very inspiring.
Among those who sacrificed their youth in this Andaman Nicobar Prison, known as Kalabani, all the linguistics of India were from all the states and had suffered many sorrows.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, the first Monday of the month.
Well, what do you mean to connect with nature
For me, we are connected to us, we are connected to us.
Connectivity with nature is the creation of a great land.
Who can show it better than Gandhians.
Gandhijis once said: One must care about a world one will not see, we are interested in the unprecedented world that we cannot see, it is our duty to be interested in the unprecedented world.
You must have realized that the nature has the power to do so
Perhaps you might have been very tired and if you drive water and sprinkle it on your face then think of how you have got a freshness
The famines that have created our body are connected to the famines, the new energy emerges.
Therefore, on June 5, the world-class movement that connects with nature must be a movement to connect with us.
The Vedas have demonstrated the earth and the environment on the basis of energy.
Atharvan Veda gives us a complete guidance to the environment in a way, which is a thousand years old book.
: : - Mother Earth: Budro Ahm Pradivya: It is a case in our country.
It is said in the Vedas that the hygiene that we have had is due to the earth.
There are many festivals in our country, many rituals - the poor, the uneducated, the urban residents, the villagers, the tribal community, the natural worship and love for nature.
However, we need to understand it in contemporary words, in contemporary terms.
I have received a lot of news from the states.
A massive movement of tree plantation starts in almost all the states as soon as the rains arrive.
Crores of trees are being planted.
This time we also have to contribute more importantly and contribute to the planting of trees in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, June 21 is a day to know the world well.
All the world celebrates this as World Yoga Day.
On June 21, in a short span of time, the world is spread across the world as World Yoga Day, which connects the world.
On the one hand, when the separatist forces are showing their worst faces in the world, India's largest donor yoga art to the world.
Through yoga, we can connect the world to one another.
As Yoga connects the body, mind, intelligence and soul, Yoga can connect the world.
Today due to lifestyle, due to emergency, due to increasing responsibilities and stress, life has become bigger.
We see that this situation has occurred even in childhood.
Yoga will help us to live a life of stress-free life during the days of taking unprecedented medicines.
Approximately Yoga will guarantee both welfare and sex.
Yoga is not just exercise.
How to take a healthy inclusive journey from body, mind, thoughts and habits - if we want to experience such an inclusive journey then it is possible only through yoga.
Two days ago, on the occasion of Yoga tomorrow, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world.
Last year, I had announced some competitions and some prizes related to yoga.
Gradually work is progressing in this direction.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have given this basic advice.
This is a very interesting thing.
He has asked me to urge all three generations of the family to do yoga together on the 3rd International Yoga tomorrow.
Three generations like grandfather, parents and son-in-law can do yoga and give them the picture.
Yesterday, it will be a compassionate similarity as tomorrow and Yoga will have a new dimension.
Tomorrow, it will be a tomorrow film which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
Initiate training from today, as the International Day of Yoga remains for three weeks.
You also share Yoga related matters for your part, spread, connect people.
In a way, this is a pre-defensive healthcare campaign.
I invite you all to join this.
From that day onwards, I have visited various parts of India.
What did Modi do I have a very interesting look at some people.
An interesting phone call came to me, and I didn't think of what was said in it.
But I thank you for creating such a different approach.
I believe that this phone call will make you so.
"Modi Ji, I speak Naina from Mumbai.
I have often seen in television and social web sites that wherever you are going, the people of the state are paying much attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people are listening to your call and are taking home as a cleanliness movement in the society.
On the one hand, there has been awareness about cleanliness among the children.
Many times I have seen that the elders of their elders have been hampering the streets.
After you started the cleanliness campaign in the valleys of Kashi, it has become a formidable form of inspiration from you.
You are right to say, wherever I am going, wherever the government machinery is working for cleanliness, but now it is also being celebrated at the social level.
5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I leave, adequate cleaning work is going on.
Media also gives great importance to this thing and I had visited Kutch in Gujarat a few days ago.
There was a massive Swachhta Mission.
I didn't see it attached to it, but only after this phone call came to me, yeah, I argued that this thing was right.
It is a matter of great joy that all the other manufacturing muslims are going on to welcome the Prime Minister, but it is a matter of great happiness.
It is enjoyable for anyone who wishes cleanliness and conception.
I extend my warm greetings to all those who strengthen the cleanliness work.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's a funny advice.
I want to think about it. I want to think about it.
It is very important that a movement should be created, rather than offering things as gifts, I will remove so many tons of waste huts.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to conduct a very important movement on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On June 5, on World Environment Day, nearly 4000 cities of the country will be able to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of dustbins are being provided, one in green color, the second in blue color.
Two types of waste are being extracted - one liquid waste, other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulations, we have to keep these waste cottages in 4000 cities, we have to put the dry waste in a blue-coloured basket, we have to put the liquid waste in a green cottage.
In the kitchen wastes, the vegetables, the remaining food, the leaves of the eggs, the leaves of the trees etc. should be put in a green waste.
And if we remember the greenery of the fields, then you will remember what to put in green waste cottages.
The second type of waste is that of paper wastes, card coaches, iron materials, glass pieces, clothing, plastics, polythenes, broken baskets, rubber products, metals, all these should be placed in the dry waste compartment, which will be restored to the machines.
A few days ago, one thing had come to the ears and Versova Beach, considered to be a clean seashore in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful seashore today.
For this purpose, Afroz Shah gave him the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP a great award.
He is the first Indian to receive Champions of the Earth.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days and months, there has been discussions and analysis of the current government's three-year activities in newspapers, TV channels and social media.
Three years ago, you have given me the responsibility of the main servant.
A large number of polls have been conducted and a large number of polls have been conducted.
I see all this as a healthy symptom.
During the last three years, he had spoken in every speech.
People at all levels of society have studied this.
This is a remarkable function in the democratic system.
The governments are responsible for answering in democracy should be my clear, enormous idea, dedicated to the people of the gestures, the account of the work done.
I express my gratitude to all those who have spent time, who have studied our work in depth, suggested, supported and expressed their grievances, I consider these things very important.
I also express my gratitude to those who have given important references to me.
Whatever crimes are there, there is a possibility of correction only when it is revealed.
Whether the functioning is good, less benefits can be scared, worst, however, learn from them, it can lead to progress.
Critic criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This washing and research is very important for a aware country and a country with knowledge.
My dear countrymen, I am a common citizen like you, as well as as a common citizen, all that is bad as good as a common citizen, affects me as a common citizen.
Some people see the voice of Mann Ki Baat, some criticize it from a political perspective, but I don't even think when I started it that Mann Ki Baat will change me to every family of India, I feel after a long experience.
I feel like sitting in the middle of a family and talking about household things.
I am gratitude to the President, to the Vice President and to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, to all those who were in such high positions, to distribute their golden time and to give importance to the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
In a way, Manadin's voice has created a new dimension to me.
Some of our friends had interacted with me sometimes when they were engaged in the work on the book Mandin Voice.
I have borrowed to Akbar Sahab.
My fascinating countrymen, the next time when we meet, the weather will change in all the places of the country, the results of the climate will change, the results of the examinations will start learning again.
Let us all come together, in this environment, we will love nature and move forward.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time so many capable instruments come in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, these are being discussed in detail on the government side.
What kind of complaints are the experience of the people
We can generally see that giving advice to others is the natural nature of humans.
It is natural for us to advise and instruct somebody to do this immediately when we travel by train and buses.
Initially, when suggestions came to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there was a word of suggestions, and it was a habit for many of our team members, but when we tried to reach it, I was really very happy in the flood.
After I pointed out that in the Narendra Modi App, on the MyGov portal, all of them have taken innovative methods to prevent food waste from the corner of the country.
I don't even think that especially the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this activity for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been doing it for years, but the youth of my country are engaged in it.
Many have sent me videos.
The bread bank is being run at many places.
People get bread from their sides, bring vegetables and those who need bread and get it.
Those who provide happiness and buyers do not need to consider themselves low.
This is an example of how cooperation is being done in the society.
Today is the last day of the month of April.
Institution Day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in May.
On this occasion, my warm greetings to the people of both the states.
Both the States have been in constant efforts to achieve new developmental heights and have contributed to the progress of the country.
In both the states, great men have emerged and their lives have inspired us in every field of society.
Keeping in mind these great men, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the States, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of 2022, when we are 75 years of independence, we should take this pledge to elevate our states, our country, our society, our city and our family on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the states.
We must move forward with the help of all citizens to fulfill that commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of both the states.
At a time, the environmental change was only a matter of speaking at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily life, we are experiencing this and feeling disappointed.
Nature has changed the norms of its flame.
This time we have experienced the temperature in the months of May-June in our country in the months of March-April.
While I was considering people's suggestions for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there were more suggestions about what we should do during the summer.
All things are known and not new, but at the right time it will be very beneficial to re-imagine them.
Prasad Kumar Misra, T.
They have said that water should be poured on the surface in the balcony.
I have seen that even small children in the family have done this thing better.
If they think why they have to fill the water then they will be able to see if they have water in the utensil ten times a day.
Not only this, but also the birds come and drink water, and they see the sinners carefully.
It may seem to be like a game, but indeed, it is a wonderful experience of compassion in the minds of that pinch.
Music life with birds and animals and nature in our country is inherent in our nervous systems, but at the same time it is important to strengthen the efforts being made at the social level.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Dharmaguru Saithana Saheb of Daudi Bohra community was 100 years old.
He lived for 103 years.
To commemorate his 100th anniversary, the people of Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the Gurus through the Purhani Trust.
It also got place in Kinnas World Records Book.
Sometimes, if we are so busy, we also forget to ask if we are dairy, vegetable sellers, postalists, who are at the door of our household, if you drink a mouth of water in this summer heat.
My young friends, I would like to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that some of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place, in a comfortable place.
Mother-father grows them very safely.
There is a rope like this, but most people are in the round of the rope.
Now the exams have been completed and you have made plans for spending holidays.
After the heat is over, the summer vacation will be slightly sweet.
I give you three suggestions to use the holiday time well, three of which are special if you are implemented, but I am trying to do something of them.
Take a new experience, try to get a new capability, let's go to a place where no one has heard, no one has heard, no one has seen, no one has known.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
The test must be positive, let's get out of the round of your luggage.
We belong to middle class families and comfortable families.
In the evening, take your football or a cantonment or take other sports items and go to the dwelling place of the poorest of the poor.
Play with the poor children of this place, you will feel that when you have not enjoyed playing in your lives so far.
Have you imagined how big changes will happen in their lives when such a poor child gets the joy of playing with you
Once you go, your mind will want to go there again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several volunteers are engaged in service.
Search yourself with a humble guru and connect you with an organisation for 15 days and 20 days.
At some points, the summer camps will be organized, the administrative development camps will be organized, and several creative camps will be conducted and connect you with them.
After taking part in such camps, learn to the poor who have no opportunity to learn that which you have learnt as a service free of cost.
You can teach them how to do.
Though technology has been considered to reduce distances and dissolve the boundaries, the evil consequences of this are scratching my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room in one house but they cannot even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone has lost their lives due to technology.
Social nature is a good value, social nature is a power.
Another thing I have spoken about the capabilities, don't you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is turning into a robot.
Our younger generation lives in machine life Friends, the dreams we see in life are all good things.
But we should not interfere with the human elements within us, we should keep in mind that we do not leave our humanity.
Can we not pay any attention to skill development
We are trying to spend time with us a little away from technology.
If you don't know swimming, you can learn swimming, you can learn to draw the painting, you can't go very well, but in paper you can learn meditation
The feelings within you will reflect in it.
All these capabilities and activities will make you feel happy, not only will you be able to get rid of the bonds that you have built on one side.
Do something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your lives.
If you think that after all the examinations have been completed, after coming to a new position in your business, I would like to imagine all this, you would have had the opportunity to do so.
So I would like to tell you whether there is a country learning magic, you can learn a ticket table.
Happy showing this to your friends.
If you do not know anything, try to learn it, and it will surely benefit you.
Awaken the creative capabilities within you, which will create a favourable platform for development.
I share my experience with you, friends, we cannot even imagine what things we have to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new circles.
Don't think of traveling too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there.
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a great opportunity.
New generations have released nearly cash transactions.
You are engaged in this but you can earn through this scheme and you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with it and if you do 3 transactions then you will get 10 rupees income for this.
Your account will be added 10 rupees to the government.
If you say that in a day, 20 people will be included in it, then in the evening, 200 rupees will be kept in your pocket.
Businesses can also earn through this and students will also get income through this.
The project will be upto 14th October.
You can make your contribution to make Digital India.
You are the guardians of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Honourable Prime Minister, I speak from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Choubey.
I would like to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your decision.
The decision taken by the government to end the red light is an institutional step.
But this culture that has been rooted in mind must be rooted out.
If we all work together with awareness then it can be removed.
When I say that my objective was clear - Every Person is Impartant, everyone is important.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country, if we understand the importance of 125 crore people then there will be a great power to realize the greatest dreams.
We all have to do this together.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the great Ramanujara of 125 crore countrymen.
Because of some reason we got stuck in the tubes, we got very small and we got too much to think about centuries.
Century is also considered to be extremely important in other countries of the world.
Just imagine.
Even today, how difficult it is to dismantle social conditions
How was this one thousand years ago
Some people must have known that the bitterness of the society, the feeling of the eldest and the impoverished, the unprotected, the unprotected, the slaughter of the caste, had built a big struggle against the position of caste.
Whoever the society considered to be inadequate, embraced him and demonstrated him through his action.
Thousands ago, he conducted a campaign for his entry into the temple and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will also release a postage stamp to commemorate the commemoration of Holy Iramanujacharya on 1st May.
I salute the sacred Ramanujacharya with respect and offer my devotional flowers.
My heartfelt countrymen, there is another significance on May 1 tomorrow.
In many parts of the world, it is adopted by the working people as a day.
While speaking as the Day of Workers, there is talk of labour and labour, it is natural for me to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the concessions and respects of the workers.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the labourers is unforgettable.
Today when we talk about Baba Saheb, when we talk about the sacred Ramanujacharya, we have got the opportunity to remember the great pious and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century.
There was also an opportunity to release a composition of his own languages.
In the 12th century, he spoke deeply about labour and labour in Kannada.
In Kannada, he said, "Kaya Kave Kailas", which means that you can only reach the calamity of Lord Shiva through hard work, that is, heaven can only be achieved by working.
While talking about the labourers, it is natural to think about them.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate it as a festival.
The ideas of Lord Buddha are very suitable when the world looks at the violence, war, destruction and arms confrontation today.
In India, it is an excellent example of breaking the war of life of Ashoka and adopting Buddha.
This great day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated as United Nations Visak Day.
This year, the event will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I am blessed to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
We want to be music with our neighbouring countries and also to move forward.
There are many potential.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capabilities of this satellite and its facilities will help significantly in economic and development activities in South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our endeavour to South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are united with the preparations for the selection of their children.
Today is 26th March.
We are proud that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories are all commendable wealth.
In 1919, the massacre of Jallianwala Bagh was slaughtered, while Rabindranath Tagore was one of the men who made a loud voice against the massacre.
The murder had a profound impact on the mind of a child who was twelve years old.
Three days ago, on March 23, the British took Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukdev and Rajguru
When this tragic incident took place on 23rd March, there was no fear of death in the faces of the martyrs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru who made a joy to the mother of India.
They gave all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
All these three are still conscious of us.
The sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru cannot be done in words.
The whole of the English empire was interrupted by seeing these three.
They were imprisoned, punished, but were worried about how to conduct them.
Several years ago, when I had the opportunity to go there for the first time, I could feel a kind of shock on that soil.
Whenever you all get the opportunity, I urge the youth of the country to visit the place where the tombs of Bhagad Singh, Sukdev, Rajguru and Bhagad Singh are located.
It was a time when the freedom demand and its intensity were broad.
On the one hand, soldiers like Bhagad Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth to make armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April 1917, Gandhijis conducted Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time, the expression of Gandhijis thoughts and the methods of Gandhijis in the freedom struggle of India came out in Champaran.
This was a turning point in the freedom struggle journey, especially from the point of view of the methods of struggle.
Champaran Satyagraha, Geda Satyagraha, Milk Workers Strike in Ahmedabad, this was a time when Gandhiji's thoughts and methods began to have a profound impact.
In 1915, Gandhijis returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new impetus to the country.
Today, we cannot assess the Champaran Satyagraha with the idea of Gandhijis in our mind.
Just imagine, one who returned to India in 1915, just two years of experience...
He highlighted a wonderful strength through the integration of Gandhijis through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to know the pulse of the Indian society, the power to inspire the poorest and illiterate people against the British and bring them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how to start a public life, how to work for it, how to work for Gandhijis.
The great leaders of that period like Rajendra Babu and Acharya Grubalani, all the Gandhians worked to go to the village.
He taught them how to connect with the freedom struggle with the people and their works.
Today we are traveling in the 21st century, who would not like to change India in todays times, who would not like to participate in the transformation of the country
Their efforts to transform this desire of 125 crore people will be a strong foundation for building a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the challenge of 125 crore people of the country.
This is the feeling of building a New India in collaboration with 125 crore people.
125 crore people of the country have a desire, a desire, a satisfaction, a thirst.
They are engaged in this work as peacefully as penancers.
Many go to the hospital every day and help the patients.
Immediately after asking about the need, there are many who run away and donate blood.
There are also many people who have a good job to feed them if someone switchs in a bowl.
Our country is a country of such valuable values.
Peoples service is Magasan Seva, it is all in our nerves.
If we look at it in a holistic way, we look at it in a coordinated manner, it is very well aware of how great it is.
When we talk about a New India, it is a natural matter that criticisms about this idea can be accepted in a democratic manner.
But if 125 crore people are determined, if they decide their path, they start stepping up one after the other, then the dreams of 125 crore people of the country to cook a New India will begin to emerge when we see it.
There is no need for all the things to be included in the budget or the government's plan or the government's money to be spent.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should fulfill his duties as a citizen and understand the responsibilities.
Why should we not do this journey to make our autonomy a good testimony with regulations and satisfaction
I invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the past few months, a large number of people in our country have participated in the Digital Money Transfer Mission.
After the withdrawal of currency, there are many improvements in the digital system of payment.
When we started the Bhim App for 2-3 months, so far about 1. 5 crore people have given this opportunity.
My dear countrymen, we must move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Is it possible that 125 crore people of the country will be able to make digital transactions this year
In order to implement this, we can digitally distribute the school kitchen, we can make travel ticket fees for traveling by railways or airplanes digitally, if we buy medicines digitally, if we run cheaper food items, then we can take ways for digital transactions.
In the past, several programmes have been organized for the Digital Celebrations for the awareness of the people.
The promise was made to do 100 events across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won the awards.
Everyone will be determined to carry forward this task.
A big kulkal is also organised.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM App even if it is possible for Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
We must contribute to reducing cash usage.
My dear countrymen, every time you have been giving me a variety of suggestions as per my request for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But I can see that in your suggestions you have been putting more pressure on cleanliness.
This river is crossing the Rispana bridge and it flows near my house.
We have tried to make people aware about the pollution of the river, we have taken part of the area and walking on foot, but there is no benefit from this.
I urge you to create awareness about this matter whether you have sent a team from your side or through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, Look at the pain of a student studying in class 11.
I see this as a good sign.
Awareness has also been created since the launch of the Swachhta Mission.
Everyone has made a positive link to it.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
The hatred against cleanliness has been increasing.
Whether it is aware, it is a constructive contribution, it is a movement.
Though the work is hard, it must be done.
I am confident that this feeling of the new generation of the country, the adults, the students and the youngsters is reflecting a good symptom.
Today, in the voice of my mind, I would like to tell all those who have heard the idea of Gayatri - the message given by Gayatri should be a message to all of us.
Famous countrymen, since the beginning of Mann Ki Baat programme, there have been several suggestions for me to waste food.
We all know that when we have food in our homes and public events, we have more food in our layers than required.
Have we ever imagined how many ruins we destroy by the remaining remains that we leave
If we don't have the remainings, do you think it would help the poor to feed
But the generosity shown in this regard is a great tragic act of living against society.
This is injustice to the poor.
On the other hand, if the food is not wasted, the savings will be done and the family will get economic benefits.
It is a good thing to think socially and to look familyly, it is a beneficial thing.
I want to be more aware of this.
I know some youngsters who have launched a mobile app and have launched a campaign
If there is any food left, they will be informed that they will collect the remaining food and share it to the needy.
This method of enhancing food is being done by the youngsters of our country.
You can meet such people in every state of India.
Let's see the way to see changes.
They always say that those who are aware of the health of the body, take a little less in the leaves and fill a little in the stomach.
World Health Day on April 7.
The United Nations has set the target of Universal Health Coverage, Health for All by 2030.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from stress.
Talk to friends, to parents, to brothers and sisters, to the teachers, to the same thing as you are inside.
Have you thought a little bit about why they are doing so
You must understand that they are at the first stage of stress.
Depression, psychological and physical disorders.
Just as diabetes provides a comfortable resilience to all kinds of diseases, psychological stress and our capability to fight against the stringent environment, our volunteering capabilities and decision-making capabilities.
If you are not able to speak openly to your dependents, then people should work with a sense of service at some place near you.
Take full service, participate in their comfort and sorrow, you can see yourself dissolving your sadness.
If you try to understand the sorrow of others and do it with a sense of service, then you will enhance your self-confidence.
You can easily overcome the burden of your mind through interaction with others, through selfless service to others.
Similarly, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You start making your efforts from now on.
Ensure that lakhs of people participate in the social Yoga Day.
If there is any suggestion in your mind about the 3rd International Yoga Day, you must send your suggestions to me through the mobile app.
You can create songs and compositions about yoga, so that peoples understanding can be increased.
Today, I would like to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have spoken several things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a big resolution.
It is a matter of welcome that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and their contribution is increasing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April, the holy Ramanavami, the 9th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar Ji on 14th April.
May the lives of these great men always inspire us and urge us to cook a New India.
After spring, when the crops begin to grow and the farmers' labour will get the benefit.
This New Year is celebrated in many ways in every corner of our country.
My New Year greetings to all of you.
The weather is now hiding.
The spring is registering its visit in the lives of all of us.
After the autumn, new turmerics have started sprinkling in the trees, flowers bloom, jungles, gardens and sunsets are swelling in greenery.
Not only the flowers, the mines also shine in the brimstone of Athavan.
Mangani's fans have started to appear in the spring.
In the fields, the yellow flowers of mustard yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow.
Flowers of Flowers of Flowers are ordered to visit Holly Festival.
These moments of climate change have been described as very tasty.
Wherever the fields blossom mustard crops, trees blossom, flowers blossom, pigeons blossom, kukku cooking, the environment will be comfortable, the man also enjoys the sweetness of this environment.
The festivals of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holip blossom joyful flowers in the life of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we will complete the month of Bhagni and we will be ready to welcome the new month of New Year.
The spring period is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I ask your suggestions before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for sending me a lot of suggestions.
My thanks to all of you who have contributed in the Narendra Modi App, in the Twitter, in the Facebook, through letters.
Shoba Jalan ji has mentioned in the Narendra Modi App that a large number of common people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO.
He further urged you to inform about 104 satellites and intermediate missiles.
Shobaji is extremely grateful to you for recalling the glorious example of India.
Our scientists have reminded India in the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
ISRO has achieved a new world record in space sector a few days ago, after being successful in sending Mangalyaan to Mars to Mars.
At the same time, 104 satellites of many countries have been successfully launched as Bharat.
This is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but also for the entire India.
ISRO's low cost space programme is one of the wonders of the world and the whole world has appreciated the success of Indian scientists.
Brothers and sisters, One of the 104 Satellites is very important - CartoSAT 2D which will help in Indias satellites, films taken through it, identification of mineral resources, infrastructure, developmental assessment and planning of urban development.
Our new satellite, CartoSat 2D, will be offering to my farmer brothers and sisters to know about all the things related to how to use and how to take care of the snacks in the country.
As soon as we have reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It has started working on it.
It is a matter of great pleasure that all these activities are under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
It is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success that the young scientists and women scientists have made such a significant contribution.
On behalf of the people of the country, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO.
You are creating several new accomplishments every day for the people, for the purpose of enforcing space science by keeping in mind the work of the country.
Whatever congratulations our scientists and their entire team, it is less than that.
India has successfully tested an interruption missile from the continent in the defence sector.
This is a great achievement in the defence sector.
You will be happy to note that this technology capability in the world is only with 5 countries in the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile is coming from far and wide, it is capable of destroying the missile.
When we see new technologies, when we see a new scientific achievement, we enjoy our people.
In the past, the mind of the man has been trying to know the rules of the formation.
New science and new technologies are born from this.
Every technology has created a new era in every new scientific form.
My dear youngsters, while talking about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed in the voice of Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should be attracted to science.
Many scientists are required for the country.
Today's scientists are now the factors of a stable change in the life of generations that emerge in the age.
None of the sciences slide from the heavens in a perfect way.
Annal Gandhijis say that all the scientific achievements have been excavated by experience.
Honble Babu Ji has said that we must be appreciative of the thirst, endeavour and sacrifice of our innovative scientists who have worked hard for the truth.
Scientific need to make the principles in accordance with the practice, what means and what kind of technologies are being handled, so that it can become an important role for the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and Indian Foreign Affairs have organized a very unique competition on the day of 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
In Mumbai in 2005, there were huge rains, floods and seas showcased with anger and many calamities.
Whatever natural hazard happens, it is the first door of the poor house.
They decided to find a solution to this, they saved the house in a long time and saved the households from floods and saved them from water-borne diseases.
I could see many such innovations.
I want to say that many people are making such a contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a technology-supporting society.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the past, more emphasis has been laid on digitalization.
Gradually people are moving from cash transactions to digital transactions.
Digital transactions are also growing rapidly in India.
Specifically, young people are making digital payments in their mobile phones.
I see this as a good sign.
Our country has received a lot of welcome in the past, the Lakhi Grahak Yojana, the lucky Consumer Scheme, the Digital Business Yojana and the Digital Business Programme.
In the past two months, 15000 people have received a discount of Rs.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India seems to be transforming into a mass movement and the entire country has welcomed it with double.
It is a matter of privilege that so far, 10 lakh people have got the honor, more than 50,000 traders have got the honor, more than one and a half crore rupees have been given to those who participated in these schemes.
Under this scheme, more than 100 traders have received a sum of one lakh rupees.
More than 4000 traders have received a discount of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, householders and students are connecting themselves with greater enthusiasm.
When I washed it, I came to know that not only young people but also old people participated in it, 15-year-old youth and 65-70-year-old senior citizens.
Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App from Mysore and he has received Rs. 1000 through the fortunate customer scheme (Lakhi Grahak Yojana).
But I would like to share with you that I consider it an important thing in his writings.
Santosh ji, your name and your work give us happiness.
You have made a great sense of inspiration.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his industry after demonetisation and has got a discount of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's fortunate customer scheme.
Today he has become an ambassador of the scheme even though he is driving a car.
He will share information about digital transactions with all passengers traveling in his car.
He is very enthusiastic and also encouraging others.
Puja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, shares his experiences with his friends about how his family uses RuPay Card and e-Wallt, how much joy they get.
Let us lead this movement.
You take this forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
All those who are associated with this task, in my sight, new warriors against corruption.
In a way you're the warriors of honesty.
On April 14, Kullukal is scheduled to be the largest awards.
There are still 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Just a few days ago, Baba Saheb had passed the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
In order to commemorate his memories, you must teach at least 125 people to be given the BHIM app.
This time, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar and the BHIM App will become very important.
I would like to mention this to strengthen the foundation stone of Baba Saheb.
You must ensure that the Bhim App will reach the hands of 125 crore people of the country by going home and connecting everyone with it.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, there has been an increase in many cities and villages in many cities.
Fascist countries, agriculture is the companion of the economic system of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share with you a pleasant information today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the field.
This year, due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been unprecedented production.
All the indexes show that our farmer brothers and sisters have broken the old achievements.
On seeing the museum, every day it seems as if we are celebrating the festival of Golden and Paisakhi.
This year, more than 2,200 million tonnes of revenue has been received.
This is 8 percent more than the last achievement of our farmers.
It's a wonderful achievement.
I especially want to thank the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers - they have yielded various types of pulses, besides cultivating traditional foodgrains, because there is a lot of protein in pulses.
The sound of the poor has fallen in the ears of my farmers and they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred and three hundred hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service for the farmers of my country for the poor.
I express my gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved the record of pulses in magsoorie by listening to one of my requests.
Dear countrymen, in our country, everybody is traveling towards cleanliness by the government, by the society and by the organizations.
In a way, everybody is acting as a people who are aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
In the past, a function for senior officials of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
This seminar was not held within the closed rooms of the state of Telangana, and it was in the form of implementation of the importance of cleanliness work at the bottom.
Training for Opening of Toilets was started in Hyderabad from 17-18 February.
Officials demonstrated how the toilets at 6 houses were wasted and they were cleaned and removed the baskets of two pieces of toilets and how they could be used again.
There is no difficulty, no difficulty, no psychological obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, no obstacles, how comfortable the toilets used for this new technique.
The way we clean up the toilets, the same way we clean up the toilets.
On an average, a double basket toilet for a family with 6 members will be filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be removed easily and it can be returned to the second basket.
The number of things that are shown in it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, several sectors have been organising meetings related to cleanliness once in the weeks related to cleanliness.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will collaborate to strengthen the Swachhta Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and River Ganga Rejuvenation will take up the Swachhta Mission for the last two weeks of March.
Any citizen in our country is engaged in good work, the entire country feels a new energy and fosters self-confidence.
We welcomed the adventures of our talented sportspersons in Rio Parallimbics.
In the end of the D-20 World Cup for visually impaired persons organised this month, India defeated Pakistan and continued to be a world champion for the second time and made the country proud.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all the soldiers who were present.
We are proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends in the country.
I have always thought that our talented brothers and sisters with disabilities are talented, compassionate, accomplished and psychological.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is based on sports or space science, women of our country are not rude to anyone.
And they are moving forward in the same way, through their achievements, they are illuminating the best of the country.
Our women brave men have won the silver medal in the Asian Rakbi Sevens Games in the last few days.
My best wishes to all these heroes.
World Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India too, there should be an increase in awareness and awareness in the family and society.
Today this is not just a government scheme.
It has transformed into a social understanding and a movement of education for all.
This scheme has connected the people's society in the last few years, has kept thinking about this important thing in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of the people about the old habits that have been going on for decades.
There is a lot of joy in the mind when there is a fall in the ears that there is a news of the birth of a girl child.
In a way, positive thinking about women's children is due to social acceptance.
I heard that due to a special campaign in Tamil Nadu and Tamil Nadu, sexual abuse has been stopped.
So far, more than 175 sexual abuses have been stopped.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60 thousand girls under the Suganya Samruti scheme.
Under the Convergence Model (Convergence Model) in Kutwa district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been associated with the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao programme, the village councils are also being organized and the district administration is making every effort to ensure that orphans and children are educated.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being launched for the education of the daughters of every household, every household, every household and every household.
The movement of our children, our schools, our schools and the women who are running the campaign, who have stopped half the school education in the state of Rajasthan, is going on to re-school and re-school them.
I am telling you that Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Mission has been adopting various forms.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It travels in collaboration with innovative ideas.
This has been revised according to regional requirements.
I consider it a good symptom.
On the 8th of March, when we celebrate Women's Day, we must be united with a sense of consciousness. You all get the opportunity to talk about something or the other in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You have come together positively with this.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
I have the feelings of the world, the condition of the villages and the feelings of the poor.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Our ancestors have created a system of climate, economic cycle and social life, in any circumstances, that there should never be a recession in society.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after tens of thousands of years, every festival brings new energy in itself with a new inspiration...
Sometimes he picked up the mountain, sometimes he worked to remove the leaves of food, that is, we feel a new innovation in every activity of him.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my child goes to two monkeys milk.
One will bear Sudarshan Chakra Mohan and others will bear Sarka.
Mohan, who crossed Sudarshan Chakra, ran away the river Yamuna and went to the sea coasts of Gujarat and settled in Dwarakai city, but Mohano, on the shores of the sea, came to the shore of the Yamuna and left his last breath in Delhi.
Mohan, who bears Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellectuals, his duties, his capabilities and his thoughts in accordance with the circumstances of that time, thousands of years ago, to avoid war and live without conflict.
At the same time, Mohano, who has given a new shape to the freedom struggle to secure the country's independence, to protect human values and to strengthen the basic principles of governance, has made a new dimension for the entire world, which is still unique till date.
What is the importance of selfless service, what is the importance of wisdom and what is the importance of smiling between all the upliftments of life, we can learn from the life of Lord Shri Krishna
Today, when we are talking about festivals, India is engaged in a big celebration.
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Anna Gandhi Ji.
On October 2, 1869, at the coastal coastal Warbandar, today we were born in a small house called Kirti Mandir, not an individual but an era.
This gave a new turn to the entire human history and made a new achievement.
One thing was always linked to the Gandhians, in a way it was brightened as a permanent part of his life - service, service and service.
If we see his entire life, he was engaged in the service of the people of the societies suffering from diversity in South Africa, in that period, it is not a small thing.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran.
If anybody needs help, water will help in serving at any time.
He not only strengthened the service but also reaffirmed the spirit of service.
But at the same time, there is also a unique experience of enjoyment and self-interest of health.
We can clearly understand this through the life of Anna.
The Gandhians, the individuals, the society, the man and the man are everything.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix cultivation or Talstai cultivation or Sabarmati Ashram or Varta, he has always strengthened social integration in a different way to himself.
I believe that I have got the privilege of visiting several important places related to my brother and paying homage there.
And when it comes to be a society, it has a strong strength and it must be a social expression and service in this programme of Gandhi 150.
Whatever the mind feels, it should be a good wish, it should be a good intention, it should be a harmonious, it should be a complete dedicated service, a self-dedicated service and a comfortable enjoyment.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I had gone to Dandi in Gujarat.
Tandi, who was named salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was a big turning point.
In Tandi, I inaugurated the state-of-the-art museum dedicated to the water.
I urge you all to visit some place related to Annal Gandhiji.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions are planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, in Venice Beennale, several interesting scenes of Gandhijis memories have been observed.
The part of Haripura is very interesting.
You must have remembered that during the Haripura Congress convention of Gujarat, the event of the election of Subhash Chandra Bose ji was recorded in history.
A very beautiful past has emerged in these arts.
Prior to the Haripura conference of Congress, Annal had invited Nandlal Bose, the then Chief Minister of Shantiniketan's Kala Bhavan in 1937-38.
Gandhijis wish to showcase the lifestyle of people living in India through art, this artwork should be exhibited at the conference.
This is the handicraft of Nandla Bose who enhances the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose roamed around the villages near Haripura and finally painted the rural life.
Intensive discussions took place in Venice about these invaluable works.
Once again, with the best wishes of the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Gandhians, I hope that every Indian should make some or the other commitment.
For the country, for the society, something has to be done for some good thing.
This can be a tribute to the best and genuine activity that we can do to his brother.
You must have remembered that for the last few years, we have been launching the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
This movement has the enthusiasm of all sections of the society.
All my business brothers and sisters have been hanging a notification plaque in their shops and they have written in it that when the customers come from home, they should come with courage.
This will save money and our contribution in protecting the environment.
This time, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Anna on 2nd October, we should dedicate to him the India free from the habit of open defecation and set the foundation stone for a new mass movement against dense materials across the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to every small part of the village, to the city, to bow down and bow down and to celebrate this year on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in a way that we should observe this mother of India to get rid of defecation.
I also urge private corporations that you should come forward to remove all these dense materials after collecting them.
They can be revised.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot of progress.
Today, I would like to touch a more important thing than a Sanskrit language.
Even though it was written centuries ago, do you know how important it is even today
The moods call stones as jewellery.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
We have also made the knowledge of food scientific.
A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for us, especially for women and children, because they are the future foundations of our society.
POSHAN Abhiyan is becoming a mass movement under the Nutrition Mission and providing nutrition to modern methods across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once one thing was brought to my attention.
There was a massive movement of cereals in Nasik.
During the sixty days, Anganwadi brothers and sisters collect a handful of grains from the people.
These grains are used for hot food prepared for children and women.
This is done when the child starts giving solid food for the first time.
Not liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful endeavour, it can be seen everywhere.
In many states, people are organising a campaign called Diti Bhojan.
The family goes to Anganwadi by preparing nutritious food and nutritious food to Anganwadi, the family goes to Anganwadi, the family goes to the school, the family goes to the children on their own.
They share their happiness, they do not reduce when happiness is shared.
With the spirit of service, the feeling of joy also shines as a wonderful confluence.
Friends, Through many such small things, we can foster a strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, due to lack of awareness, poor and selfless people are suffering from malnutrition due to lack of nutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a Poshan Mission across the country.
You must be associated with this, get information and add new ideas to it.
If you bring one or two persons out of malnutrition then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I had a lot of faith that questions about this matter would be heard.
And in the last few weeks, whenever I went anywhere, whenever I met the people, Man Vs Wild was spoken about.
I don't even imagine that I will get this opportunity to get a place in the minds of the world-class youth.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Whenever I have the opportunity to go to the Prime Minister, I start asking me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes, if I have the opportunity to go to the world, if I have the opportunity to go to the world due to International Yoga Day.
So far, I have no discussions about Yoga as a world leader and this has been my experience all over the world.
But now there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about the matters related to wildlife, they are engaged in environmental discussions.
165 countries are in the process of broadcasting this programme in their language.
But one more interesting thing, some people ask me something with a little bit of comfort, Modiji, you speak in Hindi, Bear Grills knows the Hindi language, how could you talk so fast
Is this subsequently subjected to collection
Look, there's no secret in it.
The fact is that technology was fully used to interact with Bear Grills.
After this event, a large number of people have started discussing all about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places connected with nature and wildlife.
I have already said that now I repeat it and you must visit the Northeastern states in your life.
Your life is huge.
Your thoughts will be huge.
I got the privilege to release the calculation of wildlife in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The number of tigers in India is 2967.
A few years ago, the number of them was only half.
The LTTE summit took place in 2010 in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It was expressed concern over the declining number of LTTE in the world and was ensured in the end.
This commitment is to double the number of LTTE in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India, because of which we are achieving the targets at a rapid pace, we have doubled the number of LTTEs in 2019.
India has not only increased the number of LTTE but also the number of protected areas and social security forces.
When I released the statistics related to the LTTE, I remembered the lions in the Gir forests of Gujarat.
When I was the Chief Minister, the lions were decreasing their residence in the jungles of Kir.
Their numbers were also declining.
We took steps one after the other in the jungles of Kir.
In 2007, we decided to place women police in charge.
We have developed the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is necessary to create a proper environment to protect our forests, vegetations and wildlife only on the day that we are sufficient to protect our wildlife.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
This young saint of India, who has raised humanity from sleeping all over the world, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave India that the world has seen with a glorious vision, the world has changed the vision of seeing India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on 11th September, 1893.
Let us see the form of Swami Vivekanand Ji of India and Swami Vivekanandji has seen the strength of India, we will try to live it.
It is within us, everything is, we will move forward with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, on 29th August we are celebrating National Sports Day.
This will be yours, it will be a very interesting movement for all children, elderly, youth and women.
But I am not going to say anything about their subtle things today.
I would like to create awareness about sex in your minds and decide some goals together for a stable India and for our country.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the jewellery, we will be able to get rid of the jewellery, we will be able to get rid of the jewellery, we will be able to get rid of the jewellery, we will be able to get rid of the jewellery.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
On 26th January, our President celebrated the day with joy and joy all over the country.
It is a cultural festival in a way that the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the powers of the citizens and the democratic system, and makes them aware of the democratic responsibilities of the future generations.
However, there is still no such debate in the widespread and depth of the duties and rights of the citizens in our country.
Tomorrow on 30th January, our salutational rice is hidden.
On January 30, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we all salute two minutes and pay tributes to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the nation.
In the form of a society and a nation, it is natural for us to pay a two-minute quiet tribute at 11 a.m. on 30th January.
It is only two minutes but it has sociality and satisfaction and the expression of our concern for the martyrs.
We have expressed natural respect for the army and the security forces of our country.
I convey my best wishes to the soldiers and their relatives who have been honoured by various medals for the brave men who have been awarded on this occasion of the President.
These medals include Kirti Chakra, Shurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I appeal to the youth especially that you can do a job that you are working on social workplaces.
This time, all those who have been honoured, you will find another good word on the web site and share it with your friends.
When we know deeply about the adventure, valour and valour of those soldiers, we will be surprised, pride and inspiration.
While we have experienced great enthusiasm and joy with news related to January 26, some of our soldiers who are engaged in the security of our country in Kachmeer have died due to snowfall.
I salute all the soldiers who have laid down their lives in this.
My young friends, you all know that I have constantly heard the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The four months of January, February, March and April are challenging for every family.
Even though there is a choice for a child in the house, the entire family is crying on the burden of the examinations.
I always feel that I should come out of this situation, so today I would like to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
I know that this question is in the minds of all of you, though Christ has asked this question.
Exams must be a joyful occasion.
For most people, the time of examination remains stressful.
You must decide whether you consider it as a joyful time or not you feel it as a time to put pressure on it.
Those who consider it to be a stressful time, they are sad - pleasure for pressure.
Therefore, I believe that the time of the election is a festival, a festival.
Whenever the festival comes, the speciality within us is evident.
The entire family must work as a team and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this festival.
There will be a change when you are watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, this is the only choice in three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to transform everybody into a three-four-month celebration in accordance with their traditions and their family environment.
If you were joyful, if you were with a smiling face, you would feel confident that in such a situation many years old things would also be easily reflected in your memories.
One year ago, what the teacher said in the classroom will be very illuminated in your mind.
Sindhana Shakti is stagnant and it is also a burden.
We cannot even imagine how many of the beneficial things will come into the mind suddenly, if we are depressed, if we forget things, if we are confident.
You don't have information and knowledge or you haven't worked hard.
But whenever there is pressure, your knowledge, your knowledge, your knowledge will disappear, your pressure will ride on you.
That's why I tell you that a happy me is the secret for a good mark-sheet, a happy mind is the opening of higher values.
Sometimes I have to say that we don't get the exams in the right perspective.
This is not a speech for your life.
How did you live in your life, how do you live in your life, how do you think of living in your life is not an experiment for life.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of contempt for us.
He went to the Air Force and failed.
Estimates have become more important.
This has resulted in the increase in drunkenness and the pressure in the minds of the students has increased in a big way.
In such a situation, I would like to know your views on the modern tendency of education and its future.
If you believe in these things, then the values and the winds will be shut down like the wind door.
It is necessary to know where I have reached today, what is the status of my knowledge till yesterday.
I have explained this illustration that if we talk about the world of sports, it will soon be in mind.
Most of the successes take place in their lives due to sportspersons competing themselves.
You will take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
He has constrained several achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new achievement every time he has achieved his previous achievement.
His journey of life is very wonderful because he has pursued the way to challenge himself by giving up competition to others.
Friends, You will have to write an examination in every field of life when you have to study for two hours, can you study for three hours
You must have decided to wake up at how many o'clock in the morning and it may have been delayed, but can you get up at the time decided now
Therefore, I urge you to compete with others and challenge yourself.
It should be kept in mind how I worked earlier and how I moved ahead and how I worked better.
With this perspective, you will be able to enhance the change in your approach.
S.
Sundar ji, you're absolutely right.
You might have noticed that even today, if you see those who ask me questions and those who give me advice, the number of women in it is more.
Because when we see how many mothers are aware of the future of children in the households and work positively then they simplify many things.
You should act as a guide with the capabilities that you have, whatever work you have, take time out.
Once you have a habit of accepting, most of your problems will come to an end.
The aspirations of parents and teachers are synonymous with problems.
The acceptance of the existence is the only way to solve the problems.
Aspirations make the path even more difficult.
You will be able to comfort the burden.
In a way, we are going to see the patient and we are afraid of the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that at some times we also make such a fear to our children.
Have you ever seen that there should be a pleasant environment in the days of examination
You will see that the environment changes completely.
I got a miraculous phone call.
He didn't want to mention his name.
If you ask why he didn't want to mention his name, you would be aware of it.
"Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of what I have done in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of savings, the thirst that learns in life will be lost.
A phone call came, "Prime Minister, my name is Monica, I would like to ask you two questions about my examinations when I read in class 12.
It is a common idea that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of focus on education.
This basic idea is wrong and this is the man of the problem.
If you want to get a complete development, there is a life that crosses the curriculum, which is very large.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
Whether it's five minutes, surely rest a little.
You can feel that your work is not difficult.
I don't know whether everyone likes it or not, but this is my experience.
When I speak on the platforms during the elections, sometimes my voice will refuse to cooperate.
Once a folk singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long are you sleeping.
I have not even thought that there will be a connection between my sleep, my speech and my voice, he has given me the basic treatment.
If we understand the importance of such basic matters then we will get many benefits.
Do not do so, otherwise your family is going to be angry with me.
If you don't see your estimation on the day you come, then I will see them only.
Please don't do that.
It's a very big hair to keep mind, intelligence and body active.
Well, young friends, while you are engaged in the arrangements for your exams, I am talking about something, I believe that perhaps I have said today that you may be comfortable.
But I urge you not to be burdened even what I have said.
If possible, don't do it.
Remember the resolution you have taken, believe in you, go to the elections, my best wishes to all of you.
Challenge that challenge before facing every challenge.
Then the challenge will not be a challenge.
Keep this mantra in mind and move forward.
My dear countrymen, 40 years of Indian Coast Guard will be completed on 1st February 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the Coast Guard officers and the soldiers for their commitment to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that our Coast Guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is four of the world's four largest coastal guards.
The Mantra of Coast Guard is Vayam Raksham.
Following this objective, the coastal guards are awakened overnight in negative conditions to protect the coastal areas and coastal areas of the country.
Many people don't know that not only men but women are successfully performing their duties with shoulders and shoulders on the coastline of our country.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are airplanes and supervisors and are driven by Hover Graft.
As the coastal police has become the worlds largest thing today, I extend my heartfelt greetings to the Indian Coast Guard on its 40th anniversary, which is engaged in the coastal security of India.
Basant Panchami is a big festival of Saraswati Puja in our country.
It is considered an opportunity to praise education.
Not only this, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
Mera Rang Te Basanti Sola, make me suitable for spring - this is an inspirational idea.
On this auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, I extend my warm greetings to my people.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani has always added new colors in new versions, in accordance with his creativity.
In the last two months, they are spreading the voice of Mann Ki Baat in the state languages as soon as they have completed my Mann Ki Baat.
This is a great welcome.
I have a great opportunity to travel with you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you on Christmas Day.
Today's day has to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion to our lives.
Many wealthy people came and provided united wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came and cast two copper cattle.
Today, on their birth anniversary, we pay homage to them.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Malaysia's penance, Varanasi.
I laid the foundation stone for the prestigious Madan Mohan Malaviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre will be established not only in Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also in Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, Bharat Ratna is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we were proud of the nation in the field of nuclear energy.
Atal ji's distinguished contribution to him as a party leader, as a member of Parliament, as a minister or as a prime minister, has made him an example.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I convey my sincere greetings to him and convey my best wishes to him.
As an employee, I got a big deal to work with Atal ji.
His memories reflect greenness in front of my hearts.
Today, on the eve of Christmas, the benefits of two schemes are available to the people of the country.
In a way, we can see both of them as the start of new projects.
Whether it is a village or a city or a city or a reader or a pocket or a cashless transaction, we can see the keenness to know about how to do cashless business and how to buy things without cash.
Everyone wants to learn the ways related to it from each other.
Likewise, the Digital Business Programme (DDBP) has been incentive to traders and will be awarded to 15,000 persons as Christmas Prize on 25th December
This project is going to take place for 100 days from today.
Every day 15,000 people will get a prize of Rs. 1000 per day.
Digi Dhan Business Programme is mainly for traders.
There is also a great opportunity for the businessmen to pave the pairs that are comfortable.
This scheme is designed by focusing on all sections of society, especially the poor and the lower middle class
Those who buy goods worth Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefits.
This is not for those who buy more than Rs. 3000.
The poor of the market will also be able to buy and sell goods using USSD, feature phone and simple phones, they will be benefitted from this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India and about 20 crore cards of the poor families and the people who have their accounts can be surprised.
30 crore people will be able to participate in this award soon.
I am sure that the people of the country will take the country in this process and will take the necessary information from the youth around them and will be enthusiastic.
My dear countrymen, I am extremely happy to see the spread of awareness about how to use technology in the country, how to pay e-mode money and how to pay money online.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown up to 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are well aware of how big this resolution is.
Those traders who are making digital payments, who are paying online instead of using cash in their business, such traders have been given income tax concessions.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu, has formed a group headed by them and they are reviewing several schemes.
At the same time, governments have also started and implemented several schemes in their own way.
I am told that Assam State Government has announced that the wealth tax and trade licence fees will be given to the digital payers for 10 percent tax.
If the branches of rural banks carry 75 percent of their accountants from January to March, at least two digital transactions will be paid from the government side to Rs. 50,000.
The Committee has announced that the best Panchayat for Digi Money Transfer will be provided to the villages which have reached 100 digital transactions by 31st March, 2017, with a discount of Rs. 5 lakhs.
Several organizations have been successfully working towards taking digital payments to the rural poor farmers.
Interestingly, the sales of GNFC fertilizers have increased by 27 this year as compared to last year.
100, 80 rupees and 50 rupees in place of availability of 80 rupees and those who are deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But now cashless money is being paid.
Our country is the majority of the youth.
Technology is our handled art.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all the countries in this field.
Our youngsters have made significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital movement.
Our youngsters must add to the new ideas, new technologies and modern methods that can be strengthened to this sector.
At the same time, we have to link ourselves with full force with the movement to get rid of black money and corruption.
I used to ask you before the voice of Mann Kind every month, my sinners, and my sinners, that you may give your advice, and give your views.
Accordingly, tens of thousands of letters from MyGov and narendramodiap have come into consideration this time, of which 80-90 percent of the suggestions are related to corruption and black money elimination and currency elimination.
After seeing all these things, I think it can be written in three ways normally.
Some people have written in detail about the difficulties and difficulties being faced by the citizens due to this withdrawal.
On the other hand, such a wonderful work, such a great work, such a sacred work for the welfare of the country, they mentioned how the poets are taking new ways to gather evacuation and irregular actions at many places.
You have written all these letters to me, and I am grateful to you people for this.
It is commendable that this way has been brought under control of merchandise money.
Though it is true that all of us citizens are facing difficulties, we are all in the fight against corruption and our cooperation in this war gives us happiness.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, as military forces are fighting," Gurumani Kewal ji registered his views on the MyGov base.
Gurumani Kewal ji has written the voice of people reflecting every corner of the country.
They're the factors they make real changes, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the best of those who have not only tolerated many difficulties but also to those who have replied to some people who have been trying to take the people in the wrong direction.
A massive effort has been made to fight against corruption and black money
Not only this, many used their works and intellectuals in the field, and cut off the faces of those who spread foolishness, and lighted the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something impossible
If there are blessings of the great people, is it not the blessing of Isan
I express my gratitude to the people of the country, I salute them and people are participating with full enthusiasm in this Mahayana against corruption and black money.
I hoped that this war against corruption and black money in Parliament would be discussed in a broader manner on the funds provided to political parties.
If the sittings were held in the House, it would have been discussed.
Whoever raises illusions that political parties have been exempted in all forms, it is absolutely wrong to say.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money, they spend their full attention and time in looking for government grievances.
There is also a question that why they are repeatedly changing the rules.
This government is working for the people of Machesar.
The government is engaged in the efforts of the people to listen to their views.
When they handle new strategies, we also have to adopt new ways to break their evil thoughts.
In this war in the form of Vidakkandon and Kodaconton, corruption must be a decision-making for big businesses, harsh practices and black money.
On the other hand, there have been letters from many about what kind of bad practices are being used and what kind of new methods are being used.
On this occasion, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen.
The Government has specifically set up an e-mail address to share such information.
Apart from this, you can also send MYGov to the website.
The government has built a shoulder-strip war against all kinds of evils, such as evils you indicate.
When your cooperation is not over, it is very easy to fight.
The third categories of the letter are also in large numbers.
"Modi Ji, you do not leave alone, do not hesitate, do all the intensive efforts you want to do, do not worry, but if you decide on the way to travel, there is no place to talk about ending the decision and retreat."
My dear countrymen, despite the voice of Mann Ki Baat last time, I had said that even in the midst of all these places, our farmer friends have made stern efforts to break the records set up last year.
This is a comfortable symptom when seen from the point of view of agriculture.
Be it the worker of this country, whether it is a farmer or a young man, the hard work of all these people is getting a new boost to the country.
A few days ago, on the World Economic Forum, India has glorified its name in many sectors.
India has improved in the world class rankings through different indexes is a result of the continuous efforts of our skilled people.
India's standard has improved in the World Banks report on Free Trade.
India has crossed 32 places in the World Economic Organisation Report on World Competitiveness.
We have moved 16 places in the World Performance Index for 2016 and 19 places in the World Banks Infrastructure Services Performance Index for 2016.
Several other reports indicate the same assessment and India is growing rapidly.
My fascinating countrymen, this time the anger of the people of the country was read on the Parliament session.
There has been anger over the functioning of the Parliament at all places.
The President and the Vice President expressed their dissatisfaction openly.
But even in such a situation, when some good things take place, the mind is happy.
Even in the midst of the implementation of the Parliament, the country's attention did not return to a great job.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the government's efforts have been made keeping in mind the goal of development of Divyangjans.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this and I express my gratitude to the crores of disabled persons of the country.
This government is working towards the welfare of Divyangjans.
Individually, I have been trying to enhance its pace in order to take this objective forward.
My aim was to get the rights and pride of the disabled.
Our talented brothers and sisters strengthened our efforts and beliefs by winning four medals in Paralimpics.
They have not only given pride to the country through their successes, but have also made people deep in the magnificent sea through their capabilities.
Our talented brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, our invaluable assets and invaluable powers.
After the enactment of the Act, there has been an increase in employment generation for the disabled persons.
The reservation limit in government services has been increased to 4.
The Act provides special provisions for education, facilities and complaints for disabled persons.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been organized for Divyangjans, you can understand how much the government is understanding with Divyangjans since the instruments have been provided to 5,80,000 Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs.
A new law has been enacted by the spirit of the United Nations.
Earlier, Divyangjans were distributed in seven stages, but now through the law, we have made it 21 ways, out of which 14 new positions have been added.
They have got justice for the first time due to the integration of some disabled persons.
For instance, we add to Thalassemia, Parkinsons, those who are suffering and those who are born blind.
The Indian Cricket Team has won a victory in the 4th position in the anti-UK test competition.
Some of these youngsters are commendable.
Our country's young man Karun Nayar hit 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Not only did Taste Captain Virat Kohli make a good interview, but also took a good leadership.
Indian cricketers off spinner bundle sweller R.
Ashwin's name was announced by the International Cricket Committee ICC 2016 Cricketer of the Year, and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations to all of them and my best wishes.
In the Hockey sector, 15 years later, there has been a very beautiful and excellent news.
The Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
This achievement is a comfortable symptom of the future of India's hockey.
Our daughters have also worked well last month.
If India's women's hockey team won the Asian Champion Cup, India's women's hockey team won the bronze medal in the Asian Cup for those under 18 years ago.
Like every year, during Deepawali, I once again celebrated Deepawali with soldiers and went to the border areas of China.
I celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas along with ITBP, Indian Tibetan border soldiers and soldiers.
I go every time, but this Deepawali experience is unparalleled.
People are not merely sending information, they are connected to the mind
One composed poems, the other made films, the other produced cartoons, the other produced video.
That is, every house is like a residential place of soldiers.
When I saw letters, I told me how much imagination is in the minds of the people, how much feelings are there
A soldier of the army had written to me - Prime Minister, for all of us soldiers, every festival like Deepawali and Holi will be held on the borders
We will spend every moment in the thinking of the country's security.
Yes, however, in the days of festivals, there is a feeling of housing.
But if we want to tell the truth, this time we don't even think of it.
There is no idea whether we are not in the house on this festival day.
Somehow, we are also celebrating Deepawali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, on this occasion of Deepawali, should we disappear with a few moments of experience in the minds of our country's security forces
As a society, as a nation, I urge all of you to mix this feeling in our feelings and inspire all of you that we should remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, the strength and strength of the army will increase by 125 crore.
Just a while ago, all the leaders from the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
These are of the Panchayat Convention of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages of Kashmir Valley.
I had a chance to interact with them for a considerable time.
They had come to talk about the development of their villages, some had come with some demands, but it was natural that when the dialogue began to lengthy, the atmosphere of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children.
These leaders of the village have been touching their hearts with great love and open mind.
When we talked about the schools burnt in Kashmir, I was able to realise the kind of sadness that our countrymen were suffering, the same way that these villagers were also involved in this thing.
They believed that the schools were not burnt, and the future of the children was desolate.
After you returned to your villages, I would like to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am very happy that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise that I have given.
They went to the villages and spread awareness to those who were far away.
A few days ago, 95 of the children of Kashmir participated in the board examinations.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are eager to reach new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
I convey my best wishes to those students for their incentives, along with my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the villagers.
Dear brothers and sisters, This time when I asked the people for suggestions for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the suggestions of all of them came about one thing.
Everyone asked me to speak in detail about the notes of Rs. 500, 1000.
In my speech to the people of the country at 8 pm on 8th November, I talked about the beginning of a transformative process in the country.
Whenever I made this resolution before you, I said that this decision is not simple, it is a difficult thing.
But the resolution is as important as it is important to implement it.
I am sure that a variety of innovations will face difficulties in our average life.
Even then, I had said that this decision was very big and it would be 50 days for us to come back from the impact of this thing and then only after that we can take a step towards normality.
It is not easy to get rid of all the diseases we have been implicating for 70 years.
I can understand all the difficulties you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a big country, so many notes, lakhs of notes and such resolutions are being taken care of by the whole world and every economist is evaluating and evaluating it.
India has immense faith in the 125 crore people of India and 125 crore people of the country will achieve the goal of their commitment.
All sections of the Central Government, State Governments and Regional Local Bodies across the country, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of banking personnel, more than 1. 5 lakh post offices, more than 1. 5 lakh banking agencies participated in this work day and night with dedication.
In the midst of a variety of pressures, all of them are very calm and are fully involved in this regard as an attempt to make a massive change, considering this nation's work as a villain.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this work.
I can see that everyone works in banks and post offices in such a situation.
When it comes to Mann Ki Baat, they are traveling a little more.
One told me that an old man has been crashed at Khandwa place.
Suddenly the money was needed.
I am glad to know that when this thing was taken to the attention of the banking worker there, he went to the house and collected money and saw that there was no problem with treatment.
Several such events are included in TV, media, newspapers and conversations every day.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends, who are working in this great villain, who are the participants.
But if the evil is spread to such a extent, the evil practices are still a habit from some people.
Even now, they are thinking that these corruption money, this black money, this uncalculated money, the benami money, can find some way to live.
They are trying to save their money from the poor, hypnotising the poor, talking or hypnotising their minds, taking money in their accounts, buying some work from them.
Today I would like to tell those people who are not stolen, who are not stolen, who are not stolen, who are not following the law, who are not following the law, who are not doing it, whom the law will see what to do.
But please do not play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes in the records and after the investigation, my beloved poor will not do anything in the problem due to your sins.
A very rigorous law has been enacted in relation to Benami properties, which is going to be implemented and there will be a lot of difficulties.
The government does not want any kind of problem for our countrymen.
I am living in Tirali village of Tirali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have given a good lesson to black money holders and corrupt people through notes of 500 and 1000 rupees.
If this step has not been taken then it will never have a good time for every citizen of India.
For this, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you.
Encouragement of working is increasing when some things are available by the media and people from the government sides.
And when I know what a wonderful talent is with the common man of my country, there is great joy and pride.
Even if you have an old note, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back with hungry, you should go back with food and whenever you have to travel on this path, you must pay the money.
When people go there, they eat food, after two-four-six days, they repay money.
This is the power of my country, the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice.
During the election, I used to interact with tea and this idea spread all over the world.
Many people from all over the world have started talking about tea.
But I didn't know that this tea would be married during the interaction.
On November 17, a wedding took place in Surat with a conversation with tea.
In Surat, Gujarat, a woman had given only tea to those who had come to get married to her households, not to participate in any other festivals, not to make any excellence, there was nothing because money deficit had occurred due to currency deficit.
The demonstrators also considered it a pride.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Burmaar, who have embarked upon their lives in a big fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, this is a great conception.
While giving many blessings to Navparineet Bharath and Daksha, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to you for making the wedding glory a great woman and making it a new opportunity.
When such difficulties come, people make solutions for it very well.
Some people have got immediate benefits through this movement.
The country will be benefited in the days to come, but some people are benefited immediately.
When I asked about what happened, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, due to this resolution of 8th, all of them had come out to pay their old notes.
Out of 47 cities, about Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected during this period last year.
Where is 3000-3500 crores, where is 13000 crores
Isn't it natural for these municipalities to set up toilets for the poor or water supply systems or to set up anganwadi centres
There are many such examples of direct benefits in the eye.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are the strong pillars of our economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen in the midst of the hazards is altering itself.
But today I would like to bow to my country's farmers.
Right now, I have been investigating the details of the sowing of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oil crops, I have an account till 20th November, sowing has increased as compared to the same period last year.
Farmers have found a way in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important resolutions, in which the farmers and villages have been given importance.
Under the Mudra Yojana, efforts have been made to provide loans to them.
Several crores of rupees have been provided to the common people under the Mudra Yojana because crores of people are engaged in such small enterprises and are giving a boost to the business of crores of rupees.
Today, I would like to tell my small business brothers and sisters that you should enter the digital world using this as an opportunity.
You also get the bank's APP through your mobile phone.
Your contribution to creating a cashless society can be very big, you can enhance your business and utilize the entire banking process through mobile phones, we can do business in many ways without handling the notes today.
There are technical ways, they are safe and quick.
I want you to cooperate with the success of this movement and I believe that you should lead the transformation and you can give such a leadership.
I am confident that you can do the business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I would also like to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered more injustice.
One of the wages set in the paper is the other amount given in your hands.
You have to get your full wages, no one has to share it.
You shouldn't be oppressed.
If money comes in your bank accounts, you can also buy goods in a small mobile phone, through which money can be paid, it doesn't need any smart phone, it doesn't even work as an e-Wallet.
Therefore, my labour brothers and sisters, I would like to contribute to this scheme so much because I have made such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived, the victims and the victims to get the benefits.
Today, I would like to interact with the youth especially.
In India, 65 percent of the people below 35 years of age are dandora.
I am also aware that you have been contributing to taking this forward in a positive way.
Friends, you are my real soldiers, you are my real friends.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. This is a golden opportunity to bring the country to economic heights.
My young social friends, can you help me
You will know what the App is, you will know what the online banking means, you know what the banking facility is, you know what the tickets are registered through a variety.
These things are very simple for you, and you are using them too.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do is our dream of cashless society.
It is true that society without 100 cash transactions is not possible.
But why should we not start India as a less cash usage society
Once you start this low cash usage society, the goal of a cashless society will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never give me disappointment because we all have the desire to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know how many opportunities have been made today to create a cashless society, to introduce digital banking service or to introduce mobile banking service.
Each bank provides online facility.
Walt's direct object e-purse.
Various types of cards are available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, hundreds of crores of poor families have RuPay cards, very lowly used RuPay cards have started to be used after 8th and 300 percent has grown.
Like the prepaid card on the mobile phone, banks also get a prepaid card to spend money.
UPI is a prestigious platform to do business so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is so simple as you send information on the Wattsup.
He also knew how to send information to the Wattsup and how to work forward.
Not only this, technology is very simple to ensure that the big smart phones are all unnecessary for this work.
Money exchange can also be done through ordinary comfortable phone.
Walk worker, vegetable seller, milk seller, newspaper seller, tea seller and seller can use it without any difficulty.
I have stressed on efforts to make this method easier.
All the banks are engaged in this.
Now we have also canceled the additional fees for online business, and have come up with the end of all such taxes related to the card to strengthen the idea of a cashless society, which you may have seen in newspapers over the past 2-4 days.
My young friends, even after all this, this is uncertain for a generation.
I am aware that all of you are constructively associated with this great task.
WhatsApple's creative messages, shouts, poems, pieces, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter, all of you are taking care of.
I see what happens to me when I see the creativity of our youngsters in the midst of the challenges and the creation of the Gita was born at a time in the battlefield as the speciality of this Indian soil.
But my dear young friends, I once again tell you that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again tell you that I need your help, I believe that you and millions of youth of this country will do this work.
For the first time today, you will be part of a cashless society.
Give all the technology for online expenditure on your mobile phones.
You should take the lead in the Cashless Money Transfer Sociality, the disorder emanating from the net of notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to free the people from black money, the campaign to free the people from the problems of space.
Once you have learnt how the benefits of the RuPay card are available to the people, the poor will bless you.
Within a month, we can stand up as a new Hindustan, you can do this thing through your mobile phone.
Go to 10 houses every day, add 10 houses everyday.
I invite you to come, let us not only support you, but we will become the players of this transformation and make changes.
We will move forward in this war that will free the country from black money and corruption.
This country has created a big revolution.
My hearty youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to work on a social and personal basis for every school, college, university, NCC and NCWS programme.
We will take this task forward.
We all have an opportunity to serve the country with the best, we should not let this opportunity and this golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, Today, the birth anniversary of a great poet of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachan ji, on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai ji, Amitabh Bachchan ji gave a shout for the cleanliness movement.
You must have noticed that Amitabh ji, the most preferred artist of this century, has been taking forward the Swachhta Mission with great pace.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I offer my respectful bows to Harivansh Rai.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining the voice of Mann Ki Baat and for taking the cleanliness work forward and leading the path.
My dear countrymen, now through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your feelings, your letters, myGov and narendramodiap continue to connect me with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat (Mann Ki Baat) is a broadcast at 11 o'clock, but in the state languages, it will start soon after its completion.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The country of India is being celebrated for 365 days and at some corner of the country.
But it is a clear thing that we can see in all these things, this entire journey of the festivals of India, its expansion, its depth and its acceptance to the people, all these are linked to a fundamental mantra - to take individuality towards society.
Festivals are responsible for trees, trees, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
Now we celebrate the holidays on Sunday, but you must have noticed that the previous generation, whether it is working class or fishermen, they have observed the holidays on the full moon day of Amavasa.
Scientists have proved that on the day of purnamy, what kind of changes have made in sea water and what kind of effect is on nature.
It also affects the human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating vacations in our country also lives in collaboration with milestone and science.
Today, we celebrate the festival of Deepawali, as I said earlier, it is teaching and giving knowledge to every festival of ours.
This festival of Deepawali also gives us the message of Damaso Ma Jyotirgamaya, from darkness to light.
This is not merely the darkness caused by lack of light
The darkness of self-confidence, the darkness of inequality, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evils.
If we can get rid of the darkness of the individual and the darkness of the individual who has been sinked in the society by offering Deepavali Deepawali, this is the aim of spreading light on Deepawali Deepa.
One thing is well known to us, if we want to go to any corner of India, whether it is a rich house or a poor house or a well of the poor, on the occasion of Deepawali, you will see that the Swachhta movement is shining in every family.
Cleanliness is seen in every corner of the house.
The poor will have soil but Deepawali has come and he will keep his soil clean too.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali is sharing his film on the occasion of Deepawali.
The UK Prime Minister, on the occasion of Deepawali in London, organised a reception to connect all communities and participated in it
It can also be said that there is no UK city that does not celebrate Deepawali with great festivals.
Singapore's Prime Minister shared a film in Instagram with great pride for the world.
Do you know what the film is
The film is a film that is being worn by 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wearing Indian shoes and standing at the doors of the Parliament.
All these are made on the occasion of Deepawali.
I want to say that Deepawali is a glittering day and a big day that inspires people from darkness to light.
During the days of Deepawali, news about accidents, catastrophe and contemporary deaths are worried.
There is another difficulty - when doctors go to celebrate Deepawali with their families in large numbers due to Deepawali, there is another difficulty.
In particular, I appeal to parents and guardians that when children are slaughtered, there should be elders with them and that they should not face any fault and that they should not face any fault.
In our country, the festival of Deepawali is celebrated for many days.
This is not a day
It can be said in such a way that Govardham Puja, Bai Dhuj and Lap Panchami are long till the illuminating festival of Kartik Purnami, in a way it is a long time.
Besides, we are also happy to celebrate the festival of Deepawali and we are also engaged in the Mustips for the preparation of Chat Puja.
In the eastern part of India, the festival of Sath-Puja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but it is a special feature for it, it provides a great message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate that the Sun God gives us everything, from whom we reach everything, whether it is straight or indirect, and that God of Sun is blessed with us.
This sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers and the security forces is emotional in my mind.
I would like to share one thing from the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Deepawali to the security forces.
I have called upon the people to participate in a campaign called Sandesh2Soldiers, i. e.
I would like to bow down to the immense affection and pride of the soldiers of the country, and that there is no civilian who is not proud of the security forces.
Media has also turned this island festival into a day to thank the soldiers.
When we are in a morale, if we think of them then a new energy emerges for those memories.
One news also provides multiplied energy and the country has done it.
Some used to paint, clothed, made cartoons.
I can imagine how much this is a matter of pride for the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in Hashtag, Sandesh2 Soldiers.
I would like to read the poem sent by Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Ashwini ji writes: "I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, I celebrate the festival, I am happy, I smile, all this is because of you, I say today.
I convey my best wishes to you and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has sent me a telephone call as the soldiers are full of their birthplace and the soldiers are filled in their homes.
Let's hear what the soldiers want to say.
"Prime Minister, I speak Shiwani Mohan.
Their families and their wives, along with military officers and soldiers, make a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, the entire military society has also received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, the army brave is seen not only on the border but at every stage of life.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
He belongs to Padana, a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Our soldiers from the Indian Tibetan Border Force went to their village on holidays.
He also visited the village when there was a Panchayat and there was a discussion on the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
It was known that some families could not build toilets due to deficit.
Immediately, he took his check book and handed over a check-up of Rs. 57,000 to the Panchayat chief, giving 57 toilets to every family from my side, 57 toilets, keep the village of Padana free from the habit of open defecation.
Vikas Thakur ji has done this thing, he has given 1000 rupees to 57 families and has given a new energy to the Swachhta Mission.
This is the reason why Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of open defecation.
Similarly, I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing in Kerala.
Immediately, the decision was taken to build toilets in collaboration with NCC cadets, national welfare programmes and engineering students.
These students walked on their shoulders throughout the day and went to the jungle for all things like brick and cement for toilets.
They had constructed toilets in the village through their hard work and these youngsters were freed from the habit of defecation outside the small village in the far-flung forest.
This is the reason why Kerala has become an open state without defecation.
The state of Gujarat has announced that more than 150 cities are free from the habit of open defecation in all municipalities.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But usually these things are not focused on.
Old projects and new projects will be implemented and the next scheme will be expected and the same will be done.
In our country, the households in which there is gas connection, the households in which there is electricity, they do not need kerosene.
However, who is worried about the government, who is being given kerosene, who is providing gas and electricity, in such a situation, the middle class is getting the opportunity to make money.
Behold, there will be a big change, the black market will be stopped, the environment will benefit, our foreign exchange will be saved and the people will also be able to facilitate.
Yes, there is no doubt that intermediaries and non-moneys will suffer.
My fascinating countrymen, the Gandhians have always been our guide.
In every matter, his claim is to determine the standards of the country where to go and how to travel.
It is important for us to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps one after the other to get rid of the calamities.
Whatever our ancient thinking is, we must get rid of the society from the difference between men and women.
Now there are toilets for women and children in schools.
This is a good moment for our daughters to achieve the status of a diverse India.
Though vaccination is being done on the government side, even though lakhs of children are able to get rid of vaccination and target diseases.
The Mission Indradhanush vaccination campaign is being run for children who are free from vaccination, which provides children with the power to get rid of terrible diseases.
We are in the 21st century, but there is no longer a situation that darkness is surrounded by the village, and a big movement of electricity is successfully progressing in the village.
After so many years of independence, when the poor mother cooked food in the skin and 400 cigarettes smoke in her body, how would her health be
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and we are on the path of success.
Small traders, small entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers and finishers sell interest loans to the sellers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are the successful movements that have started getting rid of the interest lenders.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar, directly to the owners and beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of standards in the lives of the common man.
We fulfil our hearts with the memories of humanity and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab, pain touched my heart. "Prime Minister, greetings, sir, I speak from Punjab to Jasdeep.
Sir, on 31st October, Sardar Patel ji's birth anniversary.
Sardar Patel ji has worked to unite the country throughout his life and has achieved this goal and has united everyone.
On that day, Smt. Indira Gandhi ji was killed.
We all know well what happened in the country after that.
I want to know your views on how we prevent such unfortunate events.
My countrymen above my life, this pain is not just a man.
After Chanak, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel has done the work of integrating the country.
Sardar Patel ji tried to unite, because of his main objective of integrity, he was ruled by the anger of many, but the path of integration is no less easier than the goal.
However, on the birth anniversary of the same Sardar, thousands of Sardars and families of thousands of Sardars were killed after the murder of Smt. Indira Gandhi Ji.
On the day of the birth of the human being who spent his life for unity, the ruthlessness tied on the Sardars is paining all of us on one side of history.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move forward with the liberal mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
Although many languages, many castes, many garments, many food habits are diverse, the unity in diversity is the strength of India and the speciality of India.
Every generation has a duty and every government is responsible for exploring the opportunity for unity in every corner of our country and for promoting the principle of unity.
We are also away from divisive thoughts and divisive natures and the country will also be saved.
Sardar ji has given us a united India and it is our responsibility to make it a Shreshtha Bharat.
The basic mantra of integration is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar ji's journey of life started in the farmers' struggle.
He's a farmer's son.
Today we have heard the name of Amul.
Each thing of Amul is a good introduction to India and abroad.
But most people are aware that Sardar's vision has led to the formation of a milk producer cooperative trade union.
In 1942, he had strengthened this idea that the glittering Amul Institute, today is a living example of how Sardarji worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I pay my respectful tributes to Sardar.
We will remember Sardar ji wherever we are on the 31st October of the Integration Day.
My countrymen, on this occasion of Deepawali, Kartika Purnami is celebrated as a light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev ji's crystals are for the entire human society, not only spoken to India but also belongs to the entire human society, it still guides.
This is the message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji that is, service, opportunity, Sarbhad Da Bala i. e.
Peace, unity and harmony are the basic mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji had aimed at liberating the society from diversity, self-confidence and evil habits.
May your dreams and your commitments succeed in all ways.
In the past, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country who have been killed by a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir.
I pay my tributes to all the brave and brave soldiers.
This desperate event has driven the entire country.
Sadness increases in the nerves of the people of the country, anger bursts
This loss is not only for the families of those who lost their children, who lost their brothers, who lost their husband.
The entire country is suffering from this loss.
Therefore, people of the country, today I tell you what I have said before you that criminals will be punished, they cannot escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our army.
They will break every environment with their bravery, and 125 crore people of the country will showcase their valour in the way of living peacefully and peacefully.
We are very proud of our army.
Today, especially I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemies of the country well.
At this time when they are beginning to understand the truth, they have started traveling on a peaceful path away from such destructive forces.
Every parents wish that schools and colleges should start functioning at a fast pace.
Over the past few days, business has started well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be a solution to our problems, our progress can be a path of development.
For our future generations, we must take new heights of development.
I am confident that if we pursue peaceful discussions and resolve every issue, then we can provide a better way to the future generations of Kashmir.
Responsibilities of the security management of the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to ensure that the capabilities, powers, laws and regulations that we have are utilised for law and order, they are only ensuring the peaceful lives of the common man of Kashmir and follow them well.
Sometimes those who think different from our views present new ideas.
Shershvardhan, who is a student of 11th class, has given me a different idea.
After the real extremist attack, my mind was overwhelmed by anxiety, and there was a debate in my mind to do something, but I did not get any way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, I am happy to note that you have thought positively in such a young age in this very zealous environment.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value for the anger of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feelings of the people of the country.
Yes, you have introduced a positive approach.
But you know that during the war that took place in 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had presided over the country.
Every citizen had a pledge to do something in his mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji tried to give this feeling of the country a very good year.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the people of the country to work for the service of the nation.
Every citizen must understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of the bombings, which Lal Bahadur Shastri presented.
While Gandhians were guiding the freedom struggle, when the freedom struggle was very strong, he successfully worked in encouraging the creative work of the society when the movement needed another platform.
When we and our army fulfill our duties, those who are responsible for the administration, let our countrymen and every citizen contribute to this spirit of patriotism, then the country will surely take new heights.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who took part in the Para Olympic Games is a victory of human inspiration.
Varun Vishwanathan ji has registered on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have worked very well and asked you to tell it in the voice of your mind.
Not only for your two, but also for every citizen of the country, there has been a spiritual link with the sportspersons who participated in Para Olympics.
Beyond the sports, this Para Olympic Games and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the attitude of humanitarian perspective and disabled.
I will never forget the words that our sister Deepa Malik ji has won after winning the medal in my life.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women of our country, participated in Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports, while playing with disabled persons, their talent in sports and sports is a bigger thing - psychological and determination.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won the gold medal in the heightlifting event.
Mariyappan has lost his right leg at the age of just five.
Poverty could not stop his satisfaction.
He is not a big city resident, not a middle class family or a rich family.
At the age of 21, he has given medals, not only to suffer from physical distress, but also to help in consolidation.
While they have raised our feelings, they have also changed the perspective of seeing the disabled.
Can anybody imagine that the disabled can dissolve the replacement of customary Olympic competitions
This time it happened.
Abdul Ladip Pakher from Algeria, who won the gold medal in the Olympics Competition for 1500 metres.
I once again express my heartfelt congratulations to these sportspersons and say that in the coming days, India will move towards making an excellent plan for the development of Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very unique experience in Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
The Government of India has organised a Mega Camp for Divyangjans, in which many world records have been created.
I had to meet a small girl who had no eye-sight there. She was named after Gauri Shardul - a small child who came from the longest forest area of Nang district.
She told me some parts of it, when I told me to accept it before the People's Council, the people were surprised.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a world record in Navsari.
600 disabled persons who have no access to listening instruments have been conducted within 8 hours.
This is placed in Kinnas World Record Book.
It is a matter of great pride to the people of our country that three world achievements are being achieved by Divyangjans in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission.
On that day I would have remembered that cleanliness should become our natural, it should be the duty of every citizen and it should be seen as a scavenger.
I am sure that when the 2nd anniversary of the 2nd of October is going to be completed, I am sure that the heart of the 125 crore people of the country has become aware of cleanliness.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take one step in accordance with the saying that we will take one step towards cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have moved towards cleanliness.
If the direction of going is correct then it is proved that the result will be very good.
Whether it is a common citizen or a ruler or a government office or a road or a bus or a railway station or a school or a college or a hospital or a hospital or adolescents, the poor, farmers and women of the village have made their contribution for cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a positive job.
This progress is not sufficient, we have to progress even more.
This is very important
This is the reason why when we talk about rural India, 2 crore 48 lakhs i. e.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of open defecation will be finalized soon.
When I had recently visited the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, the officers had told me about the date of 2nd October, which will be the day of the end of the open defecation.
Come, people, let us see the progress of voice potatoes.
Today, especially my young brothers and sisters are fully using technology and I want to present a scheme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone number of 1969 to know how the Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You can fully use it, especially the younger generation.
The Government of India urges the corporate world to come forward and make your contribution.
Young professionals who want to work for cleanliness support the professionalism.
We can use them as Swachh Bharat Fellows, Swachh Bharat Fellows across the districts.
This Swachh Bharat Mission cannot progress if it stands with the governments, it cannot be achieved naturally and it cannot be completed.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the cleanliness drive, we should also move towards the direction of defecation to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been asked to buy compost fertilizers from the waste.
They should find ways to get this fertilizer for the farmers who want to be engaged in natural farming.
Whoever thinks of enhancing the wealth of his land, who is interested in the welfare of the land, whoever has a substantial impact on chemical fertilizers, they should be given this fertilizer even if they need this fertilizer.
Amitabh Bachan ji is contributing to this work as a business ambassador.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, city mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to have deeper discussions on cleanliness.
What can be achieved by technology
What can be the financial model
All these things are being discussed.
I am watching that there is a constant innovation of cleanliness news.
I read in a newspaper that one day students of Gujarat Technology University have gone to 107 villages and worked to create awareness about the construction of toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a schedule for one year in its ministries.
Each sector has to focus on cleanliness for 15 days.
The three sectors of the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Health, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development will be jointly implementing Swachhta programmes in their respective governance boundaries from 1st to 15th October, 2018.
In the last two weeks of the month of October, 3 more Ministries of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs, from 16th to 31st October, will undertake Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective governance boundaries.
If you have any work related to these sectors then I urge the citizens to join it.
Now you must have noticed that the Swachhta-related research campaign is going on.
Initially, 73 cities were conducted to study how cleanliness was done and it was done before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now their system, in every city and in every city, we have a hope to progress the next time.
There is a competitive environment related to cleanliness.
We have to contribute to this movement as much as the citizens can contribute.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of Gandhijis and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be held.
It has been two years since the Swachh Bharat Mission.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I have been urging you to buy some trashes.
I once again urge every family to buy some jewels and light will burn in the houses of the poor on the day of Deepawali.
On Sunday, October 2, as a citizen, can we not take any action related to cleanliness
I urge you to join you in the cleanliness work for 2 hours and 4 hours physically and share a photograph with me on the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With the efforts of all of us, this movement will once again be strengthened throughout the country and will give a new impetus.
We will re-imagine the Gandhians and Lal Bahadur Sastri, and we will have a desire to do something for the country.
In the past, the responses given by the people of the country to my request to eradicate the gas subsidy are very inspiring for the livelihood of the country.
This is a campaign to collect food items and clothing for the people who are required.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers landed on the streets and received the old sports items in the family and brought them to Anganwadi in the poor residential area.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji explained to those political ideas that are being motivated and served by millions of workers like me.
The centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, who gave the political ideals related to the roots of India, the idea of respecting the tradition of Indian culture, the musical political principle and humanitarian philosophy of that trend, starts today.
His contribution to Sarvajan Hitai, Sarvajan Sukkai, the welfare of all and the happiness of all.
The Gandhians also spoke about the interests of the people in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal presented the entire economic project in one word that work for every hand, water on every ground.
The country must celebrate his birth centenary as the welfare year of the poor.
The focus of all the attention of the society and the government should be on how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I remember Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji, who was a fool of our thoughts, who was a thought of all of us.
The common man of this country is inspiring me.
What are the aspirations of the common man of this country
Registration of the common man in my mind and mind has come out in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I express my views and express my heartfelt gratitude to Akashwani for making all efforts to bring it to all languages.
They wrote letters after the voice of Mann Ki Baat, gave suggestions, putting the doors of the government, showing light on the grievances of the government, making special programmes with such letters, calling representatives from the government party and setting up a platform for solution to problems.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat does not stop with a 15-20 minute conversation, which has become a new opportunity for social transformation.
What is more pleasant than that
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to this success and I salute them.
My friendly countrymen, next week Navaratri, Durga Puja and Vijaya Dasami will come and arrangements for Deepawali will start and in a way there is a different environment throughout the country.
This is the time for energy emotion and the unity of society is the power of the country.
Whether it becomes Navaratria or Durga Puja, we think of making this power a way to social unity.
To take the country to new heights, we will take the ideas of peace, unity and harmony and follow the holy days of Navratri and Durga Puja.
We will celebrate Vijaya Dasami as a success gathering.
This day is being celebrated as National Sports Day throughout the country.
During the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he has performed a valuable role in obtaining gold medals for India.
At that time there was only 10 minutes to get the end.
Thyaan Chand ji put three shells in those ten minutes, and I put a shell in response to the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever it comes to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there are several suggestions in mygov or narendramodiap.
They are varied.
This time, however, I had the maximum demands that I must comment on Rio Olympics.
I see this kind of interest in the public minds of Rio Olympics, this kind of awareness and the pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it is very positive.
Even beyond the cricket, the people of India have so much interest in other sports, so much awareness and information.
Sachin has written, "You have a request, this time you talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmar in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
One of these women belongs to North India, one from South India, one from East India and the other from the corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of making the country proud.
On the MyGov website, Shikhar Dagur ji has written that we can work even better in the Olympics.
He further said, My best wishes to you all for the two medals we have won in Rio, Honble Moti sir.
There is a need to make a long journey in sports.
Our parents are focusing on education today.
Even in the society, sports are still seen with the point of view of time.
We need to change this idea.
There is a need to encourage the society.
Who can do this work better than you
Likewise, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra also wrote in the narendramodiap - insisted on the need for extra curriculum activities at the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In a way, the same feeling reflected in thousands of books.
It is true that we are not able to work according to our opponents.
We have got two medals in the medal.
But if you do not get medals, you can see that for the first time, the sportspersons of India have shown significant talent in many matters.
In the shooting segment, our Abinav Bindra ji got the fourth position and lost the medal in a very small difference.
Likewise, Shania Mirza-Rohan took place in the Tennis competition.
We have worked well in the athletics sector.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar eligibleed for the last trick field.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have succeeded in getting the knock out position in the hockey competition.
Vikas Krishna Yadav came to the final stage in Baxing, but he could not get the bronze medal.
Many soldiers, such as Athiti Ashoka, Dattu Bognal and Athanu Das, were well-known.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have worked till now, we may have to get disappointed again.
I have announced the formation of a group.
The Government of India will wash it deeply and will consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action Plan will be devised on what we can work well in the field.
We have to formulate our programmes with a vision of 2020, 2025, 2028.
I appeal to all Indian citizens interested in sending your suggestions to me on the narendramodiap.
Let the State Governments send their suggestions after discussions.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I could learn a lot with these small boys.
For me, the 5th of September is not only the Teachers' Day, but also the Education Day.
But this time I have to go to the G20 Summit, it seems that today my feelings will not be expressed in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The more important place Mother has in life, the more important is the place of teachers.
We have seen teachers more interested in us than we.
They dedicated their lives for their disciples, for their students.
Today I see Gopichand ji as a best teacher beyond being a sportsperson.
On Teacher's Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand for his penance, for his full commitment towards sports and for his enjoyment in the victory of his brothers.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
Birthday of Sarvepalli Radhakrishna
He has always tried to live himself as a teacher, even though he has attained any condition in his life.
Not only this, he never dies a student in a good teacher.
The books and citations that he read in that month would have been seen in it.
The whole month I have done that is not correct in his sight.
Anything even today is like teaching me in his classroom.
Even today, he is giving me remote education in a way.
When I see his signature at the age of 90 and his signature, I am surprising how he can write so many pearls in this pure age
Because my signature is so bad that if someone has written beautifully then my mind will be very respected.
Your experience may also be like my experience.
Whatever benefits you have received from your teachers in your life, you will tell the world that if we see the teachers then there will be a change in the perspective and a pride.
It is our responsibility to enhance the dignity of teachers in society.
If you are taking a picture with your teachers, if there is an event with your teacher, then you must share your ideas related to your teachers in the narendramodiap.
It is a valuable thing to see the contribution of the teachers of the country in the eyes of the students.
But when we talk about Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to return our memories to Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The tradition of celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi socially is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak.
He transformed the event of time through the Ganesh rally into a day of national awareness and made it a social cultural day.
Ganesh Chaturthi was a discussion on all the questions that touched social life, which led to a new rise in society and a new development.
Not only this, he has given a mantra - Swarajya should be the focal point of our birth and the freedom struggle must get strength.
Not only in Maharashtra, but also today, Ganesh Chaturthi is not being celebrated socially all over the country.
They are discussing public matters, conducting columns, conducting competitions for the goal.
The scenes will be artistically illuminated by touching the society.
In a way, the campaign to create awareness for all is being run through socially developed Ganesh Chaturthi.
Lokmanya Tilak Swarajya has given the mantra of our birth anniversary.
But now we are in a free India.
Come on, I'm calling you.
Celebrations are true in the powers of society.
They provide a new life to individuals and society.
Life is not possible without celebrations but it has to be changed according to the requirement of time.
I can see that this time many people have written about Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja.
They are worried about the environment.
Shri Shankarnarayan Prashanth Ji, Moti Ji has called upon you to understand Mann Ki Baat statues made by Plaster of Paris through Mann Ki Baat programme.
He also said that the idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not suitable for the environment, and many others have just expressed their concerns.
I urge all of you to use the idols of the children made of soil or the statues of Durga to restore our ancient tradition.
Ganesh is the one who removes the problems.
In such a situation, we should not create a Ganesha statue that makes it difficult.
I don't know how you will take what I say, but I didn't just say that, many people say that.
An architect of Pune, Shri Abijit Totbale, Nisark Mitra, Vikyan Prabodini, Nisark Kata of Vidarpa, Gyan Prabodini of Pune, Kirgavasa Raja of Mumbai.
Such a variety of organisations and individuals have a lot of difficulty in building idols of clay, and campaigning for them.
Ganesh Chaturthi is also a social service that does not pollute the environment.
Durga Puja has a little more time.
The family of traditional idols will get employment through such mud statues
We will resolve to protect the environment because our ponds and rivers will be made from the soil of the rivers.
It is natural for all the people of the country to be proud that when Mother Teresa, who has served for the poor of India, is now being given a holy degree.
Every moment we have got the privilege of learning something or the other from the saints, sages, sages and great men.
We have got something from them, we are learning and understanding the good things.
My dear countrymen, when progressive thirst is a movement, it will make a big change.
Jan Shakti Mahesan is seen as Shakti.
The Government of India, in collaboration with the five State Governments in the past, has been engaged in a successful effort to clean the Ganga and clean the Ganga.
We invited the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the River Ganga to meet in Allahabad on 20th this month.
And they had men, and women.
I extend my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India for fulfilling this great work.
I am extremely grateful to the Chief Ministers of the five State Governments who have helped in connecting the Jan Shakti and taking an important step towards the pollution of Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things, sometimes touch my heart, sometimes there is a great respect in my mind for those who create an opportunity.
On 15th July, more than 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh have been covered with 1.
More than 25 lakh students have written letters to their parents socially.
Some had mentioned in English, some in Hindi and some in the language of Chhattisgarh that there should be toilet in their homes in a letter to their fathers.
They had demanded that the toilet be constructed, some children had written that even if you didn't celebrate my birthday this year, you wouldn't be happy, but you would definitely build a toilet.
This work was done by children from seven to 17 years of age.
Mallamma, a 16-year-old girl in Kopal district of Karnataka, has made a Satyagraha against her family.
And he did not do anything for himself, neither did he make good garments, nor eat sweets.
The grip of the daughter-in-law Mallamma is because we need a toilet in our house.
Look at the importance of the village leader Mohammad Shafi, he arranged for Rs. 18,000 and had given toilets within a week.
But everybody is connected to it in some way, everybody is playing a golden role.
I also invite the TV channels to make such short films and organise competitions.
There is no need for big studio and big cameras to produce a film.
In today's time, you can make a film using your mobile phone camera.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurated a new event called Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Many people can question that the President of India should launch a radio channel.
Bangladesh is our neighbour
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal have enhanced the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Badar radio are beyond the boundaries, and the people of Bengali language from both sides will be happy to listen to Akashwani.
Akashwani's great contribution to connecting people with the people.
The President has inaugurated this.
I express my gratitude to the country of Bangladesh associated with us for fulfilling this task.
I also congratulate the friends of Akashwani for their contribution in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, you must have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I am also a man like you
Therefore, sometimes my mind also gets wet by touching some emotional events.
Such emotional events provide new energy and new ideas, which inspire the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me just a few days ago touched my heart.
It was written by a mother about 84 years old
If the retired teacher had not asked him not to mention his name, I would have mentioned him.
I have also forgotten the subsidies that you have asked you to push the gas subsidy.
I believe that the letter written by the Prime Minister of India for me is similar to the Padma Shri Award.
Friends, You will be aware of the fact that I have tried to write a letter from my side to all those who have pushed the gas subsidy and I have tried to go and give it to those who have pushed the subsidy.
It is my endeavor to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have been unhappy because of last year's drought, but in August this year it has given the sorrow of continuous floods.
Floods have occurred in some parts of the country again.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the local organisations, the Social Welfare Organisations and the citizens have made unbreakable efforts.
But some of the tragic acts in the midst of floods are reminded of.
In August this year, we will remind us of what the energy of living together, what will be the result of shoulder to shoulder with all.
In August 2016, the newly resisted political parties, 90 parties from all over the country, and all the political parties in the Parliament, passed the law on Goods and Services Tax.
Congratulations to all political parties for the completion of this.
This is a glorious example of what will be the benefit of all political parties traveling together in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country together discussed the issue of Kashmir in a single voice about the situation in Kashmir.
Through this news was published to the world and to the separatist forces and their understanding was expressed to the people of Kashmir.
After interacting with all political parties about Kashmir, one thing emerged very well and in two words, if I say that I should suppress it, they are unity and affection.
These two words were mixed with their basic mantra.
Whether it is the life of a young man or the lives of the security forces, the losses are ours, the losses are ours, the confidence of all of us, the confidence of the 125 crore people of the country, the confidence of the villagers and the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who predict small children to create unrest in Kashmir, but one day they should have answered the unrest.
I believe in the 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I got the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi and I believe that the inspiration for sports across the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every young man in the coming days.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh Mela of World Games is going to be held in a few days.
The word Rio continues to revive in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a wonderful arrangement of running for Rio drive, playing, living, playing and developing.
In the days to come, in any part of the country, we will take part in something to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of India is ready to make your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let's do everything that we all can honour every sportsperson in the days to come.
Today, when I was talking about Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from the Central University of Punjab.
Like him, many other poets may have written more poems in this regard, some may have become songs and songs in every language, but today I would like to share with you the poems that Suraj ji wrote to me.
Gold shall be of silver brass for medal.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons and I extend my best wishes to all of you for flying our flag in Rio with great pride.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam ji is named, a future picture of Skill India in the form of science, technology and missile is shadowed in our eyes
In the same way, what is your government trying to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam Ji
Besides, if we want to make our way musical, we must do research and innovations, this is the life of technology.
If researches and innovations have not been created, the way the old odour starts flowing in the stored water, the technology will become a burden for us.
If we depend on ancient technologies without research and innovation, we will become eternal in the changing era
Therefore, the government is making several efforts to sow the milk country of science, technology and the fascination of research in the minds of our youngsters.
That's why I say let us aim to innovate, let us aim to create innovations.
When I say that I am AIM, it means Atal Innovation Mission.
If we want to create next generation innovators then we should connect our adults with this scheme.
Therefore, the Government of India has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakh rupees will be provided and more than 10 lakh rupees will be provided for maintenance in five years where such software centres are being set up in schools.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre with Innovation is directly connected.
If we have a powerful, incubation centre, we get a necessary institution to create innovations, to conduct tests for start-ups and to stabilize them.
It is important to set up a new Centre, while strengthening old centres is also important.
Our daily life has problems in our eyes.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generation of the country to take the help of technology, research, innovate and solve the problems of your eyes.
The Government of India wants to give a special prize to the familiar technologies to solve our problems.
It is a matter of great pleasure that when we talk about the Tinkering Lab, more than 13000 schools have applied, and when we talk about the Centre for Creation, more than 4000 NGOs have come forward to set up such centres.
I believe that the real tribute to Abdul Kalam is to research, innovation, to find solutions through technology and to simplify our calamities to the problems that we face in our daily life.
This will be the true tribute to Abdul Kalam's memories that our younger generations are focusing on these things and their role in building a modern India of the 21st century.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we had been worried about famine in our minds and now the rain has been enjoying the joy of the rain and the floods have also been reported.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the flood victims.
Even though there are some hurdles due to rains, there is growth in every human mind, because there is rain and agriculture as the centre of all our economic activity.
Sometimes, diseases that make us sad for life are also causing us to suffer.
If we are awake, if we are awake, if we are a pilgrimage, then the ways to escape from them are easier.
Let's take dengue fever.
We can save us from dengue fever.
I appeal to all of you that despite all the work done by the government, hospitals and doctors, we should not allow dengue to be allowed in our homes, in our regions, in our families, there should not be any disease that can be caused by water.
My dear countrymen, I would like to return your attention to another issue.
Life has become urgent and faster, at some points we cannot even think about us.
If you want a few hours, you can get relief, but you should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without consultation.
There is another problem - if the doctor recommends taking 15 antibiotic pills in 5 days, please finish the number of physicians in that recommendation.
And if we leave half of the necessity that we don't need anymore because we have become healthy, then they become profitable to microbes and become stronger.
We call it antibiotic resistance in medical terms, so the quantity of antibiotic and how to be used is important, as well as the regulations taken by them are important.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You must have noticed that the antibiotic medicinal plants which are now sold are scattered on the bed of a red colour, it is to make you aware, focus on it.
When we talk about health, I would like to add one more thing to it.
The health of pregnant mothers in our country is a matter of great concern at times.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country conceive, but some mothers die during pregnancy and some children die during pregnancy.
Sometimes both mother and child have to die.
In the last decades, the decline in the maternal mortality rates is true, but even today we cannot save the lives of pregnant mothers more.
During pregnancy and after delivery, deficiency of blood, infections related to delivery, high blood pressure, etc.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maternity Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Abhiyan - Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Yojana.
My medical brothers and sisters cannot dedicate themselves to this task for the poor for 12 days a year
In the past, many people have written to me.
I believe that you will definitely join you in this.
My dear countrymen, today the concern of climate change, global climate change and environment is being raised all over the world.
Discussions are being held between the people of the country and the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In the song Lord Krishna, Ashwat: Sarvavrukshanam, that is, I am a royal tree in the trees.
It is said that there is no vegetation that has no medicinal quality through Sukranio, Nasti.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, has attracted my attention, this has yearned my heart.
It is said that on the Mahabharata mountain, trees also perform the obligations of Makatselva in the heavens, Sonal has accepted the challenge of fulfilling the wishes of his parents, not only the wishes of his parents, but also the aspirations of the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahadre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several such efforts are being made.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pedestrians coming to the Amba Devi temple there.
Once a social service organisation provides a prasad of tree plantation to those who visit the temple, mother-in-law will continue to give you their blessings.
Hundreds of thousands of pedestrians have been given trees that year.
Even temples can start the tradition of providing trees in the rainy season instead of prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement related to tree walking.
I once again ask my farmer brothers why should we not plant pine trees instead of planting trees with trees on the borders of our crops
Today, in India, we have to import the united tree from abroad for manufacturing things like housing and chairs.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert area.
Even there, a big number of Van Mahotsav has been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing to plant 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know how big this is a challenge.
It has been decided to increase greenery by 50 by 2029 in Andhra Pradesh.
Even in Gujarat, Van Mahotsav is a very popular tradition.
In Gujarat this year, several schemes like Manmar forest, Ekta forest and Shaheed forest have been set up, in which several crores of tree plants have been planted.
International agreements are being signed in several fields such as diplomatic diplomacy, trade discussions, defence dialogues, etc.
But for me, the visit to South Africa is in a way similar to a pilgrimage.
It is natural to remember Gandhians and Nelson Mandela while thinking about South Africa.
When the words of Ahimsa, love and forgiveness come to the ears, the faces of Gandhians and Mandela will be seen before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to go to the Phoenix settlement, the place where Gandhians lived is known as Sarvodaya.
I got the opportunity to travel to that Peter Maritzburg railway station when Gandhijis travelled in the train and seeds to transform Mohandas into Gandhians.
This time I have got the opportunity to meet many important people who sacrificed their young age for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years in prisons with him.
In a way, they sacrificed their entire youth, and I got a great deal of visiting great men close to Nelson Mandela, Ahmed Katada ji, Laloo (FEBA) Siba ji, George Besos ji Ronnie Casres.
When I was talking to them, when I was asking their prison experiences, no bitterness was seen in their minds, no bitterness was seen.
The feeling of everyone is equal and everyone is our way to bring us to a bright future.
Let us also take pride in reflecting these Indians who have lived in the basic mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a newspaper that a lady Sikh on a fraud and email network lost 11 lakh rupees and finally committed suicide.
I am very sorry about the status of a woman and her family.
I want to know what your opinion is about such fraudulent emails.
A new strategy that is using technology is spreading all over the world.
The way technology plays a major role in the economic system, its misuse is also increasing.
It was mentioned that at the time of retirement, when the daughter's marriage was completed, one day a small money came for a person living in her own house, you got a big honor from abroad, and if you want to get it, then put 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the customs settlement, and the person who had suffered from his life without thinking about anything, took 2 lakh rupees and sent it to a person who did not know the name of the face.
Whoever wants to make a fake letter pap and send it through it, get your credit card number and debit card number and cleans your bank account through technology.
This is a new kind of fraud, it is a digital fraud.
I believe that we should protect us from this confrontation, I want to be awakened and if such letters come, we should immediately share them with our friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the continuation of the Parliament session.
I had a pleasant experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar came and met me.
The enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiasiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiastic enthusiasticity
They brought the films that have beautified Aligarh railway station with them.
They had built a layer garden with plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new shape for the station.
If you have the opportunity to go to Aligarh, you must go to the railway station.
Now I have the color of such information about several railway stations in India and people from those regions are charming on the walls of the railway stations with their art gallery.
You can feel a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can transform through participation.
My best wishes to all those working in the country, especially to my friends of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country with rainy season.
You will also participate in festivals in your homes and releases.
The festival of Raksha Bandhan is very important.
Like last year, this year, during Raksha Bandhan, will you not be able to present the country's mothers and sisters as a gift of Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Life Insurance Yojana
Brothers and sisters, Take a gift that your sister really feels safe in life.
Whether we have cooked food in our homes or we have placed a woman or she is the daughter of a poor mother.
During this Rakshabandhan festival, can they also get Pradhan Mantri Ayurveda Suraksha Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Ayurveda Yojana gift
My dear countrymen, many of us will be born after the independence of the country.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom Day is not the event of the governments, it should be for the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we must celebrate this day as our festival.
I want to do something positive with the idea of patriotism.
I would like to invite you to the people of the country to make it clear from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I do not want to have the ideas of the Prime Minister from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
The ramparts of the Red Fort should be given the feelings of 125 crore people.
Many people are planning several events on holidays.
Awareness has spread in many villages
Somebody told me a few days ago that Hivre Bajar Gram Panchayat of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and the people of the village have solved the problem of water in a sensitive manner.
There may be a lot of villages who want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, the entire cropping pattern has changed the farming system.
They have decided that the crop that uses excessive water, whether it is black or banana, should not produce such crops.
Anything is easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
But you see my farmer brothers and you don't want much water for sugarcane and you have left it immediately.
They cultivate fruits and vegetables throughout the country, that is, they only cultivate that which requires minimum amount of water.
They have succeeded in their own endeavour to address the water problem through several initiatives such as sparks, drops of water irrigation, rain water harvesting, water recharging, i. e.
Well, I have spoken about Hivre Bazar, a small village, but there may be many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to the villagers and for the excellent work you have achieved.
Someone told me about the Gorwa Gorva Gram Panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
I think that when the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains, it becomes a news for the world.
It is human nature to feel that if there is a good news from somewhere and if there is any problem then the entire problem is lost.
I feel a joyful news from the news that this time there is a possibility of 106 to 110 of the rainfall.
Despite the rainy season, news of good rainy season has also been refreshed.
But my dear countrymen, as much enjoys the good rainfall, it also provides opportunities and challenges.
Can we not even start the campaign to save water from the village
Farmers need soil and it helps them in crops.
Why should we not put the soil in the lakes of the villages in far-flung fields
While the soil resource of the fields grows, the level of water storage will also increase
What if you fill the stones and soil in empty cement bags and empty fertilizer bags and put it on the way to water
Whenever I tell you one thing, whenever we go to Borbandar, the birthplace of Annal Gandhiji, we can see various places there, one of them is one thing to see.
That is, it is important to know how the ponds were built under the house 200 years ago to store water and how clean the water is.
His concern is very natural, because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come, several schemes have been created and money has been spent due to which such a question is being raised in the minds of crores of people in the country as brother Kumar Krishna.
Those who have faith in time consider the Ganga as a householder.
The Ganga is the only one who works for us and the Ganga is the one who gives us the power to live.
The way the flow of Ganga is melting, the economic activity of the country gets a momentum.
One participant brought the Ganges to us, but crores of devotees are required to protect it.
We cannot succeed in the work without peoples participation, so we must become a change agent for cleanliness and hygiene.
We must repeat this thing and remember it.
Several efforts are being made on the government side.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation in all the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to integrate social and cleanliness related institutions.
Several steps have been taken to surface cleaning, clean the area and prevent industrial pollution.
Every day, solid waste is being mixed through the canals.
In the coming days, the projects that will remove the waste and apply the machine will be implemented in many more places, the people living on the banks of the Ganges will soon experience the benefits.
I feel that it will also have good results.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the dwellings in the states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in the past few days in terms of ero Liquid Discharge i. e.
The expulsion of black liquor from the paper factories has almost been finalized.
This shows us that we are traveling in the right direction and there has been an increase in awareness.
Anybody from the far southern coast of the Ganges is surely asking whether the Ganga is not clean or not.
This is the belief of the people that will definitely bring success in cleaning the Ganga.
People are offering donations to clean the Ganga.
This system is being implemented in a very beautiful manner.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
We celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April, today on 24th April, we are celebrating Panchayat Raj Day.
This is a good thing that happens accidentally, since the birth anniversary of the Honble President of India gave us the Constitution, this is a concept of connecting the largest constituent villages of the Constitution, the Government of India has undertaken the mission of Grameodayam to Bharat Udayam for ten days from 14th April to 24th April in collaboration with State Governments.
Today, on 24th April, I will celebrate Panchayat Raj Diwas in Jharkhand, where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live, this movement has created a massive awareness.
How to strengthen the democratic systems at the village level in every corner of India
How to make villages self-reliant
How will the villages embrace their own development plans
Several events in many villages of India may have been held in 10 days, which would have been less than that.
I convey my best wishes to all the State Governments and the villagers who have used it as an opportunity for the development of the villages for the benefit of these days in an innovative manner.
There has been awareness in the villages that is the guarantee for Indian emergence.
The foundation of Bharat Uday is in the village rise
Therefore, we all are focusing on the development of the village and we will get the desired benefits.
For the past several years, development has been needed in the education sector.
Today, if there is one of the first dreams of parents in every family then it is important to provide quality education to the children.
The idea of home, vehicle etc. is all later.
This feeling is very strong in the minds of the people of India.
Therefore, I appeal to my parents to all, take some time in detail to the children and talk about the practices of the schools.
If you get up in mind, go to school and send yourself to teachers.
This awareness should be the contribution of the people to reduce the numerous shortcomings of our education system.
All the governments in our country have focused on education and every government has made its own efforts.
It is true that there is a considerable time for our people to set up academic institutions, expand the educational system, establish schools, colleges, faculty and maximum children to go to school.
In a way, the effort to spread education has become the primary one, it is also important.
But the importance of extension is more important than that of our educational system.
We have done the biggest task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our main aim is to provide good education now through the education campaign for all.
What is the truth that we have to make a long journey.
But if we decide 125 crore people then a long journey will also be possible.
We need to make fundamental changes according to Sharma ji.
Indias Universities should also become a globally competitive university.
The importance of education, the importance of skills, the role of technology in education is going to be immense.
I am confident that far-flung education and technology will simplify our education and in a short span of time the results of it will start appearing in the eyes.
Prime Minister, I speak from Bijnor to Mona Karnawal.
In today's times, along with education, sports is also very important for the youth.
They must have a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader and a good leader, and they will have a complete development.
I say this through my experience, because I am in the Indian Commonwealth Organisation, this has a good effect on my life.
It required greater integration.
Their widespreadness gave me the hearts of the people and they were very enthusiastic and have to do something.
I know that once I was in the National Students Force, I have a new perspective and a national perspective is being created through such institutions.
I have experienced the benefits of my childhood, I have to fill up a new energy in these organisations and give a new impetus.
This time I have kept some things in front of them.
In this season, I heard why our youngsters and all the organizations should not be engaged in great work for water conservation.
How many rounds and how many districts we can stop the open defecation.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about this thing that we all have to think about.
I also see this astonishing thing.
You will know how much the party would provide gas cylinders was a matter of discussion in the last several elections, that the political situation of our country was.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing to reduce subsidies, which led to a number of groups being formed and gave suggestions and decisions on subsidies cuts.
Several crores of rupees have been spent on the implementation of these groups.
But today my heart gets bored with the pride of my countrymen.
But if you see the account, more than 80 percent of these million people went to the suppliers themselves, standing in line, giving their subsidies in writing.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives a slight discount on any tax, then the government will be felicitated on television and newspapers throughout the week.
Because they are forced to think political leaders in a new perspective.
Even this incident has put the country's economists in a new perspective to think.
Even for the world's economists presenting a variety of possibilities, this is an event beyond their thinking.
We must think about it at some point.
It is an extraordinary thing that the abandonment of subsidy of one crore families, the availability of gas cylinders to one crore poor families instead of them, the balance of one crore households due to drifting subsidies, even if it looks simple when it looks upwards, it shows how much it can be achieved when people believe and act.
I urge all the political leaders to believe in the people wherever we go.
You have the benefits you can't even think.
We have to move in this direction.
For instance, in my mind, somehow I thought why the third and fourth level workers should conduct direct examinations and why we should not believe in their examination assessments.
I don't want to announce that there will be no ticket checkers on some train lines.
Let us believe in the people of the country, we can do many such tests.
Once we trust the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by political leaders but by one crore families of the country.
A person named Ravi has written a letter to me - Good News day, good damage every day and tell your officials about a good thing every day.
The bad news in every newspaper and the media is breaking news.
Is there no good thing going on in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a letter had also sent to me that we would not even release a bad news on Monday and publish a positive news.
It is true that there has been an atmosphere of positive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to everyone.
Whatever a well-known person gives an excellent information, however beautiful it speaks through words, however, in an artificial manner, it gets more benefits through good news.
Good news becomes a concept of good work.
Truth is that the extent we strengthen the benefit, the way we reduce the place for evils.
If we take the lamp, the darkness will depart on its own, and surely go away.
You can also participate in it.
Ravi ji, you have given a good advice but please do not get angry with me.
Let us work together in constructive efforts, talk positively and take part in the efforts to bring positive things.
The Kumbh Mela is a specialty of our country.
Kumbh Mela can be the center of tourism attraction.
Several people of the world have been unaware of the fact that millions of people come and gather on the banks of the river for days.
Festival will commemorate in peaceful mind and peaceful environment.
These events are systematically achieving greater standards as a peoples participation in programme management.
I have been watching the films related to the Simhastha Kumbh Mela for the past two days.
I want the tourism sector of the Government of India and the tourism departments of the state governments to organise a photography competition.
You can urge people to welcome the best pictures.
This can definitely be done.
In the meantime, when the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me, he told me that special attention has been given to cleanliness.
The objective of Swachhta is not only in this festival but also in the minds of the people from there to the idea of cleanliness.
While I accept that Kumbh is a festival related to spirituality, I believe that it can also become a social opportunity.
How can we enhance our love on water, how can we enhance water and we use the Kumbh Mela to spread the message of water conservation.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I feel like you can see me speaking, but I urge you to dedicate your thoughts and expressions in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that last time I had spoken about a book containing the stories of Bremchand Ji and whoever has to read it, share your thoughts through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have presented their views on the books written on various sectors such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some others are asking me to talk about many other books.
Of course I will talk about some other books.
But now I have to acknowledge that I do not get enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we have to move ahead with the experience that has been experienced in the last one month.
Friends, I have touched the voice of Mann Ki Baat about water conservation. But before this, I feel that water conservation is a matter of touching your hearts, it is a matter of great interest for the common man.
It is a matter that has been driven the entire country for a few days, it is water.
Several serious efforts are being made to impact water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
Media has also taken up several innovative movements related to water conservation.
I am happy to know that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the North East, has created a water policy for itself.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
Agricultural cultivation of low water consumption in Haryana is being encouraged by the farmers.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
This, especially the achievements of children and their success, gives us enthusiasm and new energy.
The things that I have said now can unite you with pride and zeal.
We are very well aware of how much cancer can be produced in the world.
While waiting at the doors of death, these ten children have not only run away from cancer in their struggle for life-survival but also fame the name of the country due to their wonderful actions.
This month in Moscow - World Children's Winners Games World Children's Competition.
The event was organised for shooting, square, swimming, swimming, football, table tennis.
These ten winners of our country have won medals in this medal and some of them have won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that the success of Chandrayaan 2 across the sky and the success of India in space will give you joy and pride.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Many people like Arvind Rao, from different parts of the country, NarendraModi App and MyGov have been asking to talk about this Chandrayaan 2 in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The year 2019 has to be said to be India's most privileged year in terms of space.
Our scientists launched A-SAT in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
We were unable to speak much about the very important issue of A-SAT in the electoral process.
But the A-SAT missile is 300 km above the ground in just 3 minutes.
On 22nd July, Ponga Chandrayaan was proud of the country.
Chandrayaan 2: This goal is important in various angles.
Chandrayaan 2 will help in furthering our understanding of the moon.
Even in our lives, we have to face temporary recessions
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I invite our youngsters to participate in this uestion Post.
Knowledge of space, Indias space programme and scientific technology will be the theme of this question competition.
For instance, what is to be done in the launch of the rocket, how the satellites are set on the rotation path, what are the information we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT
On the MyGov website, the competition will be reported on 1st August.
I invite my young friends and students.
I urge all the schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to win your school.
I inspire all the students to join them.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in every state to Sriharikota at its own cost
They will also get the opportunity to see the Chandrayaan landscape on the surface of the moon in September.
Our Mann Ki Baat has accelerated the Swachhta movement in many times
Similarly, the efforts being made for cleanliness have also inspired the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has established new standards of cleanliness with the help of everyone's contribution.
I have not said that we have achieved the ideals of cleanliness but the success of the cleanliness mission from the habit of open defecation to public places, the strength of the determination of 130 crore people
But we won't stop with it.
This movement is now moving from waste to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I got to know about Yogesh Saini ji and his team through the media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and has returned to the country to serve Mother India by breaking the work he has seen in America.
Just a while ago, he challenged Delhi not only to be clean but also to beauty-rich.
He started his work with his team from the dustbins in Lodhi Garden.
You must have remembered how the streets of Prayag Raj have shine in paintings on the Kumbh.
I am aware that Yogesh Saini ji and his team had shown their handlooms there.
We also feel this experienced in the beauty of the Swachhta Mission.
It is important that the principle of waste to wealth should be strengthened in our society, it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had read an interesting view in MyGov.
Mohammad Aslam, who lives in Shobian area of Jammu and Kashmir, has registered this.
I like Mann Ki Baat.
I am happy to note that in my state of Jammu and Kashmir, I have contributed positively to the Revival of Village to unite society.
The programme was organised in June.
I think this will be the first action plan to direct the people to the government.
Several other things have been linked to make this project more interesting.
Under the Khelo India programme, sports competitions have been organized for children.
They were awarded sports equipment, workshops for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment, Scheduled Tribes Certificates.
In a way, this event is a festival of development, a festival of public participation and a celebration of public awareness.
A large number of people participated in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it is a matter of joy that the events for this programme of Return to Village have been done in the rural areas, government officials have climbed the hard mountainous roads to reach such far-flung villages and walked a two-day walk.
The officers also visited the border villages of Sadasarvaka and beyond the border and travelled without any fear of the worst parts of Shobian, Pulwama, Gulgaon and Anantnag districts.
If the reception given to them has affected many officers, they have spent more than two days in these villages.
All these things are comfortable for organizing Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, ensuring large numbers of peoples participation and making their own plans.
New determination, new zeal and wonderful results.
It also makes it clear that those who seek to sow obstacles and humility in the development journey will never succeed.
My heartfelt countrymen, how do you know that Dattatreya Ramchandra Pentre, who has won the Gyanpeeth award, has written in one of his poems about Marikal
People from different cultures and languages across the country have been happy to celebrate the Maritime in their own way.
If we look around us in this season, the earth will be seen as if we have fought some cow war on him.
There is a new energy influencing on the four sides.
In this holy month many devotees take a vow, take a pilgrimage to Amarnath, and many have a dinner, with great enthusiasm waiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
This is the time when the festival of Raksha Bandhan comes out of the love of brothers and sisters.
When we talk about Marikal, you will be happy to know that this time more than four years of devotees have participated in Amarnath Yatra.
More than 3 lakh devotees have darshaned in the sacred Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the number of people who participated in this 60-day pilgrimage in 2015, the number has been crossed in just 28 days.
I would like to extend my special greetings to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality behind the success of the Amarnath pilgrimage.
All those who have returned after the journey are attracted by the hospitality and comfort of the people of the state.
All this will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
It is said that even in Uttarakhand this year Sardham pilgrimage has started and more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple in just one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity that took place in 2013, people have taken a pilgrimage in such a number of achievements.
I urge you to visit some places of beauty in the season of monsoon and play somewhere in the country.
To see such beauty places of our country, nobody else can feel the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage.
May this beautiful and lifelong month of Marikal give you new energy, new hopes and new aspirations.
Similarly, in August, the memories of the uit India Movement are reflected.
On the other hand, there is a heaviness in different parts of the country and in many areas the people of the country are flooded.
When we see the rain on television, we see only one point of view - wherever we see floods, water and transport stagnation.
I will come again after a month's wait.
Today people from Christian community all over the world will be celebrating Easter Time.
Today, when India is playing with Australia, I convey my best wishes to both the teammen.
24 teams in the world are playing in India, India won the Gold in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India won the fourth position in the 1956 Olympics.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been very low in rankings.
Today, it is difficult to leave our position to the extent that our position has fallen in the FIFA rankings.
Be it EPL or Spanish League or Indian Super League, today I have seen that the interest of Indian youth is increasing in footwear.
Young people of India are watching televisions to know more about footwear.
At the same time, we can use this opportunity and try to take the football to every village and every street.
2017 FIFA Under-17 World Cup is such an opportunity, in this year, we should try to foster a new zeal and innovation among the youth in four parts of the country.
I believe this is an opportunity to brand India globally.
You must have planned that my beloved students can travel on holidays.
Very few people go abroad, most of them go to tourism for 5 days and 7 days in each state.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
Does there be a district that I have not gone to India
Tourism has the greatest strength in creating our lives. Now the youth of India are showing great interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel on the path that everybody has gone or built, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I consider it a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if the coal makes the hands black, the others will run away on their own.
But it is a pleasure to set up a tourism circuit with the same coal.
This is just a beginning, so far more than 10,000 people have enjoyed musical coal mining tourism in the Sawaner village near Nagpur.
It provides an opportunity to see an innovation.
Can you contribute to cleanliness when you go to other places during this holiday
This may not be done very scientificly, but it is true to happen.
Can you also work as a tourist in a strong collaboration with the idea of Swachhta at the tourist centre
India's tourism is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with one mind then we can attract the world.
Let us move in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like that some holidays have come and gone.
You also think in this perspective.
Would you like to waste your vacations, the important years of life, the moments of their importance
I'm offering you an idea to your child.
Can you develop a capabilities during your vacation, can you add a new thing to the pride of your governance
If you don't know swimming, I will learn swimming during the holiday or if you don't know the cycling, you can decide that I will learn a cycling.
Even today, if I'm typing on the computer with two fingers, can I do the journal text
How many capabilities are there to develop our governance
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our shortcomings
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Think now, there is no need for big teeth for this, no trainee is required, no higher fee is required, no big cost is required.
Similarly, there will be discussions with other friends.
I believe that you will definitely do this and tell me what you have learnt new things.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
The Prime Minister, you have said that during the last summer holidays, the birds will have the heat of summer, so we should put water in a vessel in the balcony or on the floor of the house, so that they can get water.
I was very happy when I did this work, through which my friendship with many birds blossomed.
This time again I would like to urge you to express it in the voice of your mind.
He's reminded me of a good activity by contacting the phone.
I was asking you to fill water in soil utensils outside your house in summer season.
Abi has told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds have become his lover.
Mahadevi Varma ji, one of the great poets in the world of Hindi literature, had a great fascination on birds.
In his poems, I will not let you go away, I will fill the court with grains, I will fill the cold tears everywhere.
Cooke from Mysore has put forward a very fine idea.
Have we ever given them drink water
My heartfelt thanks to you, Shilpa, you have put forward the spiritual idea in a very natural way.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard more about Digital India.
For some people, this digital India is a matter of youth in some city.
If you make the App for the facility of these farmers on your mobile phones, you will get all the information related to agriculture and climate in your handloom.
What is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets, what is the trend of good harvest and what kind of pesticides will be suitable from it.
If you ask any questions to them, you answer it or you understand it.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to give this app to the farmers on their mobile phones.
We have tried to create wealth for water conservation through Manrega.
There may be a lot of villages that have created such awareness in the country, some of the leading farmers may have a lot of aware citizens.
I welcome it.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes will be of two types, one Type 1 and other type 2.
Type 1 is a hereditary, heritary and mother-father.
Type 2, due to habits, due to age, due to obesity.
It has been established as the centre of World Health Day on 7th, as the world has created a diabetes concern.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical labor is decreasing.
Can we get conception on 7th April and get into action in our lives to defeat diabetes
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get medical checkups done with difficulty.
Well, only after the situation has worsened, it has been known that diabetes has been there for a long time.
There is a reduction in the country in comparison to the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
With the right treatment, this disease can be resolved.
India should be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, it cannot be eliminated only by governments, doctors and medicines.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to eliminate diabetes and eliminate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events are being organized in April, especially on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Baba Saheb Ambedkar Ji.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country.
I have got the privilege to visit Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji's birthplace on 14th April this year.
Baba Saheb has given us all that he needs to be a good citizen.
We can pay homage to him by walking on his path and living as a good citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Year will start.
New Year is celebrated in different forms in different states.
My New Year greetings to all.
You know that whenever you want to hear the voice of my mind, I have said this last time that you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask it at a pleasant time.
You can hear it on your mobile phone.
I am happy to be with you.
My dear countrymen, my warm greetings to you all.
I extend my best wishes to all of you on the eastern festival.
My young friends, you all will be on one side of the election.
There's a glorious inspiration.
You may have known that in the next year 2017, India will host FIFA Under-17 World Cup competition in our country.
I would like to insist that the interest in the footsteps is increasing, but if such a big opportunity is to stop the doors of India, will we only be compelling and fulfill our duties
Last time also I had a request to you to welcome the picture of the place where you are going.
The work that the tourism sector cannot be done by our cultural sector, the work that the state governments and the Indian governments cannot be done by it, the work that crores of foreign people of the country have done.
When they see all the pictures they have done, it really enjoys.
We have to take this task forward, do this thing as well, but do this thing inclusively.
Not just sending a picture, but also show your creativity, whenever you go to new places, you can know a lot of things.
India is a diverse country.
If you start traveling once, you will be traveling throughout your life and you will be enjoying watching.
We usually want to stay away from coal mines.
When we look at the films of the people, we can imagine what happens to be there.
I am confident that my young friends will definitely be helpful in this work.
Whether it is a government or an organisation or a society or a citizen or a citizen, we all work together.
Your governance will be identified by it and your self-confidence will increase significantly.
They come to sell milk near our houses, news paper sellers come, postalists come, sometimes utensils and garment sellers go through.
Have we ever heard if you want to thirst when the heat of the summer remains
Only then can one drop of rain water be used without waste.
The beginning of farming for the farmers is very important.
But we should also think of what is happening if there is no water.
You must have noticed that this time you are trying to build 5 lakh lakes and irrigation ponds.
I remember that people are still scared as soon as I heard the name of DP at my young age.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis, proper treatment is essential, complete treatment is important.
If half the treatment is left in the middle then the disease will come again.
You give Missed foot, whenever you get time, you can ask the voices of the old Mann Ki Baat in your language.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you.
In a way, this is my endeavour of Mann Ki Baat in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat event will be held in 2016.
In a way, every festival leaves the hope of coming to the next festival.
At some points, India can also say that the economies that are drowned by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the lower sections of the society.
On this occasion, I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas festival and extend my best wishes for the coming 2016.
May you bring a lot of joy and joy to all of you in 2016, bring new enthusiasm, new spirit and new determination to new heights.
Whether it is extremism or the world becomes warm, it is natural calamities and the complication created by humanity.
The human society should live a peaceful well-being by getting rid of all these things - what else can be a greater joy
Chawle Sawarkar ji is a season of tourism, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists come and people go to many places for Christmas festivals
I welcome Ganesh ji's ideas, the ideas and images of India, the more clean our tourist destinations.
I take Ganesh ji's ideas among the people.
When we have come to our households, when we have come to the tradition that we have to see the guests as God, then we are busy cleaning and cleaning the house immediately, don't we
Similarly, we must keep the tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean in our country, so that we need to strengthen it.
I am glad that there are colors of news from all over the country about cleanliness.
I have been complimented with the media friends for this matter from the beginning day.
Because they are digging small and good things and bringing people to the sight.
I would like to share with you that I have just read the message that this work is a sacred thing that he has constructed only 100 toilets by his hard work in Bhojpura village.
The country is progressing at a rapid pace due to the untiring efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are walking on the path of progress with shoulders and the country is also progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills, increasing employment opportunities
Livelihood insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, global trade without space and setting up of necessary institutions for start-up of new enterprises are taking place on one side.
All the simple family members who cannot go to banks are now able to get easy loans through Mudra Yojana.
Today, Indians have started to understand that the milk of yoga art is being started all over the world.
When the whole world celebrates International Day of Yoga, how much a country is proud of us, was it not
This feeling will happen to us only when our thoughts and thoughts are in large quantity.
And when he opens the mouth of his mother Jashoth, the eye of the butter, then who can forget that she saw her eggs there
Similarly, Yoga Day has made us feel the importance of India as Indians.
Nowadays the talk of cleanliness is reflected in every household.
It is also a very comfortable thing for the government officials who have been working to bring electricity to those villages, whether it is a farmer or a poor, a young man or a mother or they have a sense of innovation in their lives.
Can't I do everything alone
But when I talk about this, should I also not give my contribution
An ordinary citizen can also join me with an app called Narendra Modi on his mobile phone.
I am sharing simple things in this.
I am happy that people also share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us work together with us on the interests of the common man and bring the common man to understand, let us convince them to get their liable things.
My young friends, on 15th August, I presented a basic idea of Start-up India, Stand-up India from the Red Fort.
After that, in all the sectors of the government, this was taken up.
Can India become a start-up capital
Start-up iaia, Stand-up iaia has brought a great opportunity to the younger society.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will start the start-up iaia and stand-up iadia operations in full swing.
We have a stable idea of start-ups that start-ups are the only people in the digital world and information technology sector.
Keeping in mind the requirements of India, we must make changes in it.
The intellectual capabilities of our younger generation are spread across the country.
This start-up iaia, Stand-up iaia should not be left in some cities, it should not be spread everywhere in the corner of India.
Therefore, I urge all the state governments to take this scheme forward.
On January 16, I will definitely share with you in detail in this regard.
I look forward to your high ideas.
My young friends, the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on January 12.
Like me, there are crores of people in this country.
From 1995 to 12 January, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti as the National Youth Day.
The festivals will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12 January to 16 January this year.
I especially urge my young friends to send your messages directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to understand and know what is in your mind.
Dilip Chauhan, a resident of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a disabled person who has no vision and has observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Dilip ji, thank you very much.
Sometimes when we meet people like him in our lives, the concentrated thoughts will run in our minds.
The idea of human beings like him will emerge on our thoughts.
There is no doubt that words have a significance.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Saukhya Bharat Yojana, I had arranged to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I could not participate in this event because I had to go there due to severe floods.
Though I couldn't participate in this event, I had thoughts about it in my mind.
To simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible vehicle stations, lifts and braille language languages in all ways, there is a need for innovations, technology requirements, systems need and understanding.
They should not die in cups.
Did not the schemes have been created for the common man and the poor
Efforts have been made a few days ago about how the beneficiaries are taking the benefits of the scheme in a simple manner.
In our country, subsidy for gas cylinders is being provided.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no account has been filed for this.
Whether the subsidy reaches the real beneficiaries or not at the right time, the government has made a small change in subsidy delivery.
By the end of November, about 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Bhahal Gas scheme.
15 crore beneficiaries have been directly credited to the bank accounts.
This happens without intermediaries, Sipariso and any possibility of corruption.
On one hand, the campaign for Aadhar ID card, on the other hand, Jan Dhan Bank Account, on the other hand, the Central Governments are preparing the list of beneficiaries and connecting it with Aadhar ID card and bank account.
There were colours of unanimous allegations regarding the project.
At many places the bank accounts of the workers who worked for money are being put directly.
So far, about Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries for about 35 and 40 schemes.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment for the Republic of India on January 26.
This day is a very important link to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary.
We have to take this forward.
Only during the elections, more publicity is that it is a sacred duties and layers will be written on the walls.
We will talk more about all the duties in the election season but why should not we talk about the same duties in daily life
This year, when we celebrate Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary, can't we organise a column, poetry competition and negotiating competition in schools, colleges, our villages and cities, in different societies and associations
When 125 crore people of the country take part in their duties and take it as one after another, look at how big a history will be created.
On 26th January, when we commemorate the President's Day, can we decorate and decorate the idols and surrounding places of the country by the students of school and colleges very well by citizens
I put forward the idea that it cannot be done as a citizen.
Afterwards we reflect sadness in maintaining the statues of those leaders whom we are very emotionally engaged in keeping the idols of the Chaura statues.
Can we not continue to clean up as a society and as a country
We will join us in this effort on 26th January.
My dear countrymen, once again greetings for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival is being started.
There is a different place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also beneficial for hurting and sometimes they give new impetus.
But sometimes when there are difficulties in the festival days, they are extremely sad.
From every corner of the world, information about natural calamities continues to come in color.
Unquestionably, there are reports of disaster events.
We are now experiencing how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and disaster relief operations.
The central government has always worked shoulder to shoulder.
I am confident that even after all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will again be able to progress at a rapid pace and will contribute to the progress of the country.
But there is a feeling that we have to make a change when we face such a difficult environment in four parts.
Until about 15 years ago, natural calamity had been associated with the agriculture sector because whenever natural calamity was only with dry and famine.
Governments, people, citizens and small and big institutions have to work in the field of skill development scientifically.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had a conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawas Sharif ji.
I suggested that in collaboration with all South Asian countries, we should undertake a joint operation to meet disasters.
I am glad that a seminar on the best ways to deal with disasters has also been held in New Delhi.
This is a good beginning.
I am speaking to Lakwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
We are engaged in the agriculture of natural resources and are also guiding many others in agriculture.
One of the reasons for this is that you are making natural farming
It is also a matter of great happiness that you have not only done this but you have also understood the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified, but it does not happen only in Punjab and Haryana states
This is our routine throughout India and traditionally we are burning the agricultural waste after cultivation.
We were unaware of the evil that was caused by this kind of burning beforehand, everybody was doing it, so I was doing it.
This has led to a steady increase and it has been associated with climate change today.
After the impact of this difficulty began to reach the cities, the voices of opposition to the people started to shout.
That's the real concern you have expressed.
In the first phase, our farmer friends should be trained and explained to them the truth.
After this, the burning of agricultural waste can save time, reduce the difficulty, the land will be ready for the next time.
But this is not the right principle.
Agricultural wastes are also very precious after harvest.
They are natural fertilizers.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them pieces of small pieces, they might be for cattle.
Secondly, if we burn them, the layer on the ground will fall.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Just think about a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidneys works properly, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body is burnt then can we live
Just as the skin of our body is burnt, we can't live, as we burn the skin of our body, the skin of the mother of the earth burns, the layer of our land burns.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers engaged in banana cultivation.
They shared their wonderful experiences to me.
They had to spend 5000, 10,000 and 15000 rupees per hectare to remove their lives after harvesting their lives.
No work was going on till the tractors had to carry them away.
Last time in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I talked about organ donation.
In this regard, I mentioned about NOTO Free Phone number.
Film actress Ravina Tandon and many others have added to it.
Body organ donation can save many lives.
What can be more bigger than this
The National Level Registration Centre for Organ Transformation (NLCT) was launched on 27th November, which includes details of patients waiting for organs and body donors.
I am confident that awareness will also spread in this sector, and I believe that the needy will definitely get help from time to time.
Because, as long as one doesn't have to donate, this help will not be available in any way.
I had said before that we will be following the Disabled Day on December 3.
Physically, physically, the disabled are unprecedented and unprecedented.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as caliphs, they feel sorry.
At some points, compassion and compassion are shown on them.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct the vision of seeing them, they will also become a concept for us, they will become a motivation for us to understand the achievements.
Their psychological determination, the ability to transform their lives into favours and difficulties that they face.
Today, I would like to talk about the 40-42-year-old Javed Ahmad Ji.
In 1996, the extremists fired at Jawad Ahmad in Kachmeer.
But Javed Ahmad did not accept the defeat.
The wounds of extremism did not make him crazy.
There was no part of his motivation: a person who did not commit any crime had been punished, his young man was wasted, but there was no anger or anger in his mind.
Despite lack of physical cooperation, he has dedicated himself to education for the last 20 years.
As a social worker, as a aware citizen, he is doing a peace revolution today as a messenger of disabled persons.
Is not Javed's life enough for all Indians to be conscious
I would like to remember Javed ji's life, his dedication and his dedication on 3rd December.
Even though I have been able to talk about them today due to the lack of time, the lamps that are illuminating and encouraging the lives of India are swinging around the corner of the country.
In this context, on December 3, we have to get inspiration from them.
In many cases, we are compulsory to work on governments.
The middle class, the middle class, the lower class, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the victims, the destitute, the oppressed, all are constantly associated with government and governmental organisations.
As an ordinary citizen, they are likely to have a bad experience with government employees in some way.
These couples are spending their wealth in their retirement life for the development of the poor.
The entire population of Tenthaka, the smallest village in Balasore district of Odisha, belongs to the tribal community.
The poorest village is a situation inflicted with malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an Asha servant from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this Denthaka will die due to malaria.
He pushed the struggle against malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
All such bells will be in the country.
You should not only read but also recommend others.
The creative power is the biggest energy.
You also share good events related to this, share these e-books and discuss this.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply worried about climate change.
National Energy Storage Day on December 14, 2018.
Several schemes are being implemented on the government side.
The LED bulb mission is progressing as a pioneer.
On the full moon day, I had once said that the street lights should be shut down at night and wet for an hour in the whole moonlight.
A friend had sent a link to my vision, I had the opportunity to see it.
I felt that I should share this with you.
He is trying to give light to the poor by using solar power, fighting with darkness and working in his name, he has formed a group of women.
He has launched a solar powered lander lighting journal.
He is offering these lander lamps at a cost of Rs 100 per month.
People buy these lights in the evening and give lighting to them in the morning.
I know that till I heard, about 500 households are giving this kind of electric londers.
Nurjahan is working in the work of giving light to these landers throughout the day.
But a good start has taken place.
In a very short span of time, 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh are women.
I have already said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
They have enjoyed this by Salesh Bonsley.
I know that he is buying a tanker and he has repayed a loan of Rs 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our objective of Mudra Yojana.
The same thing happened in the matter of Mamta Sharma ji from Bhopal.
He also got Rs 40,000 from the bank under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is engaged in manufacturing handicrafts.
Because there is no need to pay more interest, there is a saving of about 1000 rupees per month.
His family also had a good business.
But I want this scheme to be more popular and expanded.
All our banks should reach this with greater understanding and come forward to help small traders in large numbers.
In fact, they are the economic drives of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to inspire them.
Good work has been done, but it has to be done more and more well.
It means that Rashtrayam Jagrayam Vyas, Eternal Vigilance is the prize of freedom, that is, being awakened permanently, the price we give for freedom.
The word of unity of the country must continue to shine.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I am confident that your suggestions will certainly be beneficial.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter starts.
Once again my best wishes to the people of my country, Jai Hind
I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the 5th day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
Gandhi Mandela has been described as a series of 5 day cricket competitions.
Therefore, the interest in the final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the friends of All India Radio at Kannur Station.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all the friends of Kannur Radio Station.
I once again want to mention about Kerala today.
A letter has been sent to me by the students of Dudh Mary Upper Primary School from the Citrus area of Kerala.
This letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls had registered their thumb maps and put the cloth of Bharat Mata in a big cloth.
The picture of Mother India has been sent to me on the Indian map.
I first wondered why they have put this film on their thumb mipe records.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I did it to me that they sent me a big index message.
They are engaged in the awareness campaign on organ donation.
About 80-year-old Vasantrao Suduke Guruji of Maharashtra has been running a movement for a long time.
He wants to celebrate organ donation as a festival.
Nowadays, I have been telephone and many news and information.
Devesh ji from Delhi has also sent me a message like this.
I am talking to Devesh from Delhi - I am very happy to note that the government's efforts to donate organs and policy programmes related to it.
I know that countries such as China are at a very advanced position in the matter of organ donation, and it is very important to appreciate the goal of donating one million organs to the government.
More than 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
But in a country with 125 crore people, we can only implement only 5,000 organ changes.
Every year there is a need to give light to one lakh eyes.
But we can only give light to 25,000 people.
If 4 people need eyes, we can only give it to one person.
Efforts have been made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in the efforts to simplify the administrative processes related to it.
I am told that Tamil Nadu is the first to donate organs.
A 24-hour Helpline is being served through 1800 11 4770.
Our ancestors are also supposed to be honey diagnosed Bunjeetha or not
That is, they have said the joy of making sacrifices through the words of Honey Tyakdena Bunjeetha.
In the last days, the GST in Delhi has been reduced to Rs.
This surgery was successful and a life was saved.
A few days later we are also celebrating Deepawali.
We also celebrated the festivals of Eit and Ganesh Chaturthi.
The Indian African Conclave is scheduled to be held in the capital of India from 26th to 29th October, 2018.
This is the first time that such a large summit will be held in the Indian soil.
Heads of 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of our two countries is one third of the world.
It is said that India and Africa have been the only geography several thousand years ago and then two parts of the Indian Ocean.
We have a lot of unity.
Indias wildlife and Africa's wildlife can see many similarities.
Natural resources also have a lot of similarity.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in African countries for years.
There are links between India and African countries in economic, cultural and political fields.
But above all, India is playing a big role in training younger generations of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in India in human resource development and capacity building.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is organising a very important event.
Competitions have been organised for poetry writing and enhancing their contribution amongst all the students of schools connected with CBSEs.
Thousands of schoolchildren have written about the information about Indian African relations.
Millions of school students have seen this exhibition, the villagers have seen this exhibition, what was the contribution of Annal Gandhians in the relationship between Africa and India and the people knew how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two regions.
There were many important contributions in the competition.
I like a poem that has taken my heart, so I want to teach it to you.
I congratulate all the students, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development, who have participated in this event.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansat Adarsh Gram Yojana, the MP Model Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, many member friends have completed this work.
They are fully involved in this.
Last month, a polling booth was organized in Bhopal.
Heads of the villages, district rulers, some parliamentarians and officials from the Central State Governments were also present in a detailed discussion on the Model Gram Yojana.
Through this, a variety of new ideas have emerged as a motivation.
I would certainly like to bring some things to your attention.
Jharkhand is one way more tribal residential area.
Unfortunately, it is a memorable remembrance when we talk about Jharkhand that is Mao extremists, bomb culture and murder.
Many areas have been destroyed by the impact of these left-wing extremists.
But our senior parliamentarian, Kariya Munda, who has worked as the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of that region, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started going there, enhanced confidence in the minds of the people, made efforts to give life to the government institutions, inspired the officers to come and work there.
He established a nation to involve development in that area which has long been neglected.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Gram Yojana, a successful effort to create awareness among the people has been made in this Bursi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the respected Parliamentarian Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are being made and he has created a great innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to the students studying in the schools there.
He urged the upper class students to study their parents in this class.
The school was likely to provide education to students in the morning and their parents in the evening.
Around 550 uneducated senior citizens were taught the same children.
Behold, without any budget in society, without any rotation, without any other special facilities, only through psychological determination, how many big changes have been made
This is the lesson given to us by Dwarapuri Gram Panchayat.
This village is known for sugarcane production and sugarcane festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the sugarcane festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right thing.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of one thing that after the festival of Deepawali last year, in our country, especially the media launched a movement.
Your idea is true that even after the festivals we are making efforts towards cleanliness.
Our work should be done during every public event.
I congratulate all the media of India today.
On 2nd October last year, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Gandhijis and the completion of one year of Swachh Bharat Mission, the India Today Group had the opportunity to participate in the Swachhtagiri programme organized by the Swachh Bharat Mission.
For the last one year, he has been encouraging cleanliness related works through ETV, and his newspapers have the colour of news about it, and he focuses only on creative work.
He has connected 51 lakh children from about 55 to 56,000 schools from Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Whether it is public places, railway stations, pilgrimages, hospitals or parks, he has been campaigning for cleanliness at many places.
These messages also strengthen the creation of a Swachh Bharat.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme titled India My Country.
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in their minds to reflect the awareness about cleanliness among the people.
NDTV has organised a campaign to create a Swachh Bharat.
There are many channels and newspapers in our country and I cannot tell the names of all due to lack of time but everybody has taken this movement.
Over the past several years, this village has been working as a pillar of cleanliness and every generation has been working intensively towards cleanliness.
A few years ago, the government has written in that letter that this village has been awarded the most clean village of Asia.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya in the remote north-eastern region of our country has been engaged in cleanliness for years.
This has become a culture of the village.
Such events that our country is surely clean, give us confidence in itself.
My dear countrymen, when I was speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I said that corruption has become affordable in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
We have made an important announcement in the last budget.
Accordingly, you will be able to get the interest of the gold stored in the bank by paying your gold to the bank, as you get interest for your investment amount.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be paid to you by the bank interest.
Now tell me, people of the country, don't you pay gold
Doesn't the gold glassed in unnecessarily turn into a whole life force
Do not keep gold in the house waste.
Do not miss the benefits of its safety and circle.
So we don't have to buy gold, we don't have to protect gold, no one can make papers.
I will definitely dedicate this project that will provide security in the next week.
However, we have so far utilised foreign gold currency or we have used foreign gold bundles.
Why shouldn't there be a domestic index for our country
Therefore, in the coming week, 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra will be released before the Tanderas pilgrimage.
Besides, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new project will make a new change in the path of economic growth and I am confident that your full cooperation will be there in it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji's birth anniversary.
When Patel was the theme of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, he thought about them, the entire India would be in mind.
This great man has contributed to Indias integration.
Not only these diversities, the beauty that has given us pride, it will not go to us.
Therefore, only diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the past several years, on 31st October, there has been a movement of unity.
I have got the opportunity to participate in it before.
I am told that this time, arrangements are being made in different parts and people are engaged in the preparation of unity drive with enthusiasm.
The movement of unity is actually the drive towards development.
In other words, the guarantee for development is the movement of unity.
Come, let us pay tributes to Sardar.
We will take the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are preparing for the festival of Deepawali.
I especially urge the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but to ensure that our children do not have any harm, and we must have done cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, the next day I will be visiting the UK to Deepawali.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am confident that when our children are going to study in Britain, this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a tourist destination for them and is a center of conception.
This is the message of Baba Saheb Ambedkar that he had not lived in his life as much as possible and his lives for the country.
It is a matter of understanding that the work of Lord Basaveshwar has been done for democracy and women empowerment several years ago.
The dedication of Lord Basavaswara's idol to the people of the world in London is an excellent example of how the idea of the great people of India had been and how far the vision of India had been.
When such an event is joined, the hearts of the people of the country are filled with humility.
Your suggestions are colored to me through in.
Afterwards, programmes are being prepared in All India Radio with your letters, government officials are being invited and discussed, some people are trying to solve their problems when they write about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
Though I have some languages, it is true that I cannot learn all these languages.
I will definitely try at 8 pm to enter your minds in your language.
See how close our relations have grown.
The last one year was over
Today we have stepped up in the new year.
Once again my best wishes to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you, this is the 12th edition of Mann Ki Baat.
Peoples power has great importance in democracy.
I believe in this people's power because of this idea that is based on my life.
But the voice of Mann Ki Baat has taught several things, they have shared experiences, all these things have been understood by all of us how important the peoples power is.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti Mahesan Shakti.
I can tell you that with the experience I have received in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there is a great strength in the minds of our ancestors, there is a great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio and they have not seen these suggestions as papers, they have seen them as aspirations of the people.
In terms of administration, information must be from the bottom to the bottom and guidance must be from top to bottom.
Who would have thought that Mann Ki Baat will become a synonym of information
But this has become the same.
I had said that on October 2, we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
There was a time when there was a buzz for the country, but shouldn't it be a buzz for speech today
Not much, I'm gonna buy something.
I am happy to note that the sale of millets in the last one year is almost two.
Even the common man of the society, the middle elite and the middle elite have to bear subsidy is difficult.
Nevertheless, they're ruined.
Isn't this a peace revolution
Is this not the expression of people's power
Governments should also learn the lessons that there is a great manpower beyond the bureaucracy of government sectors, which is powerful, capable and determined.
After the Mann Ki Baat programme, all of them have become determined to me.
Therefore, today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, once again I would like to express my heartfelt greetings to the people's power.
People have also considered the small things I have spoken as one thing, they have made themselves for the welfare of the country, they have added themselves to it.
What else can be enjoyable than this
This time, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of adopting a new approach.
I urge the people of the country to contact you through phone and register your questions and your suggestions.
Consultations from all parts of India have been concentrated so much that there is nothing to be an invitee part.
This is a pleasant experience.
All ages have given suggestions.
It was also comfortable to ask some suggestions and my team is focusing on others.
You may have spoken for a minute, but your suggestions and messages are very important for me.
The government will definitely pay its full attention to your suggestions.
It is generally seen that negativeness is full of negative ideas on four sides
But my experience is different.
Moreover, in particular, the calls from the disabled have been received from the visually impaired.
They can't see televisions, they're asking for radio.
Pawan Acharya ji from Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a message with me.
I want all the people of the country to listen to the advice of Bhavan Acharya ji and follow it.
My name is Pawan Acharya, I belong to the Alwar region of Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Deepawali, I urge the people of the country to urge the people of the country to use plenty of soil lamps.
He also called upon the poor who don't have any environmental pollution by using soil cells, while providing employment to thousands of soil planters.
I appeal to the people of the country that if we listen to the suggestions of Bhawan Acharya, the lights of the soil will be delivered to our households, but the light will fall in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, during the time of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the army.
After the completion of 50 years of the war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition has been organised near India Gate to mark the valour of valour.
We have heard of the glorious moments of war, the unmatched courage and sacrifice of our soldiers, the photographs of that period or the films of that period.
If you want to create history, you must understand the signs of history well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our natural and we should also make the means of it.
I didn't misunderstand this.
I am very well aware that the Parliament of the country is also engaged in discussions on cleanliness.
On the other hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
The movement of ideas is going on, an atmosphere is being created against pollution and it is creating awareness about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhians said
Once I want to choose one among them, freedom and cleanliness, I would first like cleanliness and then I would like the freedom of the country.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhians.
Kulshan Arora from Delhi has registered a report on the MyGov portal.
Deendayal Udayaya wanted to know about their centenary.
Even last year, I had said that many types of fashion clothes might have been dressed, but I had to say that they should have a lot of fashion.
I want you to get some place for it.
Last time you have almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work that the government could not spend several crores of rupees with a small help.
This is the people's power itself, so I once again appeal to you in this regard.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also delighted for another thing.
I want to share this with you.
In May, I went to Kolkata and the family members of Subhash Bose had come to meet me.
The meeting was organised by his brother, son Chandra Bose.
Chandra Bose and his family were engaged in this work and it was decided that last week more than 50 families of Subhash Bose ji are coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how much joy is this for me
Many of the family members of Subhash Babu live in other countries.
Do I know how much joy that everyone is coming for this
I look forward to welcome them.
We have to take this as a habit.
I would like the youngsters of the country to make efforts to add themselves to the electoral rolls and also to participate in the voting.
During the elections, I am just telling one thing, first voting, then everything else.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Among them, I met a young man studying in the seventh grade of Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying class 7 at Kendriya Vidyalaya, Banaras Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
This 9-year-old girl, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi, is the daughter of Sadavruj Patel.
She is a woman from the poorest family.
The whole singing of this girl is under the head, but the biggest thing is that when she heard of some sloka of the Gita, she handed it over and gave her English description and the Hindi language explaination.
When I asked her father about this, she told her that she was telling it from her 5th age.
It is also a wonder for all of us in his family.
This had a great impact on me in your own.
Some children have an interest in popularity, but there is no such interest in child Sonamuko.
I just felt that God gave her some special power.
I have met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, the voice of Mann Ki Baat should be made once a week, because it gives us more conception.
Sandeep ji, don't you know what you want to buy from me
Now it is fit for a month.
A year has been completed since Mann Ki Baat.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used the gold
He started the broadcast in Germany and spread his views through radio about the freedom fighter for the people living in India.
Azad Hind launched the radio through a weekly report.
He broadcast radio in many languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu and Pashtu.
Myself, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, my radio broadcasting has completed a year.
Your contribution is invaluable to me.
Once again my best wishes to all of you.
My dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you.
Once again I have got an opportunity to tell you the voice of my mind.
The people of the southern region of the country are celebrating the festival of Onam and the festival of Raksha Bandhan was celebrated throughout the country yesterday.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security, keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, all of them have joined these projects in a broader manner.
On the occasion of Raksha Bandhan tomorrow, we had made a small appeal to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I am told that in a short span of time, about 11 crore families are connecting themselves with this scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are in the form of mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good symptom.
I extend my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme that cannot be completed in 60 years can be implemented in such a short span of time.
However, it is a matter of joy that all the departments associated with the implementation of this scheme and all the branches of the banks have been engaged in it with full force and mind, and we have succeeded in this scheme, on the basis of the information provided to me so far, about 17.
Even when it was said that even the venerable accounts could be started, they have saved Rs. 22,000 crores.
The banking sector is also one of the key implications of the economy and has reached the houses of the poor.
Today, 1.
25 lakh bank companions are working on the field.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Now thousands of people are now empowered to take overdraft due to this Jan Dhan scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I would like to congratulate all those associated with this and request the poor to never break your relationship with the banks.
Banks are yours, you don't get away from it in any way.
We have brought the banks to the doors of your homes, do not leave it, hold it thick.
We all have to have bank accounts of money.
I don't believe that you will definitely do this.
A few days ago, the incidents of violence in Gujarat and the entire country have lost peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of demand has taken place in the land of Gandhi and Sardar, which is a matter of deep sorrow and pain for all the people of the country.
Peace, integrity and brotherhood - this path is right
On the path of progress, all of us should stand shoulder to shoulder to shoulder.
Progress can only solve all our problems.
The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud that Buddhist monks from all over the world participate in this event.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to share the voice of my mind with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers, I have come here in several ways.
My farmer brothers and sisters, do not let my dear farmers burst, do not be afraid.
I firmly assure you that if anyone trys to guide you in the wrong way to make you nervous, we will not take any action in order to make you nervous.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value but the ideas and voices of the farmers have a unique importance.
We brought an emergency law.
The Ordinance is scheduled to be expired by 31st August tomorrow.
This will ensure that the farmers do not get financially damaged.
I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not merely foolish words but this is a mantra for us.
The interests of the poor farmers living in the villages are in our minds.
Therefore, I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should not only be the agriculture sector but also work as the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
We are moving this resolution faster.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, after the completion of the war in 1965, 50 years were completed.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri about him.
Similarly, we will also remember the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan.
Our scientists are really making significant progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
This was a conception for me and academic.
Many young scientists shared with me very fast things and I have seen many dreams in their eyes.
Even in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I had said that we should guide our students to science.
I had also spoken during my Independence Day speech about what is the need for direct examination in the lower levels.
During the invitation for an indirect election, every poor family, widows and mothers have to get a recommended letter, asking for the help of someone to get a job.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption at the grassroots.
I had said that there should be no direct examination under a specific position.
I am glad that the government is progressing at a rapid pace in this direction, suggestions are being made, this resolution will almost be fulfilled and the direct examination of lower level posts will be tired.
Today, there are colors of international dignitaries for India.
A conference was organized in India by 24 countries in the world to implement Call to Action Plans to reduce the maternal mortality rate.
For the first time outside the US, this discussion was held in India.
Every year about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children in our country die after delivery.
As we got rid of polio, we have also been released from tetanus as a cause for maternal and child mortality.
The world has accepted this.
But even today we must save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, Today, dengue fever is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid it.
My appeal to Swachh Bharat is related to it.
Even if we see advertising on television, our attention does not go on them.
Even though advertisements are provided in the newspapers, our pictures are not paid in them.
Cleanliness and clean water conservation in small matters in the households are being made aware of the people
However, we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities in it, but sometimes we don't know about the accumulation of water around us.
I urge you not to spread the slaughter so easily for death.
Life is very valuable.
The lack of water consumption and hygiene neglect are the calls for death, it is not right.
Around 514 dengue fever identification centres have been set up across the country and free examinations have been conducted here.
Timely testing and getting treatment is the best to save lives.
Your greater cooperation in this regard is very important.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, festivals and festivals will be filled in the coming days of our country.
Why should we not connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will be habitual, right
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy information with you.
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
In the minds of Mahendra Mahajan, the interests of the tribal people of our country are enhanced.
Both of these brothers have made India proud.
This year, both of these brothers have succeeded in this bond and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But in all these endeavours, they are taking into consideration the interests of the team iaia, vision for Tribals and the tribes.
See how everyone is contributing to the progress of the country.
When asked about such events, the heart is glorious.
Sometimes due to our perspective, we have committed terrible injustice to our younger communities.
An idea of not knowing anything for the new generation is with the older generation and I believe that this trend has been for centuries.
But my experience is different from the younger generation.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can also learn many things.
I have met several youngsters who have decided to ride a bike on Sunday.
Some people are following it as a cycle day that I will travel on a bike one day a week.
They say that it gives me the benefit of my health and the benefit of the environment and the happiness of the youth.
Cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people incentivizing cycle travel.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievement of two youngsters of India has made the country proud, the vision of the youth of the country is worth mentioning.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial on the Hindu Mills land in Mumbai has been drawn from temptation for a long time.
The memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, which will be set up by the Government of Maharashtra, will give a vision when Indians visiting the world to London.
I convey my heartfelt wishes and congratulations to the state government of Maharashtra, who has been trying to make these two memorials for the pride of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes and thanks to you all.
There is a huge shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses and a bit of oil to include porridges.
I am glad that there is an increase of 50 percent in the present pulses and there is an increase of about 33 percent in oil crops.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers for this thing.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July has been described as a day of victory in the Kargil war in history of our country.
The Kargil war has not only taken place on the borders, but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it important for another matter.
After the formation of our government in 2014, in a few months, on July 26, we launched the MyGov website.
I am glad that about 2 crore people have gone to the MyGov website when the government has completed nearly one year and about 5.
More than 50,000 people have given their suggestions in the PMO application and have spent their golden time for this, and have given their philosophy in it, it is more pleasant that they consider it a matter of great importance.
They have given very precious suggestions.
However, the people of the government have not been able to pay any attention to this thing, but brothers and sisters, Allesh Vajpayee ji, have been consulted by the government and today we have been implementing it.
Today, any scheme of the government is being created a logo and tag line, projects are being implemented, policies are being formulated and many positive suggestions are being received on the MyGov website.
Now, on August 15, I have started consulting myself on the MyGov address.
Suchitra Vadavachari from Chennai has given me several suggestions.
Beti Bachao, Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Ganga and Swachh Bharat should be spoken.
This is an idea in my mind and this time, on 15th August, you can register your views on what I should talk about.
You can send MyGov to the address, write to the radio, send it to the Prime Minister's Office.
It is a great idea that I should get what place to get from the public in my speech on 15th August.
Of course, I believe that you will give me the best ideas.
Two days ago, my child went to an accident in Delhi, and after that accident, the life of the person who traveled in Scotter had stirred up for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
People have been asking me on several occasions that you should talk about road safety and create awareness.
All of you're worried right.
If we wash the statistics, the heart would stop.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
But I urge parents to create an environment in the family regarding adoption of all aspects of safety, whether it is a 2-wheeler vehicle or 4-wheeler vehicle.
The government has also taken several initiatives in this regard, whether it is aware of road safety, be it engineering related to road construction, be it law enforcement, be it emergency treatment for the injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Safety Bill to the injured.
In the coming days, we plan to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
We are focusing on cashless treatment on national highways like Gudgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi.
Accordingly, we are thinking about the most important life saving measures in the first 50 hours and how to get care and care.
In fact, every life is valued with the point of view of how accidents are not happening.
At some points, I have said that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
In the last few days, I share with you some events that touched my heart with this idea.
It is a good feeling to see how everybody can bring life to his own work.
Vijay Biswal ji has expressed how his country, his artisticity and his goodness can be linked to his work.
I believe that Vijay Biswal's picture can be a matter of speaking in the coming days.
I wish that a large group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has touched my heart.
Sometimes, some small things are also very pleasant and that is why I share them with you.
There is a village named Keshla in Rajnandka of Chhattisgarh state
Over the past few months, we have made a campaign to build toilets.
Now no one from that village needs to spend natural resources in the open space.
Whatever happens, when it was completed, like a big festival, the entire village celebrated it.
The best examples of how the values are changing in social life, how the attitude of the people is changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country on the path of progress.
Bhavesh Day from Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the Northeast.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry named DONER i. e.
Well, we cannot decide the interests of the Northeast states by sitting in Delhi or not
Therefore, a team of officials of the Government of India visited the North East region including Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim
This endeavour will have good results in the coming days.
This is a wonderful endeavour, an effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas and I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the success of the Satellite Travel Scheme.
A few days ago, India has launched 5 satellites in the United Kingdom through its PSLV C28.
Even though this news is not one of the most attractive points, it is a great achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the youngsters of the country, what you want after developing, I want only one hundred of them as a scientist.
It is a matter of concern that the country's lack of science is a matter of concern.
Under this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Movement.
I have been asking the officers of the Government of India to spend one and a half hours a week to encourage the students of school and colleges around you, share your experiences with them. This will definitely help them.
Our villages should get electricity for 24 hours or not
This work is hard, but it must be done only.
Today, even though we have to charge the mobile, we have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should also be extended to the villages and these facilities should be provided to the poor of the market.
That is why we have launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti scheme.
Our country is the largest country, where there are thousands of villages and to ensure electricity supply to remote areas.
Your ideas will help me.
Thank you very much
I didn't expect you to get such a large amount of answers when I said so.
Millions of people have sent photographs through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
I have also retweeted some of them attracting my views.
If some people have not registered pictures of the Bellam caves of Andhra Pradesh (B) then many of the people of the country have such caves.
This is the picture of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We always know Rajasthan as a state of water deficiency, but it is very surprising that one from there sends pictures of waterfalls on Manal.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure you that Yoga is not the sunset in the world.
On seeing how much the world is spreading the red color of yoga, which Indian has no pride and pride in his mind
And I also blossomed in a flood of joy: and the heart was overthrown.
While the Chinese River and Eiffel Tower are very proud of the people of France, they have also chosen these symbols to be the background of Yoga.
New York people have learnt the Times Square for Yoga.
While talking about Australia's Sydney, the scenes of Africa's house are illuminated immediately in mind.
Australian nationals have conducted yoga practices before the Afra House Mark.
Rajpath is Yoga.
A new evolution, a new spirit, a new zeal, a new zeal, a new zeal in all the crores of the world.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had tweeted a picture of Yoga, which was very fascinating and famous all over the world.
Women, men, elderly, children, villagers, urbanisations, developing countries and developing countries are part of Yoga.
Yoga is actually a factor in connecting the world.
I do not know how the world of intellectuals will wash and criticize this event.
But I feel a matter of pride for every Indian that the world is very interested in knowing about India.
An interest in India has increased and the world is keen to know about Indias values, traditions and culture.
But if we have the pride and pride of our heritage then we can make it better to the world.
Sometimes, we think of what is innovation in this, for example, our family values can be said, and we do not know that the family values of India are the biggest thing for the world.
I appeal to the youth of the country, especially the youth in the field of Information Technology - all of you, all of you, together, plan online Yoga.
Do you know that there is a sector called AYUSH in the government
Nobody's attention should be returned to it.
In five years, there will be news about it two or four times, and a small sector from one corner.
But it took the lead during Yoga Day.
The smallest sector has shown the largest work in the world.
This is an example of how many small organisations can be fulfilled when the goal is ahead of us.
The world wondered how our people would rescue the victims of the country.
In a few hours, the world saw that Indians had hurryed to help Nepal.
If we start working in our minds then the government and the government will work faster and the government workers will work faster and the goods will be celebrated by lifting the head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power to progress the country.
Last month, we had announced three livelihood insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people are engaged in the life insurance schemes in some way, but we have to take it forward further.
I want to put an idea in my mind, I want to put it before you.
In August, the festival of Raksha Bandhan is coming and the people of the country should start a strong mass movement before the festival of Raksha Bandhan and let the mothers and sisters of our country get the benefits of life insurance.
Let us all work together to fulfill this pledge.
When I speak of the voice of Mann Ki Baat, many people give me advice.
This time, many people have advised me to tell me something about the monsoon.
Thiruvananthas, Yogesh Tandekar of Nagpuri, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta are asking you to talk in your mind about the monsoon.
They have also given good ideas to their share.
Even in this rainy season you may have enjoyed drinking hot pakoda, bajji and salam with the tea that flourishes.
Just as the rays of the sun give us life, the rain also gives us strength.
Every drop of rain is worthy.
As a citizen and as a society, we must continue to develop the spirit of protecting every drop of water.
The water in the village should be used in the same way in the city should be used for urban use.
Whether it is vaccines or irrigation management or small ponds or lakes, we should protect every drop of water.
If you have to visit the birthplace of Gandhians, Borbandar, then if you can see his house, you can see a tissue of water stored inside his house 200 years old, in which rain water has been facilitated directly.
You must see this.
It has also been taken into consideration in that period.
We can't do this too
This must be transformed into a mass movement.
The village should be followed by this method.
Similarly, the greenery takes our eyes.
How charming is a green life
All these trees, plantations, gardens and parks transform life into greenery, don't they
We all have to implement tree plantation and movement related to it in this rainy season through social organisations and youth in a big way.
I give a suggestion from my own experience and this rural technology is a very successful one.
When you tremble the plant, put an old soil pot near the plant, fill it with water.
Due to the moisture in the environment, microbes are increasingly increasingly and health is very important.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is important to drink clean water.
Most people drink by boiling water in this season.
This also has good results.
The more we are concerned, the more we are protecting from diseases.
Water and rain are required, but it is also important to be safe from the disease moment.
Friends, We have now introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the Amrith Yojana, we have created a movement to make our cities fit to live.
In 2022, when India celebrates its 75th anniversary of independence, all Indians should have a house.
Keeping in mind these three things, we have started a big scheme.
It inspired all fathers to take a selfie photograph with their daughters and to register on social portals.
In Haryana, in comparison to male children, the rate of female children is very low.
There are 100 districts with such a worrying ratio in the country.
This is very high in the state of Haryana.
In some way, we have transformed the scheme Beti Bachao Padhao into a mass movement.
Watch out, you will realize how much the daughters' rise, proudness, Beti Bachao Abhiyan will give you happiness
Enjoy the rainy season
Make our country green
I say this experiencedly.
Take this forward.
The next time I meet you for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Sometimes some people think that I should inform about the welfare schemes of the government in my Mann Ki Baat programme.
This is my pleasure.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this interim period would have been spent.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the feeling that something has been released to me and that's yourself
But I thought it would be Sunday's event.
But I was awaiting when this Sunday will come.
Many have asked me why I had travelled to Kedarnath in the midst of the election campaign.
But if I started traveling in that direction then the voice of Mann Ki Baat could change.
That's why I got up when the election cycle spread, the estimations of success and the voting continued.
Many consider it a political instrument.
For me, I consider it as an opportunity to meet me.
In a way I'm going to meet myself.
I can't tell when I will do it, but I will definitely do it because it is my duty to tell you your right to know.
Just as the people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I have been consistently understanding your efforts to strengthen positive things in your words.
The inclusions found in Mann Ki Baat's letters are quite different from the customary government rule.
Sometimes your words are also opening the umbrella between my thought movements.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against hygiene, while collaborating with the efforts to make cleanliness.
If a person discusses the environment, he reflects his pain in it
But at the same time, he also mentions his efforts and describes his thoughts in his mind.
That is, in a way, a scene relating to how the solution to the problems can be inclusive to the entire society will be illuminated in his words.
Mann Ki Baat works as a glass for the country and society.
This shows that there is no shortage of determination, energy and capabilities of the people of the country.
It is necessary to coordinate those strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and to work in constructive efforts.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people of the country want to be strong and constructive in the progress of the country.
You can imagine that a person writes a letter to the country's prime minister, but he has not offered any application for himself...
... how excellent the feelings of millions of people in the country
When I examine all these things, I leave you to imagine how much joy I have and how excitement I have.
You are directing me, you are acting faster, you can't imagine that every moment you are pouring yourself to life in me...
Without this relationship, I was waiting for salvation.
Today, my heart is filled with happiness.
In this feeling, we will take the voice of Mann Ki Baat with a boon and humility.
When the state of emergency was created in the country, the struggles against it did not stop with political limitations and political leaders
It has not been imprisoned even among the prisoners.
There was anger in every citizen's mind.
There was a pace for the devastated democracy.
I don't know what hungry is when we don't eat food every day.
Likewise, whenever one knows about the rights of democracy in normal life and the joy that gives it, only when one breaks our democratic rights.
At the time of an emergency, every citizen from all over the country realised that something was ruined.
I can say that because of this tradition, India is a living society.
That is why the people of the country understood the lack of democracy and we felt this lack in the emergency.
Therefore, the country dedicated not for itself, but for the protection of democracy, not for the entire election.
When we are far away from any thing or object, we neglect the miracles of that thing, we calculate the importance of it.
In India, more than 61 crore people have voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
This number may seem to be simple to us, but if we have left China from the perspective of the world, more than the population of any country in the world has voted in this election.
The number of voters who voted in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 was more than the entire population of the United States and swiftly doubled, than the entire European population.
This reflects the vastness and widespreadness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election has been the world's largest democratic election in history so far.
You can imagine how much goods and human resources are required to manage such a huge election.
This has been possible as a result of the hard work of millions of teachers, officers and workers overnight.
It is because of the hard work of all of them that this time more voting has become a platform than the previous time.
In order to vote, about 10 lakh polling booths, more than 40 lakh polling machines and more than 17 lakh video packets across the country...
I leave the vastness of arrangements to your imagination.
All these were implemented to ensure that no voter should be denied the right to vote.
In a far-flung area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one polling booth was set up for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officials took two days to reach there.
This is the real respect given to democracy.
The polling booth in the world's highest place is located in India.
The poll is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahaul Spiti, Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another matter of pride in this election.
This is also the first time in history that women have participated with enthusiasm for men and women.
The percentage of voting for women and men in this election was almost similar.
One more enthusiastic thing about this is that today, the number of women members in the House is 78.
My dear countrymen, I have often heard you say that it is not potato-bugyal.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers on occasions like welcomes and honour.
Since then, people have started supplying books at many places.
Now one has given me a book titled Fremchand ji's famous story and I like it very much.
It has not been time for several days but due to his foreign visit, he has got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
Fremchand has described the reality of the society in his stories, while reading, these scenes start dwelling in your mind as paintings.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
Secondly, I touched the depths of my mind, whose name is Idgah.
The feeling of the compassion of a child, the clean love that he has with his grandson, and his compassionate mind at such a young age.
When he comes to his grandchildren from the 4-5-year-old Hamid Festival to buy a bread and gets a bread, the human spirit really touches the peak.
Likewise, the name of a song touching the heart is 'Pus Ki Rath.'
This story depicts a contradiction in the lives of a poor farmer.
Even after his farming has been destroyed, why is Haldu a farmer happy, because he does not need to sleep in his field in the cold of bone melting.
However, these stories were written about a century ago, but we can feel that these are still suitable.
After reading these things, I felt a unique experience.
I was reading in some media about Akshara Library in Kerala while talking about the learning.
At some time, they have also tied books with cords and brought them to the back.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to tribal children but also to all.
Gujarat's Wanje Gujarat movement is a successful effort.
All the old people participated in this movement to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of humil guru, I urge you to get some time for books to be a place between your daily customs.
Indeed, you will be very fond of this and write on the book read and on the NarendraModi App, so that the voice leaders of Mann Ki Baat can get information about it.
My heartfelt countrymen, I am glad to know that our people are thinking about things that can become challenges in the future and not stop with the present.
I was able to see that when I read the ideas of you in the NarendraModi App and MyGov, many people wrote about water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai from Belgavi and Siddhamso Mohan Barida from Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf, many others have written about water related challenges.
Water has a great importance in our culture.
It is said about water in the absorption of Rikveda - Apohista Moyobuva: Sthan Urje Dadhan, Maharanaya Sakshe, Yoga: Shivdamoras: Dasya Bajayadehna: Ushadhiriva Matra: Ushadhiriva Matara: Ushadhiriva Matara: Ushadhiriva Matara, Ushadhiriva Matara, Ushadhiriva Matara, Usadhiriva, Usadhi i. e.
You are equal to the mother, that is, mother is good for her blessings and suppress her compassion on us.
Water control affects many parts of the country every year.
You can be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water received from rainy season throughout the year can be stored in our country.
Only 8 percent.
Therefore, it is time to find a solution to this problem.
I am confident that with the help of peoples participation, with the opening of 130 crore people through Jan Shakti, with the help of collaboration and satisfaction, this problem can be resolved.
Considering the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country.
It will ensure that all matters related to water will be resolved at a rapid pace.
A few days ago, I had to do some things differently.
I gave a letter to the Panchayat leaders and the villagers of the country.
And I wrote to them that they should collect water, and keep every drop of rain water, and gather the village council, and join the villagers, and gather it in the consultation.
I am extremely happy that they have engaged in this work and on 22nd of this month thousands of panchayats and crores of people participated.
The people of the village are determined to save every drop of water and have contributed to their sex.
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to talk to you about a Panchayat leader.
The people of the state have once again prepared to fulfill their positive contribution for water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the villagers who have worked constructively from my side.
There are many leaders in the country who have challenged this kind of water storage.
In a way, this is an opportunity for the entire village.
I feel like the villagers are now engaged in the competition to raise the temple for some water in their villages.
As I have said, creative results are available through social efforts.
There is no one way to face the problem of water throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But the goal of all is to save water, to maintain water.
The sewage canals of Punjab are being improved.
This effort will get rid of the problem of obstacles.
There is a change in the lives of the villagers due to the setting up of water storage in Timmaiyapalli in Telangana.
There has been a major change due to the small ponds set up in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan.
When I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that 20,000 women were mobilized in the work of reviving the Naga river.
At the same time, I learnt about the women of the Garhwal region, who have worked hard to collect rain water in accordance with each other.
When people open one, water will be stored.
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I invite three requests to the people of the country.
My first urge - as the people of the country converted cleanliness into a mass movement, just like that, let us start transforming water conservation into a mass movement.
I believe that you are God's gift, it is a miraculous swimming rasamani.
It was said that Rasamani was iron and gold.
But the water is also such a rasamani, the touch of water produces new lives.
We need to create an awareness campaign for saving every drop of water.
Behold, my second request to the people of the country, many traditional methods of water conservation have been used for centuries in our country.
I urge you all to share these traditional methods with you all.
If anyone of you gets the opportunity to go to the birth place of a devoted rice in Borbandar, then there is a 200-year-old water reservoir in a house behind a water house.
Let us create a lot of water conservation list and inspire people to participate in water conservation.
You all share your views using JanShakti4JalShakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you and to the people of the world for another thing.
Many of the world's Presidents, Prime Ministers, fames and common citizens have shown me how Yoga is being taught in every country.
On that day, the world appeared as a happy family.
We know that there is a need for healthy and understanding persons to establish a healthy society.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Shouldn't you be honored for recognition of such service
In 2019, the announcement of the Prime Minister's Awards for the outstanding contribution of Yoga in the process and development of Yoga has given me an incredible form.
This award is conferred to the organisations that have contributed significantly to the spread of Yoga art across the world.
Japan Yoga Niketanam conducts several institutions and training courses there
Likewise, Ms.
He is an example of not conception.
When you come to know about the art of Yoga, tell us if India stays behind
These thousands of Yoga Days are specially associated with the spread of Yoga and the pride of all those who bring the message of Yoga to every household.
My heartfelt countrymen, our journey has started today, new feelings, new experiences, new determination, new openness.
Yeah, always wait for your suggestions.
We also meet us frequently, we are happy to interact.
I listen to your feelings, I gather, I understand.
At some points, I try to live according to those feelings.
Let your blessings continue.
You're my ideas, you're the one who gives me strength.
Let us join us, let us feel the voice of Mann Ki Baat, let us fulfill our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again we will meet again in the voice of Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, when the sound of Mann Ki Baat begins, my heart is imagined.
Ten days ago, Mother India has lost her brave friends.
These brave soldiers have lost their lives to protect all of us, 125 crore people.
Our brave friends have dedicated themselves to the people of the country for peaceful sleep.
The hearts of the people of the country are wounded after the martyrdom of our brave soldiers in Pulwama's extremist attack.
Condolences have come from four sides about the martyrs and their families.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country, who will save the mother of India, who will sacrifice their lives.
We must forget all the contradictions such as casteism, religiousism and regionalism that face this challenge before the nation and that is why our endeavours and decisions against extremism will be determined and harsh.
Our armed forces have always expressed their courage and valour to anyone.
On the one hand they have expressed their excellent ability to maintain peace, while reacting to the same language that can understand the attackers.
You can see how action has been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
Military forces have committed to root out Kelly and the extremists and their subsidiaries.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the media has widespreaded the words and ideas expressed by their relatives and strengthened the mental strength throughout the country.
Prasanna Sahu's wife Meena, a martyr from Jagat Singhpur in Odisha, respects the unlimited adventure all over the country.
He has acknowledged that his only son will join the Central Border Security Force.
When Vijay Shorena ji, who was fought with a three-colour flag, reached Kumla in Jharkhand, he said his son and son would work together with the army.
It is the favour of this pinch that today every child of India has been enhancing the feeling of a mixed feeling within the body and within the body.
Whether it is the martyr of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the father of Tilakraj, the martyr of Kangra, or the son of Hemraj, a six-year-old girl from Koda, is the story of every family of martyrs, the inspiration of the martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to know, know and understand the feelings that these families have shown and targets.
We don't need to revive the past steps of history to know what is patriotism, what is sacrifice and what is penance.
My beloved countrymen...
For so long after independence, we all waited for a war memorial, that waiting time will be over.
It is a natural thing for the people of the country to have the love and enthusiasm in this regard.
Shri Onkar Shetty, a resident of Udupi, Karnataka, has expressed his happiness over the creation of a National War Memorial at the NarendraModiApp.
It is surprising that no national level war memorial has been established in our country so far.
I wanted it to be a memorial decorated with the ruthless stories of the soldiers who had dedicated their lives for the protection of the country.
I am confident that such a memorial must be built in the country.
The second chakra symbolizes the valour, which reflects the courage and courage of the soldiers.
The walls of the seminar will be carved for the brave adventures of the soldiers.
After that, the sacrifice chakra
This cycle reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who gave Sarvabhariti for the country will be carved in golden papers.
After that, the Raksha Chakra symbolizes safety.
This cycle has a queue of dense trees.
It is impossible to contribute to the greatest contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the country's progress.
In October last year, I got a big blessing to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial is also a reflection of the spirit that we should be grateful to the men and women of our police who are engaged in safety at all times.
I am confident that you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, you must share the photographs you have taken there on the Social Web Site, which will inspire others to visit these sacred places.
My dear countrymen, for the voice of Mann Ki Baat, thousands of letters and ideas have gathered me in different ways.
This time when I was studying your views, I had attracted my attention an interesting idea of Adish Mukobhadya ji.
His age was only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on March 3, Jamsetji Data ji's birthday is also an accident.
He added that both of these men belong to the entirely unprecedented family background, but both of them have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, Birsa Munda and Jamsetji Data are equal to the respect of the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men have illuminated not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country.
The entire country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if we need a motivated person for guidance to our youth then he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British captured him while he was asleep as ruthless and naked.
Do you know why they took such a sorrow
Because the British who had established such a great empire were also scared of him.
Lord Birsa Munda, with the help of ambulances in his tradition, drives the British regime to use guns.
In fact, if there is a conceptional leadership for the people, the consciousness of society becomes bigger than the power of arms.
The destitute and the persecutors were taken from dark life to sunlight.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his 25-year life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Bharat Mata have emerged in all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled in everywhere, because they were not found anywhere in India as a part of the freedom struggle that had not contributed for centuries.
But fortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, surma and sacrifice do not reach new generations.
If people like Lord Birsa Munda have made us feel that people like Jamsetji Tata have provided great institutions to the country.
In fact, Jamsetji Tata ji was a visionary philosopher, who had not only seen the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that it would be the future requirement to make India a patron of science, technology and industry.
Because of his vision, the Tata Institute of Science was established and now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he established a number of trustworthy institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
This interaction resulted in the birth of the Indian Institute of Science.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai Ji is on 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
Accordingly, Morarji Bai, a peaceful man, is one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai, who dedicated the most budgetary report in the Parliament of India, will die on them.
At a very difficult time, Morjibai Desai took the leadership of India, in that time, the democratic system of the country was in great threat.
Morarji Bhai Desai ji dedicated himself to the urgency of preserving democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his employer.
The then government arrested him and held him in jail.
But when he won the Janata Party in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his reign, the 44th Constitutional Amendment was passed.
If this was important, the 42nd Constitutional Amendment was introduced to create an emergency, in which, apart from reducing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other conditions in it were ruined by our democratic values, they were regained.
That is, by the 44th Constitution Amendment, there was a criterion to empower the Parliament and the legislature to print the functions and newspapers.
For the first time, the proclamation of the Ordinance was made by the recommendations made by the Cabinet in writing and the period of emergency cannot be extended to more than 6 months in a way.
Morarji Bai assured them that the state of emergency was declared and how democracy was killed and killed in 1975, to prevent it from reconstructing.
His contribution to preserving the glory of Indian democracy is great and the generations will remember it forever.
Once again I offer my tributes to such a great leader.
They are creating a positive change in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their hard work.
They are the genuine karmayogis, they serve the country in a selfless manner than public service and social service.
When the Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen the people who will be awarded.
In a way, I consider this as a great success because they will not be seen in the cards of television and newspapers, who are away from the world of humility.
But those who don't have any concern that they should be named, those who believe in working on the ground.
Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam is a singer of the song.
I would like to share with you some of these people.
You must have been aware of the dadari dog of Odisha, there is no reason to call him the canal man of Odisha, Taidari Nayak ji has cut the mountain with his hands and built a canal route for three kilometres.
I gave him a commemorative gift to the Tree of Life painting created by Abdul Kafur.
Among the Padma awardees, Shapir Saiyat ji from Maratwada is known as the servant of the cow slave.
How he dedicated his entire life to the service of cow slaves is very unique and amazing.
Chinnaplai from Madurai, for the first time, made efforts to contribute to the oppressed and oppressed by the Tamil Nadu Flagrum Mission, and started socially economical structures.
Even after 100 years, he teaches people all over the world Yoga, so far 1500 people have been made Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu (Tudu), a well-known woman named Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has worked adventurously against tree robbers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares of forests and inspired tens of thousand women to protect trees and wildlife.
Because of this untiring hard work of Jamuna Ji, today all the villagers have planted 18 trees and 10 trees during the marriage of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Bihar's Muzaffarpur, is very thoughtful.
I am trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, wherever I go to the country.
Brothers and sisters, Over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefitted from this scheme.
I can see how big changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My countrymen who are sitting in my mind, the examinations are going to start in schools.
Various educational boards across the country will start board examinations for ten and twelve classes in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students, their parents and all the teachers who are going to take the exams.
A few days ago, a big event of Pariksha Bay Church in Delhi i.e. a discussion on examinations was held in the Town Hall.
One of the important features of the interaction with regard to examinations is that discussions are being held without restriction on various matters related to examinations.
Because we have thousands of years old culture and traditions.
A few days later, the holy day of Mahashivaratri is coming and this time when Shivratri comes on Monday, a special significance spreads smell in our hearts.
I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend some time with some of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Many things could be talked about with them, their self-confidence was really impressing and inspiring.
While addressing the gathering, I asked the youngsters with disabilities who are visually disabled, who is a platform artist and when I introduced myself to be a Mimmycreater in the Calicut events, I asked who will speak like you.
He said I will talk like the Prime Minister.
At the same time, when I showed something exactly, I was waiting for a comfortable surprising surprise, just as I would speak in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, he made the voice of Mann Ki Baat by Michri.
I am happy to know that not only people ask the voice of Mann Ki Baat, but also remember it on several occasions.
Indeed, I was very disappointed to see the power of these disabled youngsters and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through Mann Ki Baat has given me a unique experience.
In a way, I have been associated with crores of families every month through radio.
I feel that while talking to you several times, while reading letters you have written, when you hear your phone calls, you consider me as your family member.
This feeling reflects a comfortable experience in my mind, smells happiness.
Friends, Elections are the biggest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we will all be drowned in the election race.
I am also a candidate for this election.
To honour the healthy democratic tradition, the next Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday in May.
That is, in March-April, I will commence all my feelings of these three months, with a new faith after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will travel together for several years with the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Once again I express my gratitude to you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Sivakumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Sivakumar Swami will follow this philosophy.
In his 111-year life, he served thousands of people for social, education and economic development.
The widespreadness of his penetration was that of English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in the feeding of the people, humiliation, education and spiritual enlightenment.
Swamiji's main objective of life was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
The Siddhaganga Monastery is organising fairs for cows and farming in a regular manner.
I have often got the blessings of Swamiji for blessings.
Our former President, Dr. A.
During this occasion, Kalam Iya read a poem written for respected Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Iya describes the life of Sri Sri Sri Sivakumar Swamiji and the goal of the Siddhaganga Monastery in a beautiful way.
There is a more important institution in our country
This is more than the combined part of our democracy and our democracy - I speak of the Election Commission of India.
On 25th January, the foundation day of the Election Commission is celebrated as the National Voters Day.
Looking at the level of elections being held in India, the world is surprisingly putting a finger on the nose
Polling stations are being set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15000 feet and also in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You might have heard about Gujarat
In the Gir forest area, in a far-flung place, only one voter has been cast.
Imagine friends...
In order to get the opportunity to use the voter's ballot in mind, the entire team of Election Commission personnel go to far-flung areas to go to the polling system - this is the beauty of our democracy.
I heartily appreciate the Election Commission, which has been making continuous efforts to strengthen the democratic system.
I compliment the Election Commissions of all the States, all the security forces, independent and undiscriminatory personnel in the election work.
Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country this year
This is the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They will get the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are participants in the process of taking decisions for the country.
It is time to connect their dreams with the dreams of the country.
If you are eligible to vote, I urge young social friends to register your name on the voter list.
If we cannot vote for any reason in life, then we should feel that it is sad to us.
If we say something wrong has happened in the country then we should be griefed.
This activity must change ourselves naturally.
I urge the people of the country to create awareness by conducting a movement this time that we all react together to voters and vote on voting day.
I am confident that younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers, their contribution will be done for our democracy and will strengthen it further.
My dear countrymen, on this great land of India many times great people have emerged, such great people have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, he celebrated his birth anniversary in a new way.
On Netaji's birth anniversary, I got the opportunity to unveil a museum dedicated to the well-known soldiers who contributed to the freedom struggle of the country.
Inside the Red Fort, many such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
The Red Fort rooms that are closed have been transformed into excellent museums, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yaad-e-Jalian
The museum, which was established in memory of 1857 and Indias first freedom struggle, has been dedicated to this entire complex as a revolutionary temple.
Every brick in these museums enhances the aroma of our glorious history.
At this place, the British government prosecuted Indian mother's brave friends Colonel Prem Cycle, Colonel Gurpaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I took care of the memories associated with Netaji in the Revolutionary Temple of the Red Fort, one of the family members of Netaji gave me a very special gift.
Indeed, there is a need to bring the bravery and patriotism of our heroes to our new generations again and again in different angles.
About a month ago, on 30th December, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
At the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had flagged the Tricolor 75 years ago, I got the opportunity to fly the Tricolor.
On this occasion, the announcement regarding the Azad Hind Government came to the forum 75 years ago.
Subhas Babu will always be remembered as a brave military soldier and a skilled executive.
Such brave soldiers have contributed significantly to the freedom struggle.
Dilli Salo, give me a liberty and I give you freedom, Netaji will be able to remove the minds of every Indian with awakening and inspiration.
There has been a demand for several years to bring secret appeals to the public
I am very happy that we have done this work.
I don't think that the family members of Netaji had come to my house one day.
We together talked about several things related to Netaji and made a gift to Netaji Bose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Be it Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum, Granti Mantra, 26 associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
If you come to Delhi then you must visit these places.
My countrymen, while we are discussing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose today, I would like to share with you an event related to the life of Netaji in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I have always considered radio as an important media that connects with the people
I am told that this radio station has been broadcast once a week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urdu.
In this radio station management, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is significant.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people, and its events gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this Revolutionary Temple.
Efforts have been made to demonstrate Indian art and culture more attractively.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum where there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old.
The museum showcases excellent works of great artists like Amruda Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avnindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I would especially urge you all to visit there and see Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji's works.
Well, what is it talking about art, but you can imagine that going here you are talking about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's special works.
You all have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a composer and a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painter.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his majority works.
He said that the one who sees the picture should understand it himself and sees the message given by that painting in his own sight.
His paintings are shown in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I am confident that you will visit Granti Mantra and see his paintings.
My sinful countrymen, India is a land full of sacred people.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Chand Ravidas is such a sacred person.
Ravidas ji's birth anniversary on February 19.
In fact, if God dwells in all human beings, it is not appropriate to see him dividing into the forms of caste, religion and class.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Pilgrim Ravidas, through his message, tried to understand the importance of hard work and labour in his entire life.
It would not be surprising if he explained to the world the truth of the importance of labour.
I once again pay my respects to the saint Ravidas Ji.
My dear countrymen, MyGov Kiren Siddar ji has requested the Indian Space Department to speak in the voice of Mann Ki Baat about the dimensions related to its future.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed immensely to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
It is a heartfelt thing that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets to reach space.
On 24th January this year, Kalamsat was launched by our students.
Sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also given fame.
In the last four and a half years, all the space missions have been carried out since independence in 2014.
We have achieved 104 satellites in the same space.
We will soon register Indias presence in the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 Mission.
Our country is using space technologies in a very important way for the protection of life bodies.
Space technology is sufficiently assisting all these cyclones, rail and road safety.
NAVIC equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which protects them and helps economic development.
We are using space technologies to fulfil government service delivery and responsibilities in a better way.
Under the Housing Scheme for All, about 40 lakh houses have been given geo-tacks in 23 states.
Besides, under the Mahatma Gandhi Grameen Area Employment Scheme, about three and a half crore assets have also been geo-tacked.
Our satellites today mark the growing strength of the country.
It is because of its contribution that we have made excellent links with many countries of the world.
There is a unique endeavour of South Asia Satellite, which gives respect to the development of our neighbouring friendly countries.
India is launching satellites not only of developing countries but also of developing countries through its excellent competitive missile services.
The heavens and the sky have always been attractive to the children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to take the boundaries across the boundaries.
Our children are enthusiastic and are inspiring to find new stars and provide a vision.
My beloved countrymen, I have always said that those who play, they grow and blossom and this time the sportspersons who are united in Khelo India have shineed.
In January, about 6000 sportspersons participated in 18 Games for Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
If the sportsperson at the local level works well, he can understand the best in the world.
This time, sportspersons from all States in Khelo India have shown their talent very well.
He lives in a car with his family.
Likewise, Captain Sonali Helvi of the Kabadik Committee of Maharashtra is living in Sadar for women under the age of 21.
He has lost his father at a very young age, his brothers and his mother have given confidence to Sonali and inspired him.
We have often seen that women do not get much encouragement in sports like Kabdi.
But after all this, Sonali chose Kabadi and worked well.
Abinav Shah, a 10-year-old ASENSOL, has been proud to win a gold medal at the youngest age in the games of Khelo India.
Akshada Vaswani Kanti, daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, has won a gold medal in the weightlifting category.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But was he asked about the competition to brighten the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique competition that has been going on for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is clean and beautiful toilet.
People used to enhance their toilets as well as beautified and comfortably awakened by paintings, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrup, a large number of photographs of clean beauty toilets are found on social web sites.
I urge all the Panchayat leaders and the villagers to take the leadership of such a movement in your Panchayat.
You must share the picture of your clean beautiful toilet with MyIzzatgarh on the Social Web Site.
Friends, With the aim of cleaning the country and getting rid of the habit of open defecation, we have made a memorable journey to remember the 2nd October 2014.
Due to the cooperation of the people of India, today, 2nd October, 2019 has been moving forward in the direction of getting rid of the habit of open defecation, so that we can pay tributes to the 150th birth anniversary of water.
The contribution of the voice leaders of Mann Ki Baat in this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat is also important and that is why I am happy to share this thing with you that when more than 5. 5 lakh villages and 600 districts have been freed from the habit of open defecation, they have reached 98 per cent of the Swachh Bharat hygiene in rural India and about 9 crore families have been provided toilets.
My little friends, the days of examination are coming closer.
Anshal Sharma, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, has asked me to talk about the examinations and the exam warriors.
Ansul ji, I thank you for presenting this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is the election time for many families.
Students, their parents and teachers are all involved in examination related activities.
This time, students from many overseas are also participating in the event.
In this Pariksha Bay Church, I am talking to all the aspects related to the examination, especially our young friends about the unconscious examination.
For this, I have asked many people to send insights and ideas.
I am happy that a large number of people are sharing their views in MyGov.
I will surely present some of these ideas and suggestions during the Down Hall event.
You must participate in this event.
You can also see its direct broadcast through social media and Namo App.
May the 2019 journey be successful.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
It is then that we will have the benefits of experience and the confidence that we have to do something new.

All these have been linked to the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore people.
Jayachandran joined Goddess.
People say that he was always keen to provide treatment to patients.
Likewise, Sulakitti Narasamma from Karnataka also joined God on 25th December.
Sulakitti Narsamma helped in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was awarded the Padma Shri award.
While we talk about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of our party told me that some young doctors were camping in the city and providing free treatment to the poor.
Every month many poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The zeal of these medical friends who are engaged in service with selfless feelings is indeed commendable.
Today, I would like to say that because of social efforts, the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people have joined the Swachhta Abhiyan at one time.
In this Mahayana of Swachhta, all the stakeholders of municipality, volunteers, students of schools and colleges and people of Jabalpur participated with great enthusiasm.
The success stories of innovative youth and entrepreneurs have been detailed in commy.
Well, will we do a job

With this, the elderly people will know about our heroes who make changes in the society.
There is a great importance for sports in all society.
When playing, it is full of strength in the minds of those who see it.
We feel a lot of things like the name, identity and respect of the sportspersons.
However, in some cases, there are many things in the backdrop of these things more than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanaya Nisar, a girl from Kashmir, who has won a gold medal in the Karathe competition in Korea.
Hanaya, a 12-year-old girl, belongs to Anantnag in Kashmir.
Karate was trained due to Hanaya's hard work and strides, he knew it minutely and made it a record.
On behalf of all the people, I wish his future to be bright.
Many good wishes and good wishes to Hanaya.
Like this, you must have read a lot of news in the media about Rajni, a 16-year-old girl.
Rajni has won a gold medal in the younger category in the women's wrestling competition.
After winning Rajni's medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani roamed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajni drink a cup of milk, all of you think, didn't you
He did this to pay homage to his father Jasmer Singh and he is selling luxury at a shop in Panipat.
Rajani later said that his father had made a great sacrifice to achieve this situation and had tolerated many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
Vedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old boy from Pune this year, became the first Asian woman in the bicycle to strengthen the world at a rapid pace.
He travelled 159 days at a rate of about 300 km per day.
His unprecedented interest in cycling is really commendable.
Are we not conceived when these achievements are heard about such successes
The names of all these festivals may be different but it is a feeling of celebrating everything. These festivals are somehow linked to harvest and fodder, connected to the farmers, connected to the villages and integrated to the crops.
At this time, the time for the sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sand.
After this, gradually the day begins to grow and the harvesting of cold winter crops starts.
My warm greetings to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The smell of unity in diversity - Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is spread through our festivals.
We can see how close relations our festivals and festivals have with nature.
Many of our festivals have been enhanced in the spirit of maintaining rivers and water.
On the day of the sacred sacred sacred sun is worshipped in rivers and waterfalls.
Millions and millions of people bath in the sacred rivers during Makar Sankranti.
Share the pictures you have taken during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the beauty of India's diversity and its culture.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is a great dimension, the more divine is filled with glory.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
In Kumbh, people come to the sea with faith and devotion.
At one time millions of people from foreign countries join one place.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela will enhance our great cultural wood.
This time the world famous Kumbh Mela, which will be organised in Prayagraj starting on January 15, is looking forward to you all.
Saints and saints have started coming to Kumbh Mela.
We can calculate the importance of the Kumbh last year by linking UNESCO to the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity's close cultural heritage.
A few days ago, the embassies of many countries visited the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
The flags of many countries were blown up at the same time.
There is a possibility of people coming from more than 150 countries to participate in this Kumbh organized in Prayagraj.
With the divineity of the Kumbh, the glory of India will enhance its glory in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is one of the biggest instruments to realise itself and every person who comes here has a different experience and sees and understands the spiritual things of the world.
This gives the youngsters an opportunity to shining as a great learning experience.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I could see the arrangements for the Kumbh Mela being held very critically.
People from Prayagraj are seen with great enthusiasm for Kumbh Mela.
There I dedicated the Integrated Command and Control Centre, Integrated Command and Control Centre to the people.
Cleanliness along with difficulty in organisations will also reach the remote areas.
This time devotees can also perform the sacred darshan of Akshayvada after the sacred bath in the Sangam.
The symbol of the faith of the people, this Akshayavatha has been stuck in the fort for thousands of years, so that the devotees could not see it even if they wanted it.
Now the doors of Akshay Vadam have been opened for all.
May this spiritual Kumbh be the pride of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the glory of the nation.
May this Kumbh of the devotees become the fountain of the world's tourists.
The blessed Bapu had a link with South Africa.
Mohan and Mahatma are in the same South Africa.
In South Africa, Gandhiji started his first Satyagraha and gave a resolution against diversity.
He established Phoenix and Tolstai farms, from where the voices of peace and justice began to float all over the world.
He was given the patience and inspiration to spend several years in jail from a compassionate brother.
Do you know what Mandela ji said about brotherhood, "If the Gandhians were an incredible part of our history, he had done his first test with the opportunity here
This is where he clearly expressed his commitment to justice
This is where he has forgotten the way of his Satyagraha philosophy and struggle.
He made his brother a model.
And Mandela is a source of inspiration for the world and their goals always inspire us to build a society of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a conference of Director Generals of Police was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where there was a meaningful discussion with the senior police officers of the country.
There were detailed discussions on how efforts should be made to further strengthen the security of the country and the people.
Sardar Patel ji dedicated his entire life to the unity of the nation.
He was always involved in building India's integration.
Sardar Patel ji believed that the power of the country of India was inspired by the unity of diversity.
With this award we can pay homage to Sardar Patel ji for this spirit.
My dear countrymen, Guru Gobind Singh ji's holy birth anniversary on January 13.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
To a large part of his life, his work was in North India and he joined the Nanted in Maharashtra.
The birthplace of Patna and its functions are in North India and the last moments of life in Nanded.
In a way, the entire India has received his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh got the courage to fight for justice from Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weaker, injustice was done against them, Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a voice to the poor and the weaker, and fought shoulder to shoulder with determination.
He said, "Moti with the vulnerable people cannot express their power.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it was a great service to seduce the sorrows of humanity.
He was a man of valour, sympathy, sacrifice and guidance.
Besides, Gurugugi, Brajbhasha, Samskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu were also specialists in many languages.
Once again I salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
My heartfelt countrymen, there are many events that have not been discussed in the country.
FSSAI is such a distinct attempt.
Celebrations are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhijis.
Healthy India journeys are being undertaken through the Eat Rift India Mission for Regulatory Food India.
When India becomes clean and healthy then it is self-reliant.
It is important for good health to have nutritious food.
Knowledge of the importance of food is important since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the concluding event of 2018 that we will join again in the year 2019 and reinforce our minds.
Whether it is a personal life or a life of the country or a life of society, the inspiration is the source of development.
Let us move forward, let us see changes and changes in the country, let us see new inspiration, new motivation, new successes and new heights.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On the 3rd of October 2014, on the 3rd of Vijaya Dasamith, we all travelled together through Mann Ki Baat.
This time most of the letters and phone calls from you have come to this 50th place.
In MyGov, Ansu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Patna, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Delhi, Prasenjit Sarkar from Burdwan in West Bengal, Sangeeta Sastri from Nagpur etc.
Your interest is natural.
In today's times, when almost forgotten the radio, why is Modi connecting through radio
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working on the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
I was going to a place in May.
Take a laddy kept in his vessel, and eat laddy first before tea is ready.
I was surprised to hear what happened, what happened to anyone in the house like marriage.
No, you don't know
I'm the only one who's supposed to be.
Behold, you will listen to the first radio.
Then he was talking about it in the radio.
In this forest area, amidst the snowy mountains, a common man sells tea for himself and listens to radio throughout the day.
Therefore, when I was the Prime Minister, I was not surprised to return my attention to the most powerful media radio milk.
Mann Ki Baat has inspired the movement of Mann Ki Baat from far-flung villages to cities, from farmers to young entrepreneurs.
Every month lakhs of letters were read, phone calls were heard, criticisms were made in the app and MyGov
The journey of these 50 territories, which have been connected with all these in a very interesting manner, has joined us to this journey.
At present, All India Radio and Mann Ki Baat have also undertaken a study.
Some of the backgrounds found in it are very interesting.
Those who have been studied, 70 percent of them are constantly asking the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The creation of a positive spirit in the society is considered to be the greatest contribution of the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Peoples movements have been inspired by the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
There has been widespread discussions on Indipositive.
All these underscore the positive spirit and positive sentiment in the minds of our people.
People are sharing their feelings that self-confidence has increased due to the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The idea of social service is a big change in the minds of the people.
But people are not connected to this event only through Moli.
Besides television, F Employees, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Direct Broadcasting, Periscope, people of Mann Ki Baat are making their contributions through Narendra Modi App.
I express my warm gratitude to all the families of Mann Ki Baat for believing the voice of Mann Ki Baat and turning it into a part of it.
Your doubt is right.
At the end of their study, this event was also a political unpro-political decision.
When Mann Ki Baat started, I had decided that it should not be political or laying the back of the government, Modi should not be seen anywhere in it.
Appearances of leaders in letters, journals and phone calls that came before every Mann Ki Baat were clearly known.
Modi will come and go, but this country will remain sustainable and our culture will be destroyed by the time.
Small stories of 130 crore countrymen will still be hidden.
I read the letter, if this essence had been published in another letter, I would like to communicate with it.
Besides, I share my experience and share with you.
No government can have the power to spread and spread awareness in the country and abroad from a small village in Haryana.
When every field of society and popularity is connected, it is said in a new definition of thinking change in society, then today's generation understands it and there is an unaware awareness of the eyes.
India's Andamana is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one of which is political.
If everything happens in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy community.
At some points political events and politicians dominate, the other capabilities and other efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thank you for your phone call.
In a way, you've been heard because of your confession.
If I have to answer directly to the question you asked, I am not involved in any manufacturing group.
In fact, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is a very simple job for me.
People's letters come before every Mann Ki Baat.
That letter is not just a paper for me
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint and have visited most parts of the country and have spent a significant time in the remote districts of the country.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the voice is mine, but examples, emotions and feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to tell the migrations of lakhs of such people in the voice of Mann Ki Baat till date, but without any disappointment of these things, I have been reciting their letters and their views.
I am confident that your ideas will contribute to me more than ever before, to make the mindset more interesting and more influential.
Efforts are being made to make the concerned department concerned about those letters and ideas which have not been included in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other television and social workshops.
In this way, they will become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude to all of them for their capabilities and capabilities.
I would also urge you to release this event in your state languages.
Any politicalist will never be happy with the media, it is only a very low correspondence, it is also negative.
But the media made many things raised in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, road safety, narcotics, India and daughter-in-law have taken up several things like a self-proof with the media in innovative ways and has been transforming it into a movement.
If you had no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Finance ji, thank you for your phone call.
If you want to tell the truth, I have no secret.
It becomes easier to understand anyone until the old ages in our lives are not undermined.
At times, we talk about the difference between the elders in the family and the adult people.
In fact, it is less to talk to most adults.
I have always been trying to interact with the youth through specific events and social portals.
I have always been trying to learn from what they do or what they think.
Through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have been trying to give greater importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time for the youngsters to waste this thing helps the youngsters to create more innovations because they think to finish the tasks quickly.
We feel that today's youngsters are very talented and are thinking about big things.
Well, let them have great dreams and make great successes.
Some say that younger generations want to do many things at the same time.
I hear what's wrong with this
Scientists do many works at the same time.
If we look around us, be it social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports and other fields, the youngsters and the youngsters who transform the society.
These youngsters start questioning, have the power to dream.
If we put the ideas of the youth on the ground, if we provide an independent environment to shape them then we can make a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinita Ji in MyGov, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about the Constitution Day to be held on 26th November.
It is important that this day, he has registered that in the 70th century we have accepted our Constitution.
Winita ji, I thank you for your advice.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is the day we think of the people who have given us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on 26th November, 1949.
The Constitution has taken two years, 11 months and 17 days to complete this historical task which was drafted by the Constitution.
Just imagine, within three years, these dignitaries have made us such a comprehensive and profound constitution.
The rapid pace that they have enacted the State Infrastructure Act is still an example of time governance and productivity.
We are also convinced to fulfill our responsibilities at a time bound manner.
The specialty of our Constitution is that it is detailed about the rights and duties.
It is a memorable event to enhance the awareness of the Constitution between the youth and connect them with the various dimensions of the Constitution.
As a Republic in 2020, we will complete 70 years of our journey and we will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Let us all take the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity, peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, whenever we talk about the Constitution, we should never forget the contribution of that human being at the centre of the Constitution.
That man is a respectable doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On December 6, his Mahabari Nirvana day i.e. he became Amar.
I pay my tributes to Baba Saheb all over the country and he has gained the right to live with dignity for millions of Indians.
Democracy is an integral part of Baba Saheb's nature and India's democratic value is not imported from outside.
Democracy and Parliament are not new things for India.
My servants shall pay homage to Babasaheb, one more respectable thing.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, Guru Nanak Dev ji's birth anniversary was celebrated and next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought about the welfare of humanity.
He always pushed the path of opportunity, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been asked to take this day very well.
Similarly, the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all countries around the world.
And there will be a train on the path of Guru Nanak Dev having holy places along with him.
Now when I was participating in a meeting related to it, I was reminded of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the earthquake in Gujarat in 2001, Gurudwara had a major impact.
But the state government has revived it in collaboration with those regional people is still an example.
My brother-in-law countrymen, after the 50th part of Mann Ki Baat, we will meet again in the voice of Mann Ki Baat and I have got the opportunity to reflect the feelings in the backdrop of Mann Ki Baat for the first time.
The more I connect with you, the more our journey will be deeper and joyful to all.
The question of what I got from the voice of Mann Ki Baat can be raised in the minds of some people.
Today, I would like to tell you that the references made by me through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, one of these touches my heart, and when everyone in the family sits together and listens to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, our family leader sits with us and shares with us about our things.
Your comfort, my comfort.
Your expectations, my hopes.
Your aspirations and my aspirations.
Come, let us take this journey further.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October is the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the 'Ekta Run' programme.
Climate is very lukewarm now.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in the unity movement.
About six months before independence, on 27 January 1947, the world-renowned international newspaper 'Tim' was released with the photograph of Sardar Patel on its first side.
Indias map has also been published in the headlines of that newspaper
But that map is not like now.
In that map, India showcased a piece of pieces.
It consists of more than 550 positions.
When they left the country, they were thinking that India should be pieces of pieces.
The Times commented that India faces various threats such as division, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
At the same time, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was able to unite the country and heal the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article also reflected on the other side of the history of life of India's iron man.
In the article, when there was a flood in Ahmedabad by 1920, he handled relief measures and carried out the Birtholi Satyagraha.
He had so much sincerity and determination that he had full faith in the farmers, workers and business leaders.
Sardar Patel took up every problem to integrate the country, just like wearing the wall through a single-writing fear.
He assured that all the estates in the country are connected to India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram, be it Rajasthan, if we can see an integrated India now, then Sardar Patel's intellectual and vision is the main reason for this.
This statue, built on the banks of the Narmada river of Gujarat, is twice as high as the idol of America's freedom goddess.
This will be the world's tallest launch statue.
Every Indian will be proud of the world's tallest statue being built in India.
Sardar Patel, the real son of our soil, will decorate our space.
I am confident that this statue, which has been honoured by the mother of India, will make every Indian proud.
Because the desire to see the statue of unity is natural in the minds of every Indian.
I am confident that this statue will be a destination for people across the country.
My dear brothers and sisters, We all celebrated Kalatbhadai Day yesterday.
I salute all those who are part of Indias defence forces.
I salute the families of our soldiers.
You should know why we are celebrating Kaladapada day today.
Indian troops took foot in Kashmir today and saved the valley from being in the grip of occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview of our respected army officer Sham Maneksha.
In this, Field Marshal Sham Maneksha recalled the time he was the Governor.
At that time, military operations started in Kashmir.
In a meeting held at that time, Field Marshal Maneksha noted how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had bitten for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir, and indicating that there should be no delay in sending troops, and to resolve the problem quickly, Sardar Patel gave clear instructions to him.
And if our troops flew to Kashmir then we can know how our army has successfully worked.
The commemoration day of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
Let us pay homage to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who would not like sports
If our youth have these capabilities, then our country will not only grow in the field of economic and scientific technology but also explore pride in sports.
I was very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their insistence in breaking the obstacles and gaining success will inspire all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got a great opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Summer Olympics in Argentina.
You know that the functioning of our youth in the 2018 Summer Olympics has been unprecedented so far.
We got 13 medals and three medals in the Mixed Double Competition.
You must reflect that the recent Asian Games are the best of Indian sportspersons.
You must have noticed that I have repeatedly mentioned the word "Best or Unprecedented Receipt".
This is a reality that reflects the progress made in the sports sector of India every day.
Not only in the field of sports, India is creating new achievements in the field of innumerable sectors.
For example, I would like to point to you the disabled sportsperson Narayan Bhatur, who won the Gold in the 2018 Asian Games for Divyangjans.
He's an individual, born.
He lost his father when he was eight.
After that, he lived at home for eight years without support.
He then came out of the house, and had worked for cleaning the buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and working on the roadside restaurants.
Narayana has won the medal on behalf of India in the international event.
It should also be noted that the Indian sports sector is at a rapid pace.
Moreover, India has not won the junior or Chinese medal in the Judo event so far.
However, India's father-in-law has won the silver medal in Youth Olympics and has achieved historical achievements.
Tapabi Devi, who is 16, belongs to a village in Manipur.
His father is a simple worker, mother is doing fish business.
It's also a time when there is no money to buy food items.
In such a poor situation, his zeal and dedication have not been reduced.
He has made history by winning medals for the country.
The entire world appreciated the success of this competition.
The World Cup Competition for FIFA 17 years of age has achieved a record in the number of persons watching on the ground.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have seen football competitions in sports venues in different parts of the country and have inspired youngsters.
This year, we have got the opportunity to host the 2018 World Cup manual hockey competition in Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition is scheduled to be completed on November 28 and December 16.
Every Indian, whether he is interested in any sports or sports, will certainly be interested in the hockey competition.
In the hockey sports, India has achieved records of golden sports.
India has won gold medals in various events and won the World Champion medal once.
India has also created a number of best hockey players.
Whenever we cited the hockey game, we cannot finish it without mention of our achievements.
Major Dhyanchand, considered to be the father of Hockey, is famous all over the world.
Further, Bulbir Singh Scientific, Lesley Cladies Mohammad Shahid, from Uttam Singh to Dhanrajpalle, has a long tradition of Indian Hockey.
Even today, the soldiers present in the Indian team are inspired by the younger generation due to their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see very charming competitions.
Go to Bhubaneswar and encourag every brave Indian team playing there.
Orissa is not only a historical background but also a rich state of cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very humiliated.
This is a rare opportunity for sportspersons to see Odisha.
You can also enjoy sports competitions along with the world famous pilgrimages of Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian mankind who participated in this competition and assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams participating in this competition from different countries of the world.
My dear countrymen, the morale of those who come forward for social work is indeed an inspiration and enthusiasm for all the people of the country.
But in the present new era, new generations are innovative and enthusiastic with innovative methods that can fulfil their dreams.
I participated in the inauguration ceremony of a new portal called "Samudhi I", which has been launched by my Government and the information technology and electronics industry of the country to provide opportunities for workers to work in this field and to encourage them to work in social activities.
Their dedication and bravery will make every Indian proud.
I don't - we, the change has created a new ecosystem for social work from individuals to individuals.
Some are teaching to old people
Some have dedicated themselves to the cleanliness work and some have helped the farmers.
But they have no perspective behind anyone's action and are inspired by their determination.
However, one who learns to sit in a wheel chair and play in a pilgrimage can help the disabled sportspersons who wear a wheel chair and wear a disabled sportsperson.
This feeling and dedication is an activity.
This will make every Indian proud.
I am not - we will certainly be attractive to all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, When you saw the suggestions given to Mann Ki Baat today, the idea of Shri Manish Mahbhadra from Puducherry was very encouraging.
The Mann Ki Baat App has said how tribals and their traditions and rituals are an example of the natural environment.
He said how to pursue the tradition of tribals in our lives and achieve sustainable development and know from such traditions.
I congratulate you all for presenting this issue among the leaders of Mann Ki Baat.
This will inspire us to understand our glorious past and ancient traditions when the entire world, especially the Western countries, discussing the environmental protection and explore new ways to adopt a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing the same problem.
But if we want to solve it, we must remember our past and know our traditional heritage, especially the way of living of our tribal people.
Living with close cooperation with nature is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people.
Our tribal brothers and sisters bow to God as trees, vegetations and flowers.
The tribal people living in Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are planting trees of Bipal and Arjun.
Fishnoi classes living in the desert area of Rajasthan are guiding us to protect the environment.
They are ready to give their lives, especially in the matter of protecting trees, rather than damage to a tree.
The Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh are associated with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the LTTE becomes forest protection.
The Warli community of Maharashtra considers the LTTE as its guests, and they consider the presence of the LTTE as a reflection of their prosperity.
The Gole ethnic of Central India considers the LTTE to be directly connected to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be prevailing.
The Gond community of Central India also stops fishing in the Kaithan river during the fishing period.
Those who consider this area as a fish sanctuary, think that they will get nutritional fish in large quantity due to this belief among themselves.
At the same time, tribals are also making their homes with strong and environment friendly natural products.
The Dodar community living in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of Southeast is setting up their habitations only with the items available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony to the fact that the tribal people believe in living very peacefully and compassionately and they do not hesitate to fight for their rights if they try to harm or harm their natural resources.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were the leading soldiers and tribals.
No one can forget Lord Birsa Munda, who fought hard against British imperialism to protect their forest area.
Besides this, I can list a large number of tribal communities who have educated us about how to collaborate with nature, and we are extremely grateful to our tribal people for the continuation of the forests in the country.
Everyone should come forward to express their gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we mentioned individuals and institutions who have played a significant role in the Mann Ki Baat programme for the society.
However, these works are not enough, but they have inspired deep feelings in our thoughts to show a new way to work for the society.
Just a few days ago, I read about the farmer brothers of Panchayat Kurbachan Singh.
The son of the farmer brother, Kurbachan Singh, who worked hard, is going to be married.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told the grandfather's parents that this marriage should be done in a very simple manner.
He said there is no need to spend a huge amount for marriage reception or any other matter.
He said that this should be considered as a very ordinary philosophy, and has suddenly imposed a condition.
It is a condition that women should ensure that their crops will not be burnt in the land and the waste will not be burnt.
You must consider the social strength of this idea well.
However, it shows how high his well-being is, and how many families of our society can solve their personal problems in a way that benefits the entire society.
Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh's family has shown us such an example.
I also learnt about the village of Kalarmajra near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning potholes, the village of Kalmajra has come to light by the farmers who followed new technologies to mix them with soil.
Greetings to Kurbachan Singh
Congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and all those who do not have any pollution in their surroundings.
You all have been the real way forward to the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
Just as the sea is formed by the consumption of small drops of water, every creative activity needs to create a good environment.
My dear countrymen, our ancients also mention this: 'Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Every soul in me and in you, every heart and this valour must be peaceful everywhere.
Oh, calm: calm.
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by golden editions.
For India, on 11th November this year, it is important because the first World War was concluded hundred years ago on 11th November.
It feels that when the war is over 100 years, it will be 100 years after the end of disasters and human lives.
First World War is very important for India.
In fact, we don't have direct contact with that war.
However, our soldiers have fought with courage and made great sacrifices in that war.
Indian soldiers have also explained that if there is a war, Indians are not slaughtered to anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and courage in difficult areas and bad weather.
The only purpose was to create peace.
The world knows that there were massive deaths and commodities during World War I.
It is reported that about one crore soldiers and innocent people have died in the same way.
That is why the entire world has realized the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace is not only war, but also requires global cooperation and integration to resolve terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poorest of the poor will be a real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a special specialty.
The people of the region are very talented in the natural beauty of the Northeast.
The Northeast is now famous for its excellent performance.
The North Eastern Region has made significant progress in organic farming.
In order to promote sustainable food habits, the State of Sikkim has received the Gold Award for the precious Future Policy 2018 a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has also won the award, postponing the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this.
I am confident that such festivals will be an opportunity to accept new pledges.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you grow, this country will also grow.
My best wishes to you all.
