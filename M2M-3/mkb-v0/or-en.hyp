And sometimes, if I see the texts of history together - India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.

And from 1942 to 1947, in five years, there was a mass mindset that was accomplished by a resolution, successfully became the cause of independence for the country.
This five years were decisive.
Now I would like to connect you with this memorial.
It took about 70 years.
I am sure I am sure.
The voice is not of a person but the voices of 250 crore people of the country echo from the walls of the Red Fort.

I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the upcoming festivals.

The villagers decided to build toilets in this Ramzan.
If our handwriting is bad, then we have to make a lot of careful effort to improve it.

Cleanliness is also the same.
So what was the goal
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail at that time.
But for the first time I got the opportunity to participate in the rains.
Our soldiers, where thermal power is 20, 25, 40, degree Celsius, also practiced yoga in Siachen.
In this context, I came to know that the Government of India has started a scheme called Government e-Arketplace.
I tried to know what it was. I also asked some people.
They will see what the quality of the supplier is being paid at affordable prices.

This will end the brokerage and transparency will come.
Therefore, all the government departments are watching those who are registered in the e-GE.

I once again wish you all the best.
Last time when I talked about Mann Ki Baat, I told the youngsters especially to do some new things, come out of the Comfort One and create a new experience.

But what I have seen in a total way - someone has tried to learn music, some people have tried to learn new things through YouTube.
Somebody has tried to learn some new languages, somebody has started learning cooking, learning dance, learning drama.
Some have written that they have started reading poems.
Afterwards you will see that when you are associated with natural conditions, a new consciousness will be awakened within you.

I don't know whether I can do it or not.
Keeping in mind the colors of the agriculture sector, the green dustbin will be remembered.
He became the first Indian to receive the Champions of the World Award.
But after such a long experience I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not think that this Mann Ki Baat programme has made me a civilization of every family of India.
Two days ago, President, Vice President, Speaker, Analytical Book of Mann Ki Baat released at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
Thank you.
I did not even think that in our country, especially the youth have been working for a long time.
We know that some social institutions have been doing this work for several years but the youth of my country are engaged in this work.
My best wishes to the citizens of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have made constant efforts to cross new heights of progress.
My best wishes to these two states.
Just a few days ago, Shri Vishva Bhai from Gujarat gave me one of his words - Save the Sparrows, in which he expressed his grief over the reduction in the number of households, along with what he himself used for their conservation, what he tried and explained these things very well.
This was also placed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
At times, we are so busy that we forget that we should give water to the newspapers or the climate, the milk delivery cow, the postman or any other person who comes to our house.
But most of the people visit the comfortable complex and now the tests have been conducted.
It is also comfortable for us to comfort.
But as a friend of you, I give some suggestions about how you will speak about it.
I am confident that some of you will use it and write letters to me.

The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not only the first person of the Asian continent to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British also divided him into a night degree and when the British took part in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath was one of the same personalities and great men who ruled his voice against the British government and had a profound impact on a twelve-year-old child.
In adolescence, a small child playing in artificial gardens awakened a new inspiration from the Jaliwanawala Bagh field and in 1919, the 12-year-old boy loved Bhagat is a source of inspiration for us - Shahid Bhagat Singh.
Earlier on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh, his colleagues, Sukhdev and Rajguru, were handed over to the British government and everyone knows that on 23rd March there was a feeling of fear of serving Bharatmata (Ma Bharati) in the mouth of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.

The power of the society is felt during the festival itself.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot look at the exams in a proper way.
This is a question of life and death.
The exams you are going to give are the tests that you have read for the year.

A country like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made significant progress in start-ups.
This digital event is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters, with new technologies and new technologies, with the emphasis on this sector, have to be fully linked to the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.

But when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to mislead you.
Their capabilities were identified.
Today they have once again accepted this challenge and I am confident that the resolve and inclusive efforts of the 125 crore Indians will establish this nation as a new energy.
But the misfortune is so widespread that some people still do not have a bad habit.
Even today, some people feel that the money of this corruption, this money, this amount of money, this amount of money, this amount of benami will be brought to the system once again.
They have gone illegally to protect their wealth.
It is a matter of sadness that they also liked the way to use the poor in this regard.
Some people are trying to save the money by misleading the poor, by depositing the money in their accounts or by doing some work by them.
A lot of laws have been enacted for Benami Property and there will be a lot of difficulty in the system.
Whether the countrymen have any problem or not, the government wants it.

Deepawali's Deepawali societies have the shadow of darkness and the darkness of the evil individuals is the festival of the light of Deepawali.
One thing we all know very well that if we go to any place in India, if we go to a rich person's house, if we go to the poorest of the poor, on the occasion of Deepawali, every family will get to see the cleanliness drive.
I mean that the festival of light Diwali is going to become a source of inspiration for the people of the world from darkness to light direction.

But Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that the anger that the citizens of the country have a huge value.
This time, a few people would be aware of how these Divyangjans have shown their valour in the Paralympics.
Not only this, I was surprised that those among the Divyangs who stayed in fourth place and did not get any medals took less time from the medal winners of the general category.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, greetings to those who have tried to do this.

A Shriyukta Ajit Singh has written in the NarendraaodiApp: Let's say about the education and participation of daughters in Mann Ki Baat and their participation in sports because they have made the country proud by winning medals at the Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have almost reflected this kind of thinking.
It will not be acknowledged that we have not performed according to our hopes.
In some events, our sportspersons did not reach the same level and got only two medals in the medal list.
But it is also true that despite not getting medals, the sportspersons of India have performed well for the first time in many sports.
Something like this happened in Tenniser with the combination of Shania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
There are many sportspersons like Aditi Ashoka, Turkulinal, Atanu Das, whose performance was good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
If we do what we have done, perhaps we will have to be desolate again.

My dear countrymen, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister but I am a man like you.

Those people who are trying to create peace in Kashmir by pushing these small children forward, they will have to be responsible for these young children sometimes.

I cannot mention all the states but they are congratulations.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa.
