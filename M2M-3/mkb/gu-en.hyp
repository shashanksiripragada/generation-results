Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Diwali.
My best wishes to you all on Diwali.
In this volume, light brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destructs the opposite wisdom and gives a philosophy of perfection.
In order to remember this Divine Dayoti, I salute this Divali, what could be the best idea that we spread light, spread positiveness and pray to destroy the feelings of enemies.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community is involved in this, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens of the country and the social organisation of the country are celebrated with full jealousy.
In a way India emerges there.
Friends, Festival Tourism in the world is also one of its attractions.
There is also immense possibilities of festival tourism in the festivals of our country.
It should be our endeavour to spread such festivals be it Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and include people from other states and other countries in the joys of festivals.
We have several different festivals of every state or the people of other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country in promoting festival tourism in India is also very important.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in Mann Ki Baat that this Diwali will do something different.
Let us commemorate the women's strength and achievements of India, that is, to honour the Laxmi of India.
And immediately after that, there was an unprecedented inspirational stories on social media.
It is written on the Namo App that my mother is my strength.
Since the death of my father in 10th century, my mother took up the responsibility of our five daughters.
Today we are in a good business.
My mother is God for me.
It is for me that is universal and that is indeed the Lakshmi of India.
Ramesh ji, I salute your mother.
Deepika Swami, who lives active on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushbu Kanwar is India's Laxmi, a daughter of a bus conductor.
India's Laxmi is her daughter for poem Tivari.
He is proud that his daughter performs beautiful pictures.
He has achieved a very good rank in the CLAT examination.
So Medha Jain ji has also written that an old woman of 2 years has provided free water to travellers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Medhaji has been very inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
So many stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share yourself if you have such an inspiring story around you.
I also salute all these Laxmis of India.
It seems as if its foundation was laid in the 17th century itself.
How beautiful words, how good feeling and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada language.
Paninda Permegondu Himavantanu, Paninda Bhrigu, Perchidanupendana Jankarayanu Jasavdedanu Artha, Himawant, i. e. Parvatraj, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigu Rishi, because of his daughter Laxmi and King Janaki because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride and due to the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, the 12th November, 2019 is the day when the 550th light festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nak ji is not only in India but also in the entire world.
In some countries of the world, our Sikh brothers and sisters are completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I will never be able to forget my visit to Vancover and the Gurudwaras in Tairan.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji that I can tell you. But for this, there is a lot of need of Mann Ki Baat.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji delivered his message to far-flung areas of the world.
He was one of the most travellers in his time.
They went to many places and wherever they went, they won their hearts with ease, humility and simpleness.
With the message of harmony and equality, they visited the north, south, east, west, everywhere, people met saints and sages.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
A sacred place in Kashi is Gurubagh Gurudwara .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had stayed there.
He also visited religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During the visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji himself had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place of Gurunanak Jira Saheb in Bidar, which also reminds us of Gurunanak Devji.
During a grief, Guru Nanak Dev ji also visited Kashmir and its surrounding areas in the north.
This led to a good relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also visited Tibet where people considered him a Guru.
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had travelled.
He took place in the hearts of lakhs of people who have followed and performed their teachings with full devotion.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of about 85 countries went to Amritsar from Delhi.
He visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and all this became a celebration of the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Devji.
Thereafter, many diplomats had photographed on social media and described their best experiences with great pride.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that you will certainly remember the day of October 31.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, who was the great hero of unity in the form of unity.
While Sardar Patel had a wonderful potential to connect people together, on the other hand, he used to synergize with those who had a ideological distinction.
He was the Man of Details in true sense.
He was also an expert in organisation skills.
He was welcomed in formulation and strategies.
Whenever we read about Sardar Saheb's style of work, we hear it, we find out how strong the event was organised.
Thousands of delegates from across the country were scheduled to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 121.
He also used the opportunity to improve the network of water supply in the city.
And ensured that nobody had problems with water.
Not only this, he also took care of the fact that the goods or footprints of any representative should not be stolen at the session and you would be very frustrated by knowing what Sardar Patel did.
He contacted the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
On the other hand, there was a good increase in fertilizer sales.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Patel has done a very big work and historic work to unite the Razwadas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai had a special feature, whose eyes were on every event.
On one hand, his focus was on Hyderabad, Junagarh and other states.
On the other hand, his attention was on the remote Lakshadweep.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in certain regions is also discussed in the unity of the country.
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbours looked at Lakshadweep and sent a ship with their flag.
It was known like Sardar Patel that he immediately started a tough action without delaying the time.
After his order, the triangles were waved immediately and every neighbour of Lakshadweep was destroyed in view.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the Mudaliyar brothers that they should personally ensure that there is necessary help for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
It is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that you all will also visit these beautiful islands and seashores.
My dear countrymen, the day of October 31, 2018 that the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Sahib was dedicated to the nation and the world.
This is the highest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty located in America is double the height.
The world's highest statue fills every Indian with pride.
The head of every Indian gets higher than glory.
You will be happy to know that more than 26 lakh tourists had visited the Statue of Unity in a year.
This means that everyday an average of eight and a half thousand people visited the grandeur of the Statue of Unity.
Friends, For the country and for all the states, this Statue of Unity can be a subject of study for the tourism industry.
We all are witnesses to how a place develops within a year as a world famous tourist destination.
People from across the country come there.
Transportation, accommodation, guides, environment friendly facilities are developing on one hand.
The big economy is growing and people are creating facilities as per the needs of tourists.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, Some Indians who are not proud of the fact that in the past, Time Magazine has also given importance to the Statue of Unity in 100 important tourist places of the world.
I hope that all of you will also go to see the Statue of Unity after extracting some time from your precious times.
This is my request as much as possible.
Friends, You know that every year from 2014, National Unity Day is celebrated on 31st October.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country.
Like every time, Ekta Run for Unity is being organized on 31st October.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Even today, if you want, people are seeing a joy and joy for Marathon.
Run for Unity has also been a unique role.
Running is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
There is a feeling of Feat India that runs here.
And at the same time, we are connected with the objective of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but also the mind and culture connects India to new heights for the unity of India.
And that is why whatever city you live in, you can connect with yourself with Run for Unity.
I hope that you all will run on 31st October, for the unity of India and for your fitness.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country with the trunk of unity.
This mantra of unity has become like a culture in our lives and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage on every turn at every level.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us then there will be many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony.
However, many times it becomes such that the efforts of the society will soon disappear from the memorial.
Friends, I remember that when the Allahabad High Court in September, 2010 had heard his address about Ramjanmabhoomi.
Just remember those days when there was an atmosphere.
The groups with their own interests were playing a sports game to take advantage of this situation.
What kind of language was being spoken to create heat in the environment.
In different voices, efforts were also being made to fill the glass.
Efforts were made to reduce tiredness from the environment.
We should always remember that it gives us a lot of strength.
That day, that moment is a duty to all of us.
This is an example of how great the voice of unity can give to the country.
Today, I also pay homage to them.
But it is also a pleasant and interesting experience.
I have heard these things so I think I hear you too.
You imagine that the world's highest battlefield or where the temperature goes from zero to 50-60 degrees mines.
Oxygen is also the only name in the air.
Staying among such challenges in such a opposite situation is no less than any paramount.
In such a difficult situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country but they are also running a clean syachin campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to burn money too.
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is an important task in itself.
We all know that Siachen is a snow laden region which is the source of rivers and clean water.
Hence, it means to determine the clean water for the people living in the distressed areas, these people also use the water of rivers like Nubra and Shoke.
My dear countrymen, festivals are a festival to create a new consciousness in our lives.
And especially in Deepawali there is a need to buy something or the other, to bring something from the market and to every family at least.
I had once said that we should try to buy local things.
There is no need to go to Taluka if we get things from our villages.
There is no need to go to the district if it is available in the taluka.
We will try to buy more local things.
Gandhi Saddha Shatabdi will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I have been urging that we should buy something or the other made by our Khadi workers in the hands of our dear brothers and sisters.
This Diwali too would have bought a lot of money before Diwali.
However, there will be many people who would have thought that if we go after Diwali then perhaps we will get a little cheaper.
There will be a lot of people who will still be buying.
With the best wishes of Diwali, I will urge you to come forward to buy local goods and buy local things.
You see, how important can we play in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on the auspicious occasion of Diwali.
We blossom a variety of cracks in Diwali.
But sometimes there is fire in unconsciousness.
Some injury also occurs.
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and also celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Fortunately, there will be an Indian who is not proud of our armed forces and our soldiers.
Every Indian, whether it is a region, caste, religion, creed or language - is always ready to express his happiness and support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the Surgical Strike that took place in 2016, when our soldiers responded to those who despised the proxy war under the guise of terrorism on our nation.
Our armed forces organized exhibitions at different places in the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can know what our strength is, how much we are capable and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by keeping their lives in danger.
The day like Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the pride of our Armed Forces.
And inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Now it has been decided that our soldiers will respond to all those who will try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and well-being in our nation.
We believe in peace and are committed to encouraging it, but by compromising with respect and also at the cost of sovereignty of the nation.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
In the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed their supreme sacrifice for peace in the two world wars and when we had no connection with that war.
Our eyes were never on any other land.
It was our commitment to peace.
Just a few days ago, on 23rd September, we recalled our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur lensers who freed Haifa from the invaders.
It was also a pioneer by our soldiers in the direction of peace.
Even today, India is one of the most soldiers sent to different UN Peacekeepers.
Our brave soldiers have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
During the Republic Day celebrations, the part of the parade is one of the most eagerly awaiting people, the fly past in which our Air Force displays its strength with strange carnas.
On October 8, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1932, our Air Force has joined the most adventurous and powerful Air Force of the 21st century, with 6 pilots and 17 Air Forces.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all Air Warriors and their families who have served the country.
In 1947, when Pakistan's attackers started an unprecedented attack, it was the Air Force that ensured that Indian soldiers and equipment reach the battlefield on time to protect Srinagar from the attackers.
The Air Force also responded to the enemies in 1965.
Who does not know the freedom struggle of Bangladesh in 1917
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil in 1977.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force dustbinated them by bombing the enemies at night.
Whether it is relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful to them for the commendable work of our air warriors.
Their morale has been amazing to combat natural calamities from storms, storms, floods to forest fires and help the countrymen.
The Air Force has set an example in ensuring the equality of gender quality in the country and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now the Air Force is also giving an alternative to the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that in the armed forces of India, not only men's strength but also women's strength is making similar contributions.
The women are not only empowered but now they are becoming armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, Abhilash Tommy, an officer of our Navy, was fighting for his life and death.
The whole country was thinking about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilash Tommy is a very brave officer.
He was the first Indian to travel around the world with a small boat without any modern technology alone.
For the past 80 days, he was moving forward with his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible maritime storms caused them difficulty but the heroes of the Indian Navy continued to swim between the sea for several days.
I had met Tommy before.
Even after coming out of such a calamity, his courage was strong and once again the pledge to do something like this was inspiring for the younger generation of the country.
I pray for the best health of Abhisha Tommy and their courage, their valour, their determination, commitment and victory will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, every child also knows what is important for our nation on 2nd October.
This year is a special significance of 2nd October.
For two years from today, we are going to have several programmes around the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Be it Martin Luther King Junior or great personalities like Nelson Mandela, everybody got strength from Gandhiji's ideas and fought a long battle to give equality and respect to his people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important work of revered Bapu with you, which more and more countrymen should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle gained momentum, he prepared a revised copy of these ideas.
Revered Bapu has put his thoughts in front of the countrymen on several topics such as the protection of farmers, villages, the rights of workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a folk collector.
It was the specialty of Bapu to connect with the people and connect them with them.
Everyone has experienced this as the most unique feature of his personality.
He made every person feel that it is the most important and eternal need for the country.
His biggest contribution to the freedom struggle was that he made it a mass movement.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom movement, every section of the society and every section of the society dedicated themselves.
Bapu gave us an inspirational mantra which is often known as Gandhiji's Talisman.
In this, Gandhiji said, "I give you a reply, whenever you suspect that if you start roaming around here, remember the face of the poorest and the weakest person you have seen and ask your heart how useful the steps you are thinking will be taken for the man.
Will it benefit from this
Can they do something on their own life and luck
Is it possible that crores of people who are hungry and the soul is satisfied
Then you will see that your doubts are curing and ending here.
My dear countrymen, a people of Gandhiji are equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class of the country, its growing economic power, the growing purchasing power, can we remember the revered Bapu for a moment
Can you remember that folk of revered Bapu
What will be the lucky ones who will benefit from your shopping directly or indifferently
And if the poorest of the poor benefits then my happiness will be greater.
In the coming days, whenever we buy something and celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, we must imagine that there should be a need of a countryman from every purchase and those who have sweated their sweat, who have dedicated their talent, all those who have dedicated their talent should benefit from some or the other.
This is the mantra of Gandhi, this is the message of Gandhi and I am sure that the poorest and the weakest person can bring a very big result in his life.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji had said that if you do cleanliness then you will get freedom then they might not know how it will happen - but it happened, India got freedom.
Similarly, today we can feel that even with this small work of my country, in the economic empowerment of my country, in the economic empowerment of the poor, I can have a huge contribution in fighting poverty and I believe that this is the true patriotism of today's era.
For example, if you think of buying Khadi and handloom products on special occasions, it will help many weavers.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastriji used to keep the old or cracked clothes of Khadi because somebody's hard work is hidden in it.
He said that all these Khadi clothes are manufactured with a lot of hard work.
This feeling of affection with the country and love for the countrymen was residing in the juncture of that great man.
Two days later, along with revered Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji comes, we feel immense faith in the minds of the Indians.
His generous personality always fills every countrymen with pride.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was that he was very humble from outside but he was firmly determined like a mountain from inside.
His source of 'Jawan Jai Kisan' is a symbol of his unique personality.
It was the result of his selfless penance towards the nation that during his brief tenure of one and a half years, he gave the mantras to bring the country's soldiers and farmers to the peak of success.
My dear countrymen, today, when we are remembering Poojaya Bapu, it is very natural that we cannot live without talking about cleanliness.
A campaign called Swachhta Hi Seva started from 15th September.
Millions of people joined this campaign and I was also fortunate to donate Swachhta Shram with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation was laid by Babasaheb himself.
People from all sections of the country joined this labour on 15th.
Institutions also contributed to Rangechang in it.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSSs, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate World, all of them donated Swachhta Shram on a large scale.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these Swachhta lovers.
Let's hear a phone call-namaskar
You have said a big thing that cleanliness has its own importance in everybody's life and under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, toilets have been built in your houses and you are now facilitating it.
And perhaps the people associated with this campaign will not be able to imagine that you cannot see because of being an expert but when there was no toilet then you might have lost your life with so many problems and how big a boon has been made for you after being a toilet.
Perhaps if you did not even call for connecting this aspect then perhaps this sensitivity would not have come in the attention of the people associated with this campaign of cleanliness.
I specially thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful story not only in the country but also in the whole world.
This time, India is organizing the worlds largest Swachhta Sammelan in history.
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, which means Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, is interacting with the sanitation ministers and experts from all over the world.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude on October 2, 2018 with the launch of the 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Bapu.
It is particularly essential to ensure the freedom, peace and justice of the exploited, the victims and the deprived.
Dr.
Several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor in the Constitution by Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was formed on 12th October, 1947.
After a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also worked to increase human dignity.
Our favourite leader, former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, had clearly stated that human rights are not a passionate concept for us.
The symbolic symbol of our National Human Rights Commission contains the ideal formula of the Vedic period.
NHRC has created comprehensive awareness for human rights as well as has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
During this 25-year visit, he has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the countrymen.
For a healthy society, for the best democratic values, I understand that this is a very hopeful event.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand and behave the importance of human rights - that is the basis of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, be it the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan, Rajmata Vijayaraj, the birth centenary year of Sindhia ji - all these great men have been inspiring us and we bow down to them and on 31st October the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, I will talk in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat but today I want to mention that for a few years, on 31st October the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the Run for Unity is organised in every small town, town, town and town.
This year too, in our villages, in towns, in towns and in metropolitan cities, we should organize the 'Run for Unity'.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to build every section of the society and every unit of the country in the formula of unity through the 'Run for Unity' on 31st October and that will be a good tribute to them.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, today the whole country is celebrating the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
For centuries, this festival has also been an example of social harmony.
There are many stories in the history of the country in which one person had linked two different states or people associated with religion with faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is also coming.
The entire atmosphere will rise from the jewellery of elephants, horses, palanquins.
The simple joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is different.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Sanskrit Week.
I am extremely grateful to daughter Chinmayi who raised this topic.
Friends, Besides Raksha Bandhan, Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravani Purnima.
I congratulate all those who have been taking this great legacy to protect, nurture and reach the same people.
Every language has its own greatness.
India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world.
And all of us are proud of the fact that from the Vedas to the present, Sanskrit language has also played a very important role in the spread of knowledge.
The store of knowledge associated with every field of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka State still use Sanskrit language for interaction.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which infinite words are possible.
It is possible to create innumerable words through 2000 metals, 200 i.e. Sufix, 22 parsug i.e. prefix and solutions.
And that is why a subtle price or subject can be surely expressed in any subtle manner.
That is, if a Guru gives knowledge of a letter to his disciple, then there is no such thing or wealth in the entire earth that the disciple can take off the loan of his Guru.
Let us all celebrate the Teacher's Day in this sense. Knowledge and Guru are invaluable and invaluable.
I convey my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
With this, I thank you for your dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, this month brings new hopes for our farmers who work hard.
Monsoon relief is provided to dry trees and dry reservoirs in strong sunlight.
But sometimes it also brings rain and devastating floods.
There has been a situation of nature that in some places more rains have occurred than other places.
All of us have just seen that Kerala has had a lot of impact on the terrible life.
Today, in this difficult situation, the entire country stands with Kerala.
Our condolences are with those families.
I am confident that Kerala will meet again very soon with the courage and indomitable courage of the people of the state.
However, we also see humanity during disasters.
Whenever there is a disaster, whether it is Kerala or any other district of India or region, it is doing something or the other place from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to normalize the lives of the people.
All the adults and people associated with every workforce are contributing to them.
We all know that the armed forces are dry in the rescue operations in Kerala.
He left no stone unturned to save the flooded people.
Whether it is Air Force, Navy, Land Force or BSF, CISF, RF, everyone has played a very big role in rescue and relief operations.
I would also like to specifically mention the hard work of the brave soldiers of NDRF.
The topic that people from all over the country have written is the beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Pravin from Kerala, Dr.
Several innumerable people have written on the Narendra Modi mobile app and on MyGov and have urged me to talk about different aspects of Atal ji's life.
On the 16th August, the country and the world heard the news of the demise of Atal ji and everybody was sorry.
Leaders of the nation who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, for the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
The kind of affection, devotion and grief that has emerged all over the country shows his huge personality.
For the past few days, Atal ji's best aspects have come forward to the country.
India will always be the credit of Atal ji for the 19th Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two major changes in India's politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the Full Legislative Assembly meetings.
Secondly, the limit set under the Prevention of Parties Act was increased from one-third to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines were also set to make the participants disqualified along with them.
For many years, the political culture of making big cabinets in India was built for sharing of work, not for sharing of work, but for making politicians happy.
Atal ji changed this culture.
These steps saved money and resources.
It also enhanced efficiency.
Atal ji was such a vision that changed the situation and the healthy tradition of our political culture came into force.
Atal ji was a true patriot.
In 2017, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5:00 in the evening to 11:00 in the morning.
In this way, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the people.
I will certainly say that for a healthy democracy, for better democracy, for better traditions, for strengthening democracy, for sustainable efforts, for open deliberations, it will also be considered an excellent tribute to Atal ji.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament was completed just a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and was 4 of the Rajya Sabha.
And as a result, the Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills and the Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills in this session.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and the welfare of the youth.
Several important bills have been passed in this session, which benefit the youth and backward classes.
You all know that for decades, there was a demand for setting up the OBC Commission like Scheduled Castes- Tribes.
To ensure the rights of Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the resolve to form an OBC Commission this time.
The session also passes the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes better.
Together, it will prevent the offenders from atrocities against the people of this class and irrigate faith in the Dalit communities.
No member society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women power of the country.
Therefore, by passing the Customs Law Amendment Bill, the Parliament has provided strict punishment to such criminals and the culprits of the crimes will be punished for at least 10 years.
When children under 12 years of age will be sentenced to death.
A few days ago, it may have been read in the newspapers that a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh has to complete the sleep in just two months and punish two offenders of crime on one side.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had punished the culprits only after a five-day hearing.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have paid such a rapid payment.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing crime against women and children.
Economic progress is incomplete without social change.
This time in the fourth session, everyone has presented an ideal in collaboration with everyone.
Today I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, the attention of the present millions of countrymen is attached to the Asian Games played in Jakarta.
Every morning, people get up and look at the first in the newspapers, TV, news, social media and see that any Indian player has won medals.
Asian sports are still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to those sportspersons who are still left.
India's sportspersons, especially in marking and wrestling, are showing medals in such sports as well as our sportspersons, in which our sportspersons have not been so good before, such as Vushu and Naval Sports.
This is not just medals, but also the Puranas of Indian sports and sportspersons.
Our daughters are among the growing medal winners for the country. This is a very positive sign.
Similarly, among the young sportspersons who have won medals, we are also young in the age of 15-16.
It is also a very good sign that most of the sportspersons who have won medals are living in small towns and villages and these sportspersons have achieved this success through hard work.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and also pay my homage to Shri Dhyanchand Ji, the magician of Hockey.
I urge all the citizens of the country to play sports and take care of their stiffness as a healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
If India is healthy then it will create a bright future of India.
Namaste Bhavna ji, I respect your feelings.
We all have seen buildings and houses of brick stones, but can you imagine that about 1200 years ago, a huge mountain which was a complete rock had been given the form of an excellent large and wonderful temple, perhaps it is difficult to imagine, but it was like that.
And that temple is the Kailasnath temple located in Ellora, Maharashtra. If someone tells you that a pillar of granite was built over 60 metres a thousand years ago and a pillar of approximately 80 tonnes of granite was laid on its peak.
But the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is such a place where this unbelievable mix of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Harkoi is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patna, Gujarat.
India's Bhumi engineering laboratory has been a laboratory.
There were many engineers in India who imagined the imagination and presented miracles in the world of engineering.
In our heritage of great engineers, we also got a gem whose work is still surprised by the people.
M.
He is not only worshipped in that part of the country but the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and dignity.
In his memory, 15th September is celebrated as Engineers Day.
On his footsteps, the engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world.
Whenever I talk of miracles in the world of engineering, I remember an incident of the terrible earthquake that had occurred in Kutch in Gujarat in 2001.
So I got the opportunity to visit a village and I got the opportunity to meet a majesty over 100 years of age.
They were enjoying me and saying that this is my house.
In Kutch it is called Bhungo.
My house later saw 3-3 earthquakes.
But you can't see any harm.
This house was built by our ancestors in accordance with the natural situation here.
And he was saying so proudly that I thought that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had created according to the local situation, which led to the safeguard of the common man.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at different places.
Do we have to learn some new things in the changing age
Do you have to learn
Do you have to connect
What should be taught to the students
How should ero Waste be our priority
Whenever we celebrate Engineers Day, we must think of many such things.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of festivals.
And with this, preparations for Diwali also start.
My best wishes to everyone with such a feeling.
Thank you, I'll meet you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
However, at some places people are still waiting for rains.
The vastness and diversity of India sometimes shows the form of favourite rainfall.
But what do we blame the rain
Man who chose the path of struggle with nature and consequently, sometimes Nature is embarrassed on us.
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day Kishmat had some other approval.
When he walked inside the cave, due to sudden heavy rains, a good water was collected near the entrance of the cave.
The way out of them was closed.
Due to lack of roads, all of them stayed on a small rock inside the cave.
And that's not a day or two, for 18 days.
On one hand, he was facing a crisis.
On the other hand, humanity in the entire world was showcasing the human qualities that God has preserved.
People from all over the world were praying for the safety of these children.
The experience of responsibilities at every level was amazing.
Whether it is the government or the parents of these children, their family members, the media or the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
All of them were associated with their campaign by forming a team.
I believe that everybody's comprehensive behavior is a matter of learning and understanding.
It is not that the parents are not sad, it is not that the eyes of the mothers are not blind, but the peaceful consciousness of the entire society is like learning for all of us.
This shows that when humanity becomes a serpent, wonderful things are made.
A few days ago, the beloved poet of our country, Neeraj ji, took a separation from us.
Everything of Neeraj ji can give us great strength and inspiration to the Indians.
Your show is now a message for students like me.
However, two months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when the college has a very busy time.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam come out of school and enter the college.
If Feb and March go to exams, papers and answers, the results are spent in the holidays of April and May as well as in determining the path ahead in life, selecting the job.
The attention of the students is reduced from home to school.
Students come to the umbrella of professors from their parents.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, one has to leave the house, leave the village and get out of a safe environment and make oneself a friend.
All such youngsters have to leave their homes for the first time and drive their lives into a new direction.
I will tell you all that be calm, be calm, believe in life and enjoy your intuition in life.
Learn something new, like new skills, new languages.
He has already achieved success in the MBBS examination of Jodhpur AIIMS.
Their father supplements the garbage and nurtures his family.
I congratulate them for their success.
There are many students who come from the poor families and despite the opposite consolidation, they have shown their hard work and inspiration to all of us.
Be it the Prince of Delhi, whose father is a bus driver in DTC, or Abhay Gupta of Kolkata, who studied on the footpath under the street line, be it the daughter of Ahmedabad, the African Shekha or whose father runs the autorickshaw.
Or, the Divyang daughter of Gurgaon, Anushka Panda, who is suffering from a hereditary disease called spinal cord, spine muscular atrophy since birth.
All of them have achieved such success by removing every obstacle from their determination and courage to see the whole world.
If we look around us, we will also find some such examples.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
And when I am telling you the story of this young man, I remember the story of poet Neeraj Ji and this is the goal of life.
There was something like this. Once I was discussing with two Indian youth in San Jose town in America, known as the hub of technology.
I appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and do something after extracting time.
He appealed to Brain Drine to convert him into a brainguine.
Both the IT professionals of Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, have made an innovative effort to overcome this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajnish ji have prepared a smart village app together using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the entire world but now they believe that they can get information on their mobile phones.
The residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, Sarpanch, District Magistrate, Technical Development Officer, all made people aware about the use of this app.
Now it has become easier to keep an eye on the progress of the development works that are being done in the village to record it through this app.
The App consists of Village Phone Directory, Department of Communications, List of Programmes, Health Centres and Mahiti Centres.
The Grameen Feature of the App, Fact Rate between the farmers, in a way, works like a market for their products.
If you look closely at this event, one thing will be noticed that those who have lived in the United States in the midst of the life of the people of America and the thoughts that had left India several years ago, those youngsters also know the finest of their villages, understand the challenges and are associated with the emotions of the villages.
This is the reason why perhaps they could make the villages better and they could make them better according to them.
This feeling of connectivity with our villages and their roots and the feeling of doing something for the welfare of our country is naturally within every Indian.
But sometimes because of some distance due to time, sometimes due to circumstances, a thin dust accumulates on them. But if a small humility touches them then good things come up again.
Pandarpur Vari is indeed a unique journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Academy, which was on 23rd July this time, is celebrated as a grand circumambulation of Pandarpur Vari.
Pandarpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
About 15-20 days before the Ashadhi Academy, Varkari i.e. pilgrims go out on foot to travel to Pandarpur along with Palki.
This journey, which is called Vari, is linked to lakhs of workers.
Vithal Vithal, holding the audience of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram in Palakhi.
Tirthankaras are Lord Vithal who are also called Vithoba or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived and the suffering.
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
To see the Vitoba temple in Pandarpur and the month there is a different experience of beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandarpur Vari once they get the opportunity.
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still educating the human beings in Maharashtra.
They are giving strength to fight against blindness.
We get the message of harmony, love and brotherhood from them whether it is strong or indiscriminate.
There is a mantra of society to fight against blindness.
These were those people who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokyo and ariso and ensured that old evils should be abolished from our society and irrigated the culture of compassion, equality and cleanliness among the people.
We commemorate Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and intellectuality of the British rulers to show their mistakes.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he blamed him for imposing royalties three times in 20 years and this is not a small thing.
Today, I would like to present an interesting event related to Lokmanya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
In October 16, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, more than 40 thousand people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad, perhaps 100 years ago.
During this visit, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with him.
And Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was so impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak died on 1st August, 1920, he decided that he would build a memorial of Tilak ji in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 12th.
And I have been listening to that time of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak Ji, the tradition of public Ganesh Festival started.
The public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of pursuing the spirit of social awareness, communityity, equality and equality among the people along with traditional devotion and fervor.
Well, it was a time when the country had a serpent for the fight against the British, these festivals broke the dragons of caste and sect and worked to unite everyone.
Over time, the popularity of these events has increased.
This only shows how this is a craze in our youth for our ancient heritage and our brave leaders of history.
Today, in many cities, you can see Ganesh Mandap in almost every street.
My dear countrymen, during the last May too, and today, when I am reminding Lokmanya Tilak Ji, I will once again request you to celebrate the Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate the Ganesh festival with humility, celebrate it with full force, but keep an insistence on celebrating the eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
And I will even say that the items of Eco Friendly Ganesh Festival should be put up on May Gov and on the Narendra Modi App for comprehensive publicity.
I will deliver your words to certain people.
Lokmanya Tilak raised confidence in the people of the country and gave an insistence that Swaraj is our right to be born and we will be able to do it even today.
That is, Swaraj is our right to be born and we will be able to take it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development.
Those who sacrificed their lives so that the countrymen could breathe in the air of freedom.
Chandrashekhar inspired many youngsters for the bravery and freedom of freedom.
Freedom kept his life on the boot but he never bowed in front of foreign rule.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Alirajpur village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I bow down to these two great sons of Mother India Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship held in Finland, India's brave daughter and Kisanputri Hima Das won the gold medal.
In response to my letter, I have e-mailed to Indonesia that it is still preparing Asian Games there.
The name of the country has been Roshan.
Unity has won gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prie 2018 in Tunisia.
His achievement is special because he has made his challenge a medium of action.
Due to road accident in 2003, half of the lower part of the body of the daughter Ekta Bhayan has become unemployed, but this daughter has achieved this achievement by not losing courage and strengthening itself.
One more Divyang Yogesh Kathunia ji has also won the Gold in Berlin at Para Athletics Grand Prima Discuss Thro (Chakrafank), and along with Sunder Singh Gurjer has also won the Gold in Bhalafank.
My dear countrymen, many incidents of the history of August and festivals are filled with a lot but sometimes due to monsoon, diseases also enter the house.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the best health, for the months of August and for several festivals that have been running for centuries.
Once again, I will definitely get Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Just a few days ago, a historic cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You must have understood a lot that I am talking about the test match of India and Afghanistan.
He was the first international match in Afghanistan and it is a matter of pride for Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two teams performed a very good performance in this match and other ballers of Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, had performed a lot in the IPL this year and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Shriman Ashraf Ghani, had tagged me and wrote on his Twitter, the people of Afghanistan are very proud of his diamond Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan.
This is the world's asset and he also wrote in a funny manner that we should give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable match for all of us.
This was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember that match for some special reason.
The Indian team has done something that is an example for the entire world.
He said what a winner team can do while taking the Indian team trophy.
While taking the Indian team trophy, the Afghan team, which was playing the first international match, invited the Afghan team and photographed the two teams.
What happens to sportsman spirit, what happens to sportsmanship - we can experience this incident.
It is a very good solution to unite sports society and to find the talent in our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will play with each other as well as with full sportsman spirit as well.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked together.
Be it the Europian Parliament in Brussels, the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, the Japanese Navy fighter ships, people were seen doing Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga took place and I was told that women had demonstrated many asanas.
On the high Berfila peaks of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China together practiced yoga.
Yoga works to break and connect all boundaries.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went up with caste, religion, region, color or sex and made this occasion a big festival.
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes so enthusiastically, why should not it be counted in India
The country is proud when 125 crore people see that the security forces of our country have practiced Yoga at three places of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force.
Some of the brave soldiers performed Yoga in Sabarina and some soldiers practiced Yoga on the mountains of snow in Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force have embarrassed everyone in the middle of the sky, at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth.
The sight of seeing was that he did not sit in the plane but did Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports fields, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
One scene of Ahmedabad was touching the heart.
About 50 Divyang brothers and sisters have established world wrath by practicing Yoga together at one place.
I believe that today Yoga is working as a wellness and revolution.
I hope that the movement of wellness from Yoga will move forward.
Maximum people will make it part of their lives.
Many people have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App that I should talk about 'Doctors Day' in Mann Ki Baat on 1st July this time.
We recall the doctors at the time of difficulty, but this is a day when the country celebrates the achievements of our doctors and thanks them for their service and dedication to the society.
We are those people who are self-devoted to worship Mother as God and believe in God because mother gives us life.
Mother gives birth to us and sometimes doctors give us birth again.
The role of the doctor is not limited to the treatment of diseases.
Today doctors do not have medical expertise but they have a lot of experience about the impact of the general lifestyle trends on our health.
Indian doctors have made their identity all over the world with their capabilities and skills.
In the medical profession, along with Maharath, hardworking, our doctors are also known for addressing the complex medical problems.
With the help of Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on behalf of every countrymen on the occasion of 'Doctors Day' coming on July 1st.
My dear countrymen, we are lucky people who have been born in this land of India.
India has been a prosperous history when there is no such month, there is no such day in which there is no historic event.
Look, every place in India has its own heritage.
There is a saint, a great man, a famous person, everybody has his own contribution, his own greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th and even when I was in Gujarat, you will be aware of the Kabirvad of Gujarat.
When I was working there, I had done a very big national session of the people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You people know why Kabirdas ji had come to Maghar
At that time there was a concept that those who died in Magahar would not go to heaven.
And the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven.
Magahar was considered inadequate but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in it.
He worked to break the same evils and superstitions of his time, so he went to Maghar and took a samadhi there.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his witnesses and dohas.
He was his ideal.
We see the same ideals in their creations and inspire them in today's era.
He has a couple: Kabir Soi Peer Hai, if Peer Janhi on Jane, So Ka Peer Me Peer Me Peerte means that the true Peer Saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of the other, who does not know the pain of the other.
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking far ahead of his time.
At that time when the time of conflict was going on in the world, he conveyed a message of peace and harmony and worked together to remove the differences between the people.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he went, he took several initiatives for the welfare of the society.
The system of kitchen free from social discrimination where people of every caste, sect, religion or sect can come and eat food and Guru Nanak Dev had started this langar system.
In 2019, the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated.
I want all of us to join them with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I also urge you people to think about what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what should be, what should be prepared, and with great pride, let us all make this light festival an inspiration festival.
India's freedom struggle is very long, is very wide, is very old, is full of innumerable martyrs.
There is a history associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the horrific incident of Jallianwala Bagh is also completing 100 years, which has embarrassed humanity.
Who can forget the black day of April 13, 1911 when pills were run on innocent, unarmed and unarmed people by crossing all limits of cruelty using power.
The victory always takes place in peace and non-violence, sacrifices and sacrifices.
Raman Kumar, Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr.
Shyamaprasad is the birthday of Mukherjee and he wants Dr.
Talk to the countrymen about Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
Raman ji, first of all thank you very much.
I looked very good to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was associated with several areas but the areas which were closest to him were education, administrations and parliament offices.
Very few people would know that Kolkata was the youngest Vice Chancellor of the University.
On the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bangladesh.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industry Minister of India and in one sense, he laid the foundation stone for India and industrial development, built a strong base, built a strong platform.
The first Industrial Policy of the Freedom India in 1948 brought a mark of his ideas and vision.
Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as focus on MSMEs, handicrafts, textiles and cottage industries.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board, Khadi Village Industries Board was established between 1948 and 150 for getting financial and organisation setups for better development of cottage and small industries.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Their understanding, intellect and activism is the result of a part of Bengal to be saved and it is a part of India today.
Dr.
Remembering the message of unity of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, let us continue to be associated with the spirit of harmony and brotherhood for Indias progress.
My dear countrymen, in the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
I got the opportunity to learn from them directly about the changes in the lives of people ahead of the files.
People spoke of their resolve, their happiness and misery, their achievements.
In far-flung villages, girls are providing services from pension to passports through Common Service Centre.
When a sister of Chhattisgarh gathers and makes an ice cream to do business.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youth of the country are running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing affordable medicines to the nearby villages.
There should be no corner of the country where people have not spoken about their success.
In such a situation, when the common man brings about new hopes, new zeal and incidents in his life, it is not the credit of the government.
The incident of a small girl from far-flung villages also becomes an inspiration for 125 crore people.
With the help of technology for me, a moment to spend time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant and inspiring and it not only provides satisfaction to work but also provides enthusiasm to work more.
There is a new joy of giving life to the poorest of the poor, a new zeal and a new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people joined the video bridge programme and you have done the work of giving me a new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then somewhere or the other is better.
There are people who do good.
We can also experience the aroma of goodness.
In the last few days, one thing came to my mind and it was a unique combination.
On one hand, where there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
Now you will imagine that these two are very different businesses - what is the relationship with this
However, it is like that corporate professionals and IT engineers have come together in Bengaluru and they have made a simple prosperity trust and have activated this trust for doubling the income of farmers.
Connecting the farmers and making plans and making successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Today, they are not only growing vegetables but also marketing their vegetables through the Trust.
The farmers producing grains are also associated with it.
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand farmers' participation in profits is ensuring and ensuring their right.
I am extremely grateful to these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology and engineering have adopted the path of connecting the farmers and connecting them with the villages.
Once again, I might have knew these innovative experiments of the younger generation of my country, I might have knew something, some would have knew it, some would have knew it.
GST is about to complete one year.
One nation, one tax was the dream of the people of the country, it has turned into reality today.
For one nation, one tax reform, if I have to credit anyone, then I will give credit to the states.
GST is a good example of cooperative federalism, where all the states together took decisions in the country and when such a big tax reform was implemented in the country.
So far, two meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proudly proud that people of different political ideas sit there, people from different states sit there, there are different states with propriety but in addition to this, the number of decisions taken in the GST Council has been taken with all consent.
Prior to GST, there were seven different types of taxes in the country but now only one tax is being implemented in the country.
GST is a victory of honesty and is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier in the country, there were complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of taxes.
With the arrival of GST, check posts have been closed and the movement of goods and goods has accelerated, which has not only saved time but also benefitted in the Logistics sector.
Perhaps GST will be the largest tax reform in the world.
Such a big tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and the success of GST could be ensured through Jan Shakti.
Normally it is believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population, it takes 5-5 years to fully stabilize it but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the festival of honesty is the result of the Jan Shakti Partnership that within a year, this new tax system has made its place, has achieved stability and it continues to improve its inbuilt system as per the requirement.
This is a huge success in itself by 1. 25 billion Indians.
Once again, after completing Mann Ki Baat, I am waiting for the next Mann Ki Baat to meet you and talk to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar
I have got the opportunity to be present before you once again through Mann Ki Baat.
You will be well aware of the fact that a group of six women commanders of the Navy had been on a sea journey for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama Ji, I would like to talk about it.
These six daughters of India, their team travelled through the sea for more than a few days and returned to India on 21st May and the whole country welcomed them very warmly.
He cut a distance of about twenty thousand nautical miles while traveling in different oceans and many seas.
This was the first such incident in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these girls and listen to their experiences.
If we want the development journey of human race then progress has been born from some adventure.
In the last few days, you must have seen that some new things have been noticed on Mount Everest and Everest has been fighting human race for centuries and brave people have been accepting that challenge.
On 16th May, five tribal children from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Dhurve, Premesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katamode, Vikas Soyam - a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur's school and to my young friends.
Currently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to serve Everest from Nepal.
Congratulations to Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest became the first Indian father-son to Sar.
It is not that only the youth are fighting Everest.
Sangeeta Bahel flew Everest on May 1, and Sangeeta Bahl's age is more than 50.
There are also some riding on Everest who have shown that they have not only skill but also sensitivity.
People have been fighting Everest for years and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these adventures, especially the daughters.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends. Just two months ago, when I talked about Fit India, I did not think that there would be such a good impact on it.
In such a large number, people of every sector will come forward in support of it.
When I talk about Fit India, I believe that the country will play as much as we will play.
People are sharing video of fitness challenges on social media, tagging each other in them and challenging them.
Today everybody is joining this campaign of Fit India.
Whether it is the people associated with the film, the people associated with the sports world or the common people of the country, the soldiers of the country, the teachers of the school, the same buzz is heard all around - 'Hum fit to India fit'.
It is a matter of happiness for me that I have also given the challenge by Captain Virat Kohli of the Indian Cricket Team and I have accepted the challenge.
I believe that this is a very good thing and this kind of challenge will encourage us to keep fit and to remain fit.
Chhavi Yadav Ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
It is true that the sports that used to be a part of the lives of every child was lost today.
These sports were particularly part of summer vacation.
There are two types of sports in traditional sports.
It is also outside the house and is also inside the house.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports.
The same sports is known by different names in different places.
I am from Gujarat.
I know that there is a sport in Gujarat.
They are playing with coriander seeds or pieces and with the square board of 8x8.
This game was built in almost every state.
We were also playing this game.
Who of us would have played Moi Dandia (Gilly Danda) in childhood
Moi Dandia (Gilly Danda) is a playing game from villages to cities.
It is known by different names in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla.
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Vittidalu.
Some sports had their own season.
There is also a season to chew kites.
When all the kites fly, when we play, we can express Muktaman the unique features we have.
You must have seen that many children are ruthless but they become very frustrated during sports.
They express themselves, the elders who look serious and the child who is hidden in them while playing comes out.
Traditional sports have become in such a way that along with physical capabilities, our arbitrary thinking, concentration, awareness and stimulation also increases.
From children to grandfather, little girl, when all are playing, Pela is said to be a generation gap.
Several sports also make us aware of society, environment etc.
Today, it is necessary that schools, girls, youth groups etc. come forward and promote these sports.
Through cross sourcing, we can make a huge collection of our traditional sports.
My dear countrymen, on the next 5th of June, our country will be officially hosting the World Environment Day celebrations.
This is an important achievement for India and the growing leadership of India in the world in the direction of reducing climate change is also a proof of this.
The theme of this time is Beat Plastic Pollution.
I appeal to you all to understand the spirit of this theme and its importance and ensure that we do not use polythene, law-grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on our wildlife and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website Wed-India 2018 and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - look, know and try to bring them into your daily life.
When there is severe heat, floods, rains do not take the name of stopping, unbearable cold, then every person speaks of global warming and climate change by becoming an expert but what does it work
In the last few weeks, we all have seen that in different parts of the country there was dust and heavy rains along with heavy winds.
There was also a loss of lives and losses.
All these things are basically the result of the changes in climate change.
Our culture, our traditions have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live together with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had spoken of this thing in his lifestyle.
When India played a key role in the Cop21 and the Paris Agreement, when we assisted the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, it was a feeling of fulfilling this dream of Mahatma Gandhi in all its origin.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about whether we can do something to keep our planet clean and green
How can we move forward in this direction
Can we become innovative
Monsoon is to come, we can take the goal of vibrant tree plantation this time and not only plant trees but also to maintain it till it grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends.
Now you remember 21st June, not only you, but the entire world remembers 21st June.
21 June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago.
Today, news is being reported that there is a strong preparation for 21st June to be celebrated as International Day of Yoga all over the world.
Yoga for University and Harmonius Society is a message that the world has experienced in the last few years.
By doing yoga, courage is born which protects us like a simple father.
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bharatuhari has said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our child, mercy, our sister, self-confidence, our brother, the earth itself, our bed and knowledge becomes our hungry.
When all these qualities become friends then Yogi wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge the countrymen to build a healthy, prosperous and harmonious nation ahead of our heritage of Yoga.
Today is the 2nd May, the first death anniversary of Indias first senior Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Pandit ji.
The memory of the month of May is also associated with another thing and that is Veer Savarkar.
This was the month of May 1985 when Indians showed their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were committed against their brave injustice.
The sad thing is that we have been calling the events of 185 only rebellion or rebellion for a long time.
In fact, this incident was realized as a calculation but it was also an attempt to push our sovereignty.
He was Veer Savarkar who had written intimately that whatever happened in 1985 was not a rebellion but it was the first fight for independence.
The heroes of India House in London, including Savarkar, celebrated their 50th anniversary with humor.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month as the first freedom struggle started in the month.
Savarkar ji's personality was full of characteristics
He was an admirer of both arms and sciences.
Normally, Veer Savarkar is known for his brave and fight against the British rule, but apart from this, he was also an Owner Poet and a social reformer who always stressed on harmony and unity.
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been done by our beloved respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Atal ji had made an honest picture.
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together.
He was a brave revolutionary along with being a sensitive poet.
Our daughters who were forced to buy garbage and ask for a house-to-house. Today they are learning the work of sewing and sewing clothes to cover the poor.
I extend my best wishes to our daughters full of hope and confidence for their bright future.
He has shown that if you have the courage to do something and you are committed to it, then success can be achieved among all the difficulties.
And it is not just a matter of Sikar but you will see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at yourself, you will be able to see how people defeat problems.
You must have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, we enjoy tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people present there.
These discussions are also of politics, social, cinema, sports and sportspersons, there are also problems of the country or they should be solved in such a way. But most of these things are limited to discussions only but some people are those who move forward in the direction of their hard work and transformation.
Shri D.
Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades.
Today, you will be surprised to know that more than 70 children are filling the light of education in their lives.
He opened a school called ASHASHAN for children living in the slums, which costs 50 of their income by the poor tea sellers.
It provides full education, health and food for all the children coming to the school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, his relationship and giving a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He has removed the darkness of his life.
Tamso Ma Jyotirgamayya is not aware of this Vedic corner but has shown it alive.
Prakash Rave.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and for the entire country.
You will also have a series of such inspirational events around you.
There will be countless incidents.
Let us move ahead with positiveness.
There is so much heat in the month of June that people wait for rain and in hope they look at the clouds in the sky.
After a few days, people will also wait for the moonlight.
The moonlight means that Id can be celebrated.
The festival of Id is a symbol of the beginning of the celebrations after a month's fasting during Ramzan.
I am confident that all the people will celebrate this with full enthusiasm and on this occasion, especially the children will get good meditation.
I hope that the festival of Id will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
17 countries of the world, including India, participated in this event.
When such a big event is being organised, thousands of players from all over the world are participating in it, you can imagine how the atmosphere will be
The resolve to show the passion, feelings, zeal, hopes, aspirations and something when such an atmosphere is there then who can keep it different from himself.
Our sportspersons also performed very well in the hope of the countrymen and won a medal after one.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis or badminton, India has done a record exhibition.
26 Gold, 20 Silver and 20 Bronze - India won about 66 medals.
This success makes every Indian proud.
Winning medals is a matter of pride and happiness for sportspersons.
It is a festival of great pride for the entire country and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps I have less words to express this feeling.
But I would like to hear you what I heard from these players.
Specially, this time there were many things which happened for the first time.
Do you know that this time all the wrestlers from India in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Batra won medals in all the events.
This is the first Indian woman who won India a gold medal in the Individual Table tennis.
India has got the highest medals shooting.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Indian Para Power Lifter to win a medal in Commonwealth Games.
The games of this time were also special because most of the medal winners were women athletes.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting, shooting, women sportspersons have done a lot of work.
In the Badminton, the final competitors were two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehru and P.
V.
It happened between Sindhu.
The athletes participating in the games came from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends also contribute to those who have maintained their courage in every situation.
I congratulate all those sportspersons and convey my best wishes.
Last month, during Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the countrymen, especially our youth to fit India and I had invited everyone to join the fit India and lead the fit India.
A gentleman, Shri Shashikant Bhonsle, has written in a swimming pool sharing a picture that - My weapon is my body, my health is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written, I feel myself happy and healthy with Morning walk.
And they further say that for me-fitness companies with a smile and we should smile, when we are happy.
Devnath ji has no doubt that there is a fitness of hypines.
Cine artist Akshay Kumar has put a video on Twitter.
Many other youths have shared their experiences by connecting with the Fit India Efforts.
I believe that this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
The Mahatma of 21st June International Day of Yoga has now been accepted by the entire world.
You should also prepare from now on.
And you must have seen that an animated video in which I have been shown is becoming very popular.
My young friends, you will now get out of the circumambulation of exams, exams and exams and you will now be worried about holidays.
How to celebrate holidays, where to go.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to revive and experience life away from the computer.
My young friends, I am appealing to you today for a special internship.
Be it the three Ministries of the Government of India, be it HRD, the Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched the Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The students and students of colleges, the youth of NCC, the youth of NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendras who want to do something for the society, the people who want to join themselves in the transformation of the society, the intention to do something or the other in the society with a positive energy, this is an opportunity for all and it will also strengthen the cleanliness and when we will be happy to do something before this, and I will also tell you that those who have done good interns, who have done good work in the college, who have done good work in the university will be awarded at the national level.
Every intern that successfully fulfills this internship will be given a certificate by Swachh Bharat Mission.
Not only that, the Internet will complete it very well, the UGC will also give them two credit points.
I once again invite the students, students and the youth to take advantage of it for the internship.
You can go to MyGov app and register for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youth will further pursue this movement of cleanliness.
I also want to know about your efforts.
You must send your mothers, send stories, send photographs, send video.
Let us make this holiday an opportunity to learn for a new experience.
In the last few days, I have seen that the youngsters of Delhi were talking about those who were engaged in selflessness for the education of poor children.
Beginning from 15 children in slums near Gita College in Delhi today, this campaign has been linked to 2,000 children at 12 places in the capital.
Youth and teachers associated with this campaign are engaged in this great effort of social change by removing a free time of 2 hours from their busy daily routine.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become the source of inspiration for the farmers across the country.
His organised efforts not only changed his own but also his fate.
Bageshwar in Uttarakhand mainly produces ragi, Rajgra, maize or poultry crops.
Being a hilly area, farmers cannot get the right price.
However, the farmers of Kapkot taluka have adopted the way for value addition instead of tolerating the fault of selling this crop directly in the market.
What did they do - they started making a biscuit from this fertilizer production and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have built a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have also started a factory to build a biscuit there.
Seeing the courage of the farmers, the system has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being transported not only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausaudi.
With the hard work of the farmers, the institution has reached an annual turnover of Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs but with the help of more than 100 families, those who are out of the district have also started stopping.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that there is a war with water in the world in the future.
Everyone speaks this, but do we have any responsibility or not
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
Our ancestors have shown it alive for centuries.
He has given priority to the Mahatma of one drop of water.
He has discovered such new solutions how to save one drop of water .
Perhaps those of you who have got the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, there are some temples in Tamil Nadu where irrigation system, water conservation system, drought management and its big inscriptions have been written in the temples.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will be able to see big inscriptions everywhere.
If you go to Rajasthan then definitely go to Chand Baw in Jodhpur.
It is one of India's largest and beautiful streams and the focusing point is that it is in the region where water deficiency remains.
April, May, June, July is such a time when there is a great opportunity to collect rain water and if we make preparations in the advance then we get the benefit as much.
Manrega's budget also works for water conservation.
During the last three years, everybody has made its own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
About 32 thousand crore rupees have been spent on water conservation and water management separate from Manrega Budget every year.
Talking about the year 2017-18, I have spent 55 of the total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore, i. e.
During the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted in large quantity through water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have taken advantage of the budget available by the Government of India for water conservation and water management.
Thousands of Manrega workers on the Kuttumperu river in Kerala worked hard for 70 days and revived the river.
Ganga and Yamuna are rivers filled with water but there are also some areas in Uttar Pradesh like two small rivers named Sasur Khadiri of Fatehpur district have dried up.
The district system has speeded up the work of soil and water conservation in large numbers under Manrega.
With the help of people of about 40-45 villages, this Sasur Khadiri river, which was dry, revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, how much blessed is this success.
I would like to say that once again, April, May, June, July are before us, we should also take some responsibility for water conservation.
When Mann Ki Baat is there, I get messages from all sides, papers and phones.
We celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year on MyGov. But many people do not know about the philosophy of living with the peacefulness, beauty and integrity of the Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore.
Discuss this topic in Mann Ki Baat programme so that people can know about it.
I thank Ion ji for the attention of all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was full of wisdom and intellect, whose writings have left an indelible mark on everybody.
Rabindranath was a talented personality, a multi-dimensional personality, but a teacher inside him can experience every moment.
He wrote in Gitanjali, "He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.
I do not know the language of Bangladesh, but when I was small, I had the habit of getting up very soon - from childhood and the radio of Eastern India starts soon.
When late starts in western India, I am guessing that in the morning, perhaps at 5.30 a.m. Rabindra Sangeet used to start, on the radio and I used to have a habit of it.
Language was not known, I had a habit of listening to Rabindra music on the radio early in the morning and when I got the opportunity to listen to those poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Porashmo, I got a sense of consciousness.
You must have been influenced by Ravindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
The month of Ramzan is celebrated with full respect and respect all over the world.
The social aspect of rosary is that when a person is very hungry then he feels hungry to others.
When he himself feels thirsty, he feels thirsty.
This is an occasion to remember the teachings and messages of Paigambar Mohammad Saheb.
It is our responsibility to walk on the path of equality and brotherhood from his life.
Once a person asked Paigambar Saheb, what is the best work in Islam
Paygambar Saheb said: To feed a poor and needy person and to meet everyone with goodwill, even if you know it or not.
Paygambar Saheb believed in knowledge and compassion.
They had no arrogance of anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Paygambar Mohammad Saheb believed that if you have a thing more than required then you should give it to a needy person and therefore donate in Ramzan is also very important.
People donate to the needy in this holy month.
Paygambar Mohammad Saheb believed that a person is immortal from his soul, not from money and money.
We should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who showed the strength of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima recalls the responsibility of all of us to remember Lord Buddha, to try to walk on his way.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human values that are the most needed in the world today.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar insisted that in his social philosophy Lord Buddha had a great inspiration.
Baba Saheb empowered crores of people who were involved in the Constitution, be it Dalit, be it afflicted, exploited, deprived and marginalised.
It cannot be a bigger example of compassion.
This compassion for the pain of the people was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha.
It is said that the Buddhist monks used to travel to different countries and they used to live with them with the rich ideas of Lord Buddha and it has been happening in every period.
The teachings of Lord Buddha in Asia have been found in our heritage.
Several Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar are connected to Buddha's tradition and Buddha's teachings. And this is the reason why we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects important places of Southeast Asia with India's special Buddhist places.
I am also happy to note that the Government of India is a participant in the renovation works of several Buddhist temples, including the magnificent Ananda temple of centuries old in Myanmar.
Today, everywhere in the world, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the way to eradicate hatred and humiliation.
I wish all those who believe in the principles of compassion and devotion to Lord Buddha spread all over the world on the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima.
I seek blessings from Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility for building a peaceful and compassionate world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the statues of Lafing Buddha, about which it is said that Lafing Buddha brings good luck but very few people know that Smiling Buddha is also associated with an important event of India's defence history.
You will be wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's military power
You will remember that 20 years ago, on the evening of May 11, 18, the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, addressed the nation and his words filled the country with pride, valour and happiness.
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
On 11th May, 1988, at Pokhran, Rajasthan, on the west side of India, nuclear tests were conducted.
India's experiment was successful and in a way, India showcased its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day is marked in the history of India as an exhibition of its military force.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world, the inner power, the power of the inner energy, the power of the inner energy and peace is essential.
Similarly, when you become strong in the form of a country, you can also be peaceful with you all.
The month of May, 18 is not only important for the country that nuclear tests were conducted in this month but it is important for the country to do so.
He showcased the whole world that Indias land is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can achieve pilgrimages and heights.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the mantra - Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan Jai-Science.
However, in view of the journey that Atal ji had started, we will also be able to get a new joy and a new satisfaction.
My dear countrymen, I will talk more when I meet again in Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ram Navami.
My best wishes to the countrymen on this auspicious festival of Ram Navami.
We have seen the strength of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life.
In the last few days, on 26th January, when all the dignitaries of ASEAN countries were here, they had come with them with a cultural group and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana to us.
This means that Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in this land of the world, in ASEAN countries, even today they are creating such an inspiration and influence.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have met all your letters, e-mails, phone calls and comments in large numbers.
I read what Kamal Thakkar ji wrote about starting an online course of Sanskrit on MyGov.
It was very good to see your love for Sanskrit along with being an IT professional.
I have asked the concerned department to inform you about the efforts being made in this regard.
I will also urge the Shratas of Mann Ki Baat who work in the context of Sanskrit to think about what can be done on the suggestions of Kamal ji.
Shri Dhanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar. You read the comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concern that you have expressed on the declining water level in the land is very important.
Shri Shakal Shastri Ji, Karnataka.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal ji, I have delivered your feelings to all the audience.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that this time I talk to the youth about his health.
They feel that our youth is physically weak if compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time talk to everyone in detail about health- Fit India.
And all of you can join hands and drive a Fit India movement.
In the last few days, Prime Minister of France visited Kashi. Shri Prasant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of this journey were touching and affecting the mind.
And he urged that all these pictures should be broadcast on video social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had put the pictures on the same day on the social media and the Narendra Modi App.
Now you like them and retweet them, deliver them to your friends.
Anda, Jaish and many children from Chennai have written to me about the gratitude cards that they have given behind the book Exam Warrior.
Andha, Jayesh, I would like to tell you all the children that these letters of yours will disappear my fatigue throughout the day.
All such letters, so many phone calls, commendations and so many of these things that have been touched by my mind, even if I talk about them then perhaps I have to continue to say something or the other for months.
This time, most of the papers are children who have written about the examination.
He has said his plans on holidays.
In the summer summers water has been anxious for animal birds .
There have been letters of farmer brothers and sisters about the activities related to Kisan Melas and agriculture that are going on across the country.
Some active citizens have suggested water conservation.
There is talk of our festivals, our culture and our traditions during the festivals.
That is, the things of our mind also change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that the things of our mind change the weather of somebody's life.
And why not instead
In these things, in your experiences, in your examples, such inspiration, so much energy, so much spirituality, so much that there is a need to do something for the country.
They have the power to change the climate of the entire country.
When I get to read in your letters, how Ahmed Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj, Assam, has built new schools for the poor children through his will power, then this country's incomparable will power is seen.
Sadul sold households in this mission and collected money through donations.
Several tourists travelling in their cabs were generously donated.
An engineer girl gave her first step
Similarly, after 12 years of collection of rupees, Sadul Laskar brought the color of the Bhagirath effort and due to his hard work today, due to his commitment, he is ready to become a 30-bedded hospital near Puri village near Kolkata.
This is the strength of New India.
Today, the vision of India has changed all over the world.
Today, in the entire country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, every section of the country has awakened the confidence that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward.
It has become a positive environment of self-confidence full of hopes and expectations.
This self-confidence, this positivity will fulfill our resolve of a New India, it will fulfill our dreams.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why many letters have come to agriculture.
This time, I have also visited the DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan with the farmers and I feel that every farmer should connect with this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and implement these experiments in his field.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devilal ji, everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and general life of the country.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji used to emphasize the need for plants, trees and vegetation and greater agricultural structure.
Ramanohar Lohia spoke of mass awareness on a large scale to ensure better income, better irrigation facilities and ensuring food and milk production for our farmers.
In his address in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji stressed the need for the farmers to use new technologies and innovate them.
I went to the Krishi Unnati Mela in Delhi in the last few days.
My interaction with the farmers brothers and sisters and scientists, to know about the experiences related to agriculture, to understand the innovation related to agriculture, all this was a pleasant experience for me but the thing that influenced me was the hard work of Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This state with less area has shown a lot of work.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced vibrant production during 2015-16 over the last five years.
He has shown that when the goal is determined, the determination is strong and the determination in the mind, it can be achieved and shown.
Today the hard work of the farmers is being provided with technology, which is strengthening the agricultural producer.
In the letters that have come to me, I was seeing that many farmers had written about the price of support and they wanted me to talk to them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide a fair price to the farmers.
It has been decided that the price of support for the notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their expenditure.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the villages with the wholesale market and then the global market.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - for this, 22,000 rural hatos of the country will be upgraded with the necessary interface and connected with APMC and e-NAM platform.
In a way, the direct connectivity of any market in the country with the farm is being made.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How can the country celebrate this festival
The Swachh Bharat is our resolve and how can the people of 125 crore people get their shoulders and pay their best respect to Gandhiji
How can new activities be respected for this
I urge you all to share your thoughts with everyone through MyGov.
How should the logo of Gandhi 150
You should suggest how the slogon or the mantra or the announcement can be made.
Together, we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and take inspiration from him and take our country to new heights.
Thank you, you have said the truth and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are supplementary to each other.
Today the country has moved ahead with a conservative approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health in the country was the responsibility of the Ministry of Health only whenever all the departments and Ministries of Health, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Protection or Ministry of Women and Child Development or Ministry of Women and Child Development are working together for a healthy India and emphasis is being laid on affordable health.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and is also the easiest.
And the more awakening the people, the more awakening the livelihood health care, the more awakening the people, the family and the society will also benefit.
Cleanliness is the first need for life to be healthy.
All of us have taken a pledge in the form of a country and the result of this has been that in the last four years, the Sanitation Coverage has doubled to about 80.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up health wellness centres across the country.
This is the result of the commitment of all of us that Yoga has become a collective movement today and has reached home.
There have been less than 100 days left for this time International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
On the last three International Yoga Days, people took part in everywhere in the country and the world with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all of us from now on.
In a new interesting way, Yoga has to be popularized in children, youth, adults and in all ages, men or women.
Though the country's TV and electronic media continue to do various programmes related to Yoga during the year but can we create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher.
Yes, I need Yoga practitioner but some people have also made me Yoga teachers through their creativity and have made 3D Animated Video doing my Yoga.
I will share the video with all of you so that we can practice asana and pranayama together.
Efforts are also being made at a comprehensive level to ensure that healthcare is accessible and affordable to the common man.
The cost of heart stents for heart patients has been reduced to 85.
The number of MBBS sittings in the existing 4 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) is being implemented in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
We all will see collective efforts to get rid of B.
Years ago, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
Industry was an effective medium for them to provide employment to the poorest of them.
Today, when the Make in India campaign is being successfully run in the country, Dr.
The vision of the dream that Ambedkar had dreamed of India as an Industrial Economy is inspiration for us today.
Today, India is emerging as a shining point in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment in the world - FDI is coming to India.
The entire world is looking at India as a hub for investment, innovation and development.
Industry development would be possible only in cities.
Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization of India.
He did not want a person to live his life in poverty.
Together with this, he also believed that poverty cannot be eradicated by distributing something to the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India Initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
During the 1930s and 1940s, when only roads and railways were discussed in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of ports and waterways.
He's Dr.
Babasaheb was the one who saw Jal Shakti as the nation's power.
Emphasizing on the use of water for the development of the country, various River Valley Authorities, Water related Commissions - all these were the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on various beaches of India and interactions are being strengthened on the old ports.
During the 40s, most of the discussions were held in the context of World War II, the Cold War and Division, Dr.
Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of Team India spirit in a way.
He spoke of the importance of federalism, and emphasized on working together with the Union and States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of people associated with backward classes like me.
He has shown to us that it is not necessary to move forward that people born in a big family or a Amir family can also see their dreams, they can fulfil their dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it was also made that many people had Dr.
He tried to push them back, the daughters of the poor and the backward families could not move forward, nothing could be made, they made every possible effort to achieve nothing in their lives.
But the pictures of New India are very different.
An India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor and the backward.
Under this, there will be various programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge you all to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days, many festivals will come. Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi.
On the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life philosophy of Ahimsa's messenger Lord Mahavir ji will inspire all of us.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
On the eve of the discussion of Easter, the inspirational teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave a message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to humanity.
In April, the festival of Baisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India. In these days, Judashital and Satwine in Bihar, Bihu in Assam and Poila Vaisakh in West Bengal will be covered with joy and jealousy.
All these festivals are associated with our farming and foodgrains in some form and through these festivals, we thank nature for the priceless gifts that are produced in the form of yield.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the festivals that will come.
Mann Ki Baat February 2018
My dear countrymen, today we start Mann Ki Baat from a phone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought that the river or the sea or the water becomes colorful
This question came to the mind of a young man in the 1920s.
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India.
The name of Raman comes to us.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on light skettering i. e.
One of his discoverys is known as 'Ruman Effect'.
We celebrate National Science Day every year on 28th February as it is said that on this day the light skating event was discovered, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, there has been a tradition of great dignitaries Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmaputra and Aryabhatta, while on the other hand we are proud of Sushrat and Charak in the field of medicine.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana are proud of India.
The famous particle Boson was also named after Satyendranath Bose.
Recently, I got the opportunity to attend a function in Mumbai to inaugurate the Wadhwan Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It was very interesting to know about the miracles that are happening in the field of science.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor, the deprived or the needy.
In that programme of Artificial Intelligence, I had urged the scientific community to help in making the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can Artificial Intelligence help in facilitating health services and treating diseases modernly
A few days ago, with the Israeli Prime Minister, I had the opportunity to visit the inauguration of I Create in Gujarat, Ahmedabad.
There, a young man has developed a digital infrastructure that if anyone cannot speak, he is able to communicate with writing his words through the Instrument and he can communicate in the same way as a person who can speak.
I believe that we can use Artificial Intelligence in many ways.
Science and Technology values are coastal.
It is not good or bad in terms of value.
Any machine will do as we want.
However, it depends on us what we want to do from the machine.
Human objectives are important here.
Use of science for the welfare of humanity, experiment to achieve the highest heights of human life.
Thomas Alva Adison, who invented the light bulb, failed many times in his experiments.
It is fortunate to note that today I am in Auroville, the land of Maharishi Aurobindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
We searched for answers and waited for humanity.
The feeling of repeated questions to know the truth is important.
This is the true inspiration behind scientific discovery.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I extend my best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science.
My best wishes for our younger generation to be inspired to discover truth and knowledge, to be inspired to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, During the time of crisis, I have received many messages about all these things and people keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh has spoken on the subject of occupational safety in his comments on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He has written that safety parameters on factories and construction sites in our country are not so good.
The next 4th March is Indias National Safety Day, while the Prime Minister spoke on security in his Mann Ki Baat programme, so that security and awareness among the people can be increased.
When we talk about public security, two things are very important - one proactiveness and the other presidency.
Safety is of two types - one which is required at the time of disasters, safety during disorders and others whose daily life is required, safety in emergency life.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily life, we cannot achieve it then it becomes difficult to overcome it during disasters.
We all read the boards written on the roads several times. It has written that the caution has come down, the loss of one mistake, do not leave the world soon after snatching happiness and Muskanit, do not join the world with security, do not make any fun, their life is cheaper and these things are never used in our lives.
If we remain cautious and follow the necessary rules, we can only protect our lives, but we can also overcome the society with great accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of sources are written in the workplace with safety but whenever we want it does not seem to be followed anywhere.
I urge the Mahanagar Palikas, Nagar Palikas, who have fire brigades, they should go to different schools once a week or once a month and drill them in front of school children.
There will be two benefits: The Fire Brigade will also be a habit of being alert and the new generation also gets education and there is no different cost for this. In a way, there is a sequence of education.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading disaster management in the country.
Initiative called Apada Mitra has also been taken for training of volunteers in the risky districts of flood, cyclone.
Training and awareness have a very big role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to Lu Heatway.
Thereafter, NDMA organized workshops for the elimination of HTV and launched a campaign to bring awareness among the people.
The partnership of everyone has resulted in a good result.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to Lu declined to approximately 20.
It can be learned that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people working in this way, be it social organisation, be it awakening citizen - I want to explain to everybody who is in trouble, relief and rescue work within minutes.
And the number of such crime heroes is not less.
(BIMSTEC) - Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal, a Joint Disaster Management Exercise of these countries was one of the first and largest human experiments.
We have to become a Risk Consumption Society.
In our culture, we often talk about the protection of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of value of safety.
We have to make it a part of our lives.
This means what was the arrangement to give information
Because we are not aware of the nature and we hear our ears after sitting in the air, but no one of us feels that this suggestion is for me.
The same experience is in every field of our lives.
We should not imagine that Safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our security then the feeling of security of the society is also included.
The objective of this Gobardhan scheme is to make the villages clean and generate wealth and energy by transforming the dense waste of cattle and farms into compost and bio-gas.
Some European countries and China, cattle dung and other biological wastes are used to produce energy but its full potential is not being used in India.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, we are moving forward in this direction.
The goal of using dhora dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all these biogas based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as waste but as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas.
It will help in keeping villages clean, animal health will be better and productivity will increase.
Biogas will increase self-reliance in energy spheres for cooking and lighting.
The farmers and animal husbands will help in increasing income.
New jobs will be available for waste collection, transportation, biogas sale etc.
An online trading platform will also be set up for the smooth system of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect the farmers to the buyers so that farmers can get the right price of dung and agricultural waste.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially our sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by forming a self-help group.
I invite you to become a participant of this movement of clean energy and green jobs. Take initiatives towards converting waste into wealth and making cow dung from your village.
My dear countrymen, till now we have been listening to music festivals, food festivals, film festivals, etc.
However, a unique effort was made in Raipur, Chhattisgarh in which the first waste festival was organized in the state.
The objective behind the festival organised by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about cleanliness, creation of creative waste of the city and creating awareness about various ways to reuse the carbag.
During this festival, there were several activities in which students and adults participated.
Different types of artefacts were made using waste.
Workshops were organized to educate people on all aspects of waste management.
Music performance was held on the theme of Swachhta and Art Work was built.
Inspired by Raipur, various types of waste festivals were held in other districts too.
Everyone had innovative ideas about cleanliness initiated on their behalf, discussed, poems were read.
In the context of cleanliness, an atmosphere like a festival was created.
The kind of enthusiastic participants, especially the school children, was wonderful.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration of Chhattisgarh for exhibiting the importance of waste management and cleanliness in an innovative manner in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
There are many programmes in the country and the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is also honoured by women who have worked in different fields in the last few days.
On this occasion, I remember the words of Swami Vivekananda.
Today, it is our responsibility to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashodan, Kaushalyanandan, Gandhariputra, this was the identity of a son.
Today our women power has introduced self-sufficiency and self-reliance with their works.
He has not only stepped up himself but has also worked to take the country and the society forward and take it to a new stage.
Finally, our dream of New India is the same where women are empowered, strong and equal partners in the overall development of the country.
In the last few days, somebody had given me a very beautiful suggestion.
He suggested that on 8th March there are several programmes to celebrate Women's Day. Can the honour of those mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town
And you can talk about a long life in it. I feel better to think about it and I am reaching you.
Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, about 15 lakh women - and this figure is not small, 15 lakh women have organized a month-long Swachhta Abhiyan.
Beginning from 26th January, 2018, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
Can you imagine how big is this incident
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will effectively transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into the nature of the common man in a common life.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in News that electricity has reached three villages of Elephanta Islands after 70 years of independence and there is so much jealousy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know well that Elephanta Island is ten kilometres away from the sea from Mumbai .
I was surprised to know that despite being close to Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, there was no electricity in Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Islands Rajbandar, Morbandar and Setbandar, the darkness that was spread in the lives of the people there, are now dark and their lives have become illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the caves of Elephanta and Elephanta will be lighted by electricity.
This is not just a power but a new beginning for development.
The lives of the countrymen should be lightened, happy in their lives, what could be the second moment of satisfaction and happiness
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now in the month of March, the fields decorated with harvesting crops, the golden ripple of wheat and the beauty of mango that fascinates the mind - this is the specialty of this month.
However, this month is also very favorite to all of us for the festival of Holi.
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with joy.
The more important the holi is the Holika Dahan because this day is a day to burn and destroy evils in the fire.
Holi is a good opportunity to forget all the sorrows and be a part of each other's happiness and love gives a message of unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to your fellow countrymen on the festival of Holi.
May this festival be filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat January 2018
This is the first Mann Ki Baat of 2018 and two days ago, we celebrated the Republic with great enthusiasm and for the first time in history it became such that the elders of 10 countries were present in this celebration.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Prakash Tripathy has written a long letter on the Narendra ModiApp and has urged me to touch the subjects written in his letter.
He has written that Kalpa Chawla, who visits the space on February 19, is the death anniversary of Chawla.
He left us in the Colombia spacecraft accident but inspired millions of youth from all over the world.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji that he started his long paper with the farewell of Kalpa Chawla.
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpa Chawla at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of youngsters from all over the world, especially in India that there is no limit for women power.
If there is desire and determination, if there is a strong desire to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is heartening to see that today women in India are moving forward at a rapid pace in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour of women in our country, their place and their contribution to society has been surprised by the entire world.
Indian scholars have a long tradition.
Many scholars of India have contributed to the creation of Vedas loans.
There are many names like Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreyi.
Today we talk about 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' but centuries ago in our scriptures, in Scandpuran, it has been said: 'Dashputra Samakanya, Dasputra Pravardhan.
The more the virtue you get from the ten daughters, the more the virtue you get from a daughter.
This reflects the importance of women in our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of Shakti in our society.
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the unity formula.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has given many further examples.
He has written that our adventurous defence Prime Minister, Nirmala Sithara, is inspiring to fly in the fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30.
He also mentioned the women crew members of the Indian Navy under the leadership of Vartika Joshi, who are performing around the world on the INSV trick.
Three brave women have become Bhava Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi Fighter Pilot and are training in Sukhoi-30.
Under the leadership of Shakti Vajpayee, the All Women Crew flew from Delhi to San Francisco in America and from across Delhi to Air India Boying Jet and all the ladies back.
In the past, the Honble President had taken a new initiative.
The President visited a group of extraordinary women who first performed something in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, the first female merchant Navy captain, the first female train driver of the passenger train, the first female fire fighter, the first female bus driver, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to reach Everest, thus the first ladies of every sector.
Our women powers have broken the conservation of the society and achieved extraordinary achievements and established a creation.
He added that a new path can be prepared by crossing all the obstacles and obstacles on the strength of hard work, integrity and determination.
A road that will not only inspire the people of their contemporary times but also inspire many generations to come.
He will fill them with a new zeal and enthusiasm.
A book on this Women Secretary, First Ladies has also been prepared so that the whole country can know about these women powers, inspire them from their lives and their work.
He is also e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women power plays an important role in the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, when we are talking about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
One railway station and women empowerment, you will be thinking about what is the relationship between these two
Matunga station in Mumbai is India's first station where all women employees are.
Whether it is Women Staff, Commercial Department, Railway Police, Ticket Checker, Industries, Point Person, Staff of more than 40 employees from all departments belongs to women.
This time, many people wrote on Twitter and other social media after visiting the Republic Day parade that the parade was one of the key points of the parade, the BSF biker continent in which all women were participating.
He was experiencing adventurous experiments and this scene was also surprised by the guests from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women power is leading.
When the tribal women talk about it then a definite picture comes up in their minds, in which there are jungles, footpaths and women carrying woods on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh and our women power have made a new picture in front of the country.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area, has created a terrible atmosphere by violent atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols and Maoists.
In such a dangerous area tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-Rikshaw.
Many women have been associated with it in a short span of time.
And there are three benefits from this, on the one hand, where self-employment has worked to empower them, on the other hand, the pictures of the Maoist-affected area are changing.
And with all these things, the work of environmental protection is also being strengthened.
For centuries, efforts have been made at the individual and social level in our country against social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago, Bihar has taken an interesting initiative.
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of over 13 thousand kilometers has been manufactured, human chain.
Through this campaign, people were made aware of the evils like childhood and dahej practice.
The entire state took a pledge to fight with evils like Dahej and Child Marriage.
Children, the elderly, the youth, the mothers and the sisters, who were full of zeal and enthusiasm, everybody had participated in this jungle.
The human chain started from the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna was linked to the boundaries of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in the true sense that our society is free from these evils.
Let us together take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and efficient India.
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the chief ministers of the state, the administration and every person involved in the human chain who made such a special and comprehensive initiative towards the welfare of the society.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Darshan of MyGov, Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov: The cost of medicines was Rs. 6,000 per month on the treatment of his father.
He was not aware of the earlier Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Kendra.
But now when they got information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased to 5.
He expressed his desire that I should talk about it in Mann Ki Baat programme so as to reach out to most people and take advantage of it.
For the past few years, many people used to write and tell me about this.
I have also seen video and social media of many people who have taken advantage of this scheme.
And when I get this information then I am very happy.
There is a deep satisfaction.
And I felt very good that in the minds of Shriman Darshan ji there has been an idea that they can get what they got.
The objectives behind this scheme are to make health care affordable and promote Ease of Living.
The medicines available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are cheaper from about 50 to 70 of the branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the common man, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday and saves a lot.
The generic medicines sold in it are according to the prescribed standards of the World Health Organization.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
It not only provides medicines cheaper but also creates new employment opportunities for industrial enterprises.
Affordable medicines are available on the Amrit Stores of the Prime Minister of India Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals.
The only objective behind all of them is to make the poorest of the country affordable health services available so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shriman Mangesh from Maharashtra has shared a photo on the Narendra Modi mobile app.
The photograph was such that my attention was drawing towards the photographs.
The photographs in which a granddaughter was participating in the cleanliness campaign of the Clean Moorna River along with his grandfather.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola had organised a Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Mora river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Mora river used to flow for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal.
The other painful thing is that the river was completely filled with wild wounds and water poultry.
Several wastes were being put on the river and its shores.
Action Plan was prepared and one day before the Makar Sankranti, two shores of Mora river were cleaned at four places in four kilometres area under the first phase of Mission Clean Mora.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, college students, children, adults, mothers and sisters, everybody participated in this neck work of Mission Clean Moor.
Even on 20th January, 2018, this Swachhta programme was continued in the same way and I was told that till the Moorna river is completely cleaned, this campaign will run every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something then nothing is impossible.
A big change can be brought about through the mass movement.
I express my gratitude to the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the municipal corporation and every citizen engaged in making this work a mass movement and this effort will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, these days you will be listening to many discussions about the Padma Awards.
It also attracts attention on TV and on this subject in the newspapers.
However, you will be proud of how great people are among us and naturally it will also be proud of how the common man in our country is reaching these heights without any feeling.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padma, but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone.
The entire process has become transparent from online.
In a way, the select process of these awards has been completely transformed.
Now there is no identity of a person for awards but the importance of his work is increasing.
You will be happy to know that Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has dedicated his life to making medals for children.
He has been making sports from garbage for four decades so that the knowledge of science in children can increase.
Their efforts are to inspire children to inspire scientific experiments from useless things, for which they are inspiring children by visiting three thousand schools across the country to showcase films made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication.
One such thing is of Sitava Jodhti of Karnataka.
They are not called the goddess of women empowerment.
He has contributed greatly to changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi for the last three decades.
He had dedicated himself as a goddess in the age of seven years but then he spent his entire life for the welfare of the goddesses.
Moreover, he has also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
Shriman Bhaju Shyam was born in a very poor family, a tribal family.
He used to do ordinary jobs for livelihood, but he was keen to create traditional tribal pictures.
Today, because of this gladness, he is honoured not only in India but in the whole world.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy.
The talent of Bhaju Shyam ji, who has named India abroad, was recognized and he was honored with Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to hear about the tribal lady Lakshmikutty of Kerala.
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area amidst dense forests.
He has made five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory.
He has got Maharath in making medicines used after snake bites.
Lakshmiji is constantly serving the society with herbal medicines.
Recognizing this sinful person, he was honored with Padma Shri for his contribution to society.
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils and vegetables in other houses to build a hospital.
When he was 23, his husband died due to lack of treatment and inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hard worked hospitals.
I am sure that there are many men and gems in our multi-ratna Vasundhara, many women and gems who no one knows or knows.
The Padma Puraskar is a medium but I will also tell the countrymen that there are lakhs of people who are living around us, who are dedicated to society, who have been dedicated to society, who have been working with some specialty and sometimes in the middle of the society.
They do not work for respect and respect but because of their work we get inspiration.
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should listen to their experiences.
Beyond the awards, some efforts should be made in the society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is 9th January when revered Mahatma Gandhi had returned to India from South Africa.
On that day, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bondage between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we had organized a programme in which all the members and mayors of Indian origin from all over the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in the programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America and some other countries where our original Indian mayor is, where the original Indian Parliamentarians have participated.
I am glad that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as have made strong relations with India. This time, I have sent the European Union, the European Union to me a calendar in which they have demonstrated their contribution in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Our original Indians who live in different countries of Europe, who are working in a cyber security, who are dedicated to Ayurveda, who drive the minds of the society with their music and some of their poems.
I would like to thank you for the remarkable work of the European Union, for the recognition of the people of Indian origin and for giving information to the people around the world through them.
On 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
At present, we should take every step that how true Bapu's words were.
If we pledge that we can walk on the path of Bapu, what can be a greater tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
Mann Ki Baat December 2019
This is the last programme of Mann Ki Baat this year and see the coincidence that today is the last day of 2019.
This year we and you shared a lot of things.
Exchange of all your letters, comments and ideas for Mann Ki Baat always brings a new energy for me.
Years will change after a few hours but this sequence of our things will continue in the same way.
In the coming years, we will do more innovative things, we will share new experiences.
My best wishes to you all for the year 2018.
Recently, on December 25, the festival of Natal was celebrated worldwide with humor.
People in India also celebrated this festival with great enthusiasm.
On this occasion of Christmas, we all recall the great teachings of Jesus Christ and what Isha Masih had emphasized was 'Sevabhav'.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the year of 350th light festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the great values of life and he lived his life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a guru, a poet, a philosopher and a great warrior, worked to inspire people in all these roles.
He fought against producing and injustice.
He advised people to break the bonds of caste and religion.
In these efforts, he had to lose a lot personally.
But he never gave place to the feeling of hatred.
In every moment of life, the message of love, sacrifice and peace was his personality full of great features.
Let us take all the pledges and take inspiration from Guru Gobind Singhji's great teachings and inspiring life and try to transform life accordingly.
Those who are born in 2000 or after that will become eligible voters from January 1, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century, New India voters.
I congratulate our youth and urge everyone to register as your voter.
The whole of India is keen to welcome you as your 21st century voter.
You will also be proud of being a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be the basis of New India.
The strength of vote is the biggest strength in democracy.
Mat is the most effective tool to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
However, you can also become the producer of the 21st century of India and it is being started specially from January 1.
And today, in this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to our youth full of energy and determination of 18-25 years.
I am confident that the skills and strength of these youngsters will fulfill our dream of New India.
When we talk about a New India, a New India that is free from the poison of casteism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Be free from dirt and poverty.
New India - where there are equal opportunities for all, where the aspirations of all are fulfilled.
New India where peace, unity and harmony are our inspirational strength.
My New India Youth will come forward and how it will be a New India.
They will also set a road for themselves, connect them with which they are connected and continue to move forward.
You also move forward, the country also moves forward.
When I am talking to you today, I had a thought that can we organize a mock parlor in every district of India
Where these 18-25 years of age will sit together and churn on New India, find roads, plans.
How will we achieve our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India that was dreamed by our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had made the freedom movement a mass movement.
My young friends, the time requires that we also create a mass movement for the 21st century grand and divine India.
How to achieve with determination
Today, many new opportunities are created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are coming forward and succeeding.
I would like to know about all these occasions as to how this New India Youth should be established in one place and a system should be created in this regard so that when 18 years of age, they can facilitate information about this world and take necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, I talked about the importance of positiveness.
I remember a shlock of Sanskrit - it means a person full of enthusiasm is very powerful because nothing can happen beyond enthusiasm.
There is nothing impossible for a positive and enthusiastic person.
People in English also say - 'Pessimism Leaders to Weekness, Optimism to Power'.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to tell you the positive moments of the year 2019 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am happy that a large number of people gave a lot of positive representation on the social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
Millions of tweets were made with Positive India Hashtag, which reached more than 1.
In a way, the transmission of positiveness in India spreads around the world.
The tweets and talents that came inspiring were really inspiring.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some countrymen have shared the events of this year that had a special impact on their minds and had a positive impact.
Some people shared their personal achievements.
My name is Manu Bhatia.
I live in Mayur Vihar, Pocket One, Faz One, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Vade.
I talk to the Bodel.
Our insurance covered a premium of one rupee per month.
She was done by my husband and died in an accident.
We only know what happened to us at that time.
With this help of the government, we got a lot of benefit and I could have a little meeting with it.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
From our village, the National Highway has been passing from Bhinar village since 2019.
Our roads have become very good and business will also increase.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja, Area Sadatganj, District Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a problem of water in our area and for the last 40 years we had to depend on the Army pipeline.
Now this pipeline has been made separately - free.
So all these major achievements are in our 2019.
There are many people who are doing such work at their respective levels which are bringing about positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India which we are building together.
Come, let us enter the New Year with the same little happiness, start a New Year and take a strong step in the direction of positive India to Progressive India.
When we talk about positiveness, I also feel like sharing one thing.
Recently, I got to know the inspirational point of the top Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak of the administrative service in Kashmir.
He has come out of the terror and hatred and achieved the first rank in the examination of the Kashmir Administrative Service.
You will be surprised to know that in the 10th, the terrorists burnt their ancestral houses.
Terrorism and violence were so much that their family had to leave their native land and come out.
For a small child, the atmosphere of such violence around him was enough to produce darkness and bitterness in his heart - but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He crossed the opposite situation and wrote his own story of success.
Today, he has become an inspiration for not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that the clouds of despair can also be spread through positive actions, however bad the situation is.
Just last week, I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of Jammu and Kashmir.
The zeal and zeal that was in them, the dreams that were in them and when I was listening to them, they want to progress in what fields of life.
The time I spent with those daughters, I also got inspiration and this is the strength of the country, this is my youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk of famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala.
In this world famous temple, thousands of devotees come here every year to take the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami.
Where such a large number of devotees come, where such a great place is Mahatma, how big challenge is it to maintain cleanliness
And especially those places which are located between mountains and forests.
However, the Sabarimala temple itself is an example of how this problem can be transformed into a culture, how to find out the way out of the problem and how it is so powerful in public participation.
P.
A police officer, Vijayan, launched a Punyam Punkvanam programme and launched a voluntary campaign of awareness for cleanliness under the programme.
And made a tradition that those travellers who come, their journey does not complete until they do any physical work in the Swachhta programme.
There is no bigger or smaller in this campaign.
Every traveller considers a part of the worship of God and gives some time for cleanliness, works and works to remove dirt.
Everyday in the morning the scene of cleanliness is very marvellous and all the pilgrims get engaged in it .
Whether it is not a big CELEBRITY, no matter how much wealthy person, no matter how big officer, every individual becomes a part of this programme like a common traveller and moves forward by cleaning it.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan in Sabarimala and the Panyam Punkvanam in it become a part of the journey of every traveller.
At the same time, there is a strong resolve of cleanliness along with a hard drive.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, we all have resolved that the incomplete work of revered Bapu is Swachh Bharat, the free India of dirt.
Possibly Bapu continued to struggle for this work throughout his life.
And we all decided that when Bapu's 150th birth anniversary is there, we should do something or the other in the direction of giving him the India of his dream, a Swachh Bharat.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
Transformation is also being seen by comprehensive public participation in rural and urban areas.
To examine the level of sanitation in urban areas, the worlds largest survey - Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be held between January 4 and March 10, 2018.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4,000 cities in a population of about 40 crore.
The facts that will be examined in this survey, open defecation free in cities, waste collection, transportation systems for carrying waste, scientific efforts for waste processing, behavioural change, innovative efforts made for cleaning and public participation for this work.
During this survey, various teams will visit cities and interpret cities.
He will interact with the citizens and respond to them.
The Swachhta App will analysis the use and improvement of various types of services.
It will also be seen whether such arrangements have been made by the cities so that the cleanliness of the city becomes the nature of the people and the nature of the city.
Cleanliness should not be done only by the government.
Every citizen and civil organisation also has a big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to take part in the Swachhta Survey in the days to come.
And your city should not be lagging behind, let your streets not be lagging behind.
I am confident that the use of green and blue waste has become your habit by separating dry waste and wet waste from home.
In the Swachhta Survey held from 4th January to 10th March, 2018, you should not be left behind in this healthy competitiveness of cleanliness, it should be a subject of public discussion in every city.
And your dream should be our city - our efforts, our progress - the progress of the country.
Let us once again remember the revered Bapu and take a pledge to Swachh Bharat and perform Purusharth.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that look very small to see, but as a society, it is going to affect our identity far and wide.
Today, through this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share such a thing with you.
One thing came in our knowledge that if a Muslim woman wants to go for a Haj pilgrimage then she cannot go without Mahram or her Male Guardian.
When I heard about it for the first time, I thought how could this happen
Who would have made such rules
Why does this kind of discrimination come
And when I went deep into it, I was distressed - even after 70 years of independence, we were the people who used such a test.
For decades, injustice was being done to Muslim women but there was no discussion about them.
Even in many Islamic countries, there is no rule.
But Muslim women in India did not get this authority.
And I am glad that our government has focused on it.
Our Ministries of Minority Affairs also took necessary steps and we removed this resistance by abolishing the tradition that has been going on for 70 years.
Today, Muslim women can go to Haj without honour and I am glad that this time about 1300 Muslim women have applyed for Haj without honour and from different parts of the country, from Kerala to North, women have expressed their desire to enthusiastically travel to Haj.
I am confident that India's development journey, the strength of our women power, the confidence of their talent, will continue to move forward and move forward.
We must continue to make efforts that our women also get equal rights to men, equal opportunities so that they can move forward together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for us.
On Republic Day, there will be no one but ten chief guests this time.
This has never happened before in India's history.
2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2019 and completed 25 years of Indias partnership with ASEAN in 2019.
It is a matter of pride for our Indians to be present together with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Dear countrymen, this festival is a season of festivals and our country is a country of festivals in a way.
Perhaps there will be a day in which no festival has been written in the name.
Now we all have celebrated Christmas and a New Year will come forward.
May the coming New Year bring happiness, happiness and prosperity to all of you.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new resolve, and move forward the country too.
The month of January is the time of the sun to be Uttarayan and in this month Makar Sankranti is celebrated.
Lohari is enjoyed in Punjab and North India, while UP-Bihar is waiting for Khichdi and Til-Sankranti.
Say Sankrant in Rajasthan, Magh-Bihu in Assam or Pongal in Tamil Nadu, every festival is special in itself and has its own importance.
Every festival is celebrated from 13th to 1st January.
The names of these festivals are different, but their original elements are the same - connectivity with nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to every countrymen on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, my countrymen.
Now I will talk again in 2018.
Thank you.
It was such a conversation that speaks with a lot of interest, smaller brothers and their elder sisters.
Listen, how in this phase of AYUSH, Lata Didi is eager for all the things related to the country and the satisfaction of life is also in the progress of India, in the changing India, in the touching new heights.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, Pranam.
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata Didi: Pranam.
Modi ji: I did the phone because this time on your birthday...
When will you go back to the layer
Modi ji: I will return late at 28th and at 2nd in the morning and then you must have been your birthday.
Lataji: There are many people in the age but it is a big thing to get the blessings of those who are bigger than their own work.
Modi ji: Didi, you are very old in age and you are too old in work and the achievements you have achieved have been achieved by means and penance.
Lataji: Yes, I think that my parents have blessings and blessings of the audience.
I'm nothing.
Modi ji: Yes, this is your gratitude. It is a great education for all of our new generations.
It is a great inspiration for us that even after clearing all these things in the life given, your parents have always given priority to the culture and humility.
Lataji: J.
Modi ji: And I am happy that when you say proudly that your mother was Gujarati.
Modi ji: And whenever I came to you, G. Modi ji gave me something or the other Gujarati.
I know that the picture of India is changing due to your arrival and I am very happy with it.
No, I do not want to give you a lot of trouble because I see, I know how busy you are and how much work you have.
What do you have to think
When you went and visited your mother's footsteps, I had sent somebody to them and blessed them.
Yeah.
Modi ji: My father was very happy, because of your love.
Modi ji: But the time was so busy that I could not come.
Modi ji: But I will come very soon.
It will be my privilege.
Modi ji: Praman Didi.
Lataji: Very greetings.
Modi ji: Pranam ji
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the atmosphere of festivals will once again be filled with new enthusiasm, new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve.
The season of festivals is N.
Festivals will be a glimpse of festivals across the country for several weeks.
The house will be filled with happiness.
Perhaps, this word is not just a word, it is an order, a philosophy, an inspiration for all of us.
In some households, sweets get spoiled and in some households children are sweet.
This is the darkness in the bottom of Diu.
The real joy of these festivals is when the darkness is over, the darkness is reduced and the brightness spreads.
We share happiness, where there is a lack of happiness and it becomes our nature.
Think of giving sweets, clothes and gifts to each other in our homes where delivery is done.
At least, the things that we do not take in our households, should be shared in each other.
In many cities, start-ups of young friends from many NGs work like this.
They collect clothes, sweets, meats from the houses of the people and explore the needy and reach them.
Can this time, with full awareness and determination in this season of festivals, eradicate darkness at the bottom of Diu
The memories on the face of many poor families will double your happiness on festivals and your face will glow.
Your lamp will become more bright and your lamp will brighten.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmiji's house comes in the form of fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
Lakshmiji is welcome in a traditional way.
Can we keep honoured programmes in our society, in villages, in cities and daughters this time
Can we have public programmes
There will be many daughters among us who would have been named after their hard work and talent, family, society and country.
Can we honour this Laxmi of India on this Diwali
There will be many daughters and many sisters around us who would have been doing extraordinary work.
Some poor children would have been working to teach and somebody would have started spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, then some doctor would have been serving the society as an engineer.
You must have been trying to bring justice to anyone by becoming a lawyer.
May our society identify, respect and take pride in these daughters.
His honour programmes will be held across the country.
Promotion of Laxmi of India means paving the way for the prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had earlier said that one of the greatest benefits of Mann Ki Baat is that I get the privilege of directly interacting with many known people.
I am from Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my exam resulted, some people asked me to read the exam warriors book
I didn't read this book.
But after coming back, I read this book and read it twice or three times.
My experience was very good about this.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination, I would have got a lot of benefit.
My little student friend, first thank you for writing this letter.
Thank you for reading exam warriors 2-3 times.
You have said that if I can take time for a new turn then I will definitely try to write some things for parents and teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and parents of the country to give me your experience about the aspects related to the stress-free examination.
So I'll wait for your thoughts.
Once again I express my gratitude to our younger friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you are also aware of the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through news papers and through TV.
But you know that I am also a common man like you.
I am an ordinary citizen and therefore, the impact of things that affects in a common life is also on my mind because I have come from amongst you.
Just a short while ago, he had lost the Grand Slam winner and the tales of Tannis from Rafael Nadal to the final.
The audience present there welcomed their speeches.
Even after losing the difficult challenges, he praised his rival drain and gave a living proof of the sportsman.
However, on the other hand, the winners of Daniel also lauded the game.
The zeal of the winners in the same match and the humility of the winners were both worth seeing.
If you have not heard the statement of Daniel Medvedev, I will tell you all, especially the youth to see this video.
The thinking of our ancestors is really commendable.
We say there in the scriptures: I mean, when an individual consolidates the qualification and humility together, then who cannot win the heart
In fact, this young sportsperson has won the hearts of people from all over the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about is being done directly for your good.
The debate will continue, the opposition will continue, but if some things are stopped before the increase, then there is a lot of benefit.
It is very difficult to stop the things that increases very much and spread very much.
But in the beginning, if we are aware, we can save a lot.
My heart says that in this sense, today, especially the young friends should do some things.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and its addiction becomes very difficult.
The danger of diseases like cancer, diabetes and blood pressure increases to those who consume tobacco.
This is what everyone says.
The intoxication of tobacco is due to necotine present in it .
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of the brain.
But today I want to talk to you on a new topic.
You will be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
E-cigarettes are a kind of electronic equipment different from normal cigarettes.
The e-cigarette warms the nicotine liquid substances and creates a kind of chemical dust through which nicotine is consumed.
We understand the danger of ordinary cigarettes very well, but a wrong concept of e-cigarette has been created.
There is a misunderstanding that there is no danger from e-cigarettes.
Like the rest of the cigarettes, aromatic chemicals were obtained in it to not spread the odour.
We have seen around that even if there is a father-in-law smoker in the house, he stops smoking the rest of the household and wants that their children do not have the habit of cigarettes and beeds.
Their efforts are such that no member of the family does not smoke, do not smoke.
They know that smoking and tobacco causes heavy damage to the body.
Pinaras also know and seekers also know.
However, the cases of e-cigarette are very different.
There is no such awareness among people about e-cigarettes.
They are completely unaware of its dangers and sometimes e-cigarettes enter the house secretly and sometimes I am showing magic and children are showing each other.
Look, I take out a smoke from my mouth. Look, without a fire, without a smoke, you see, I take out a smoke.
Once the adolescents and youngsters of the house get stuck in their clutches then gradually they become victims of this drug addiction.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are obtained in e-cigarettes, which have a bad impact on health.
You are aware that whenever someone smokes around us, we know it from smell.
Even if there is a packet of cigarettes in its kitchen then it is known by smell.
However, there is no such thing with e-service. In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are seen roaming in their hands with pride in their books, in their offices, in their chairs, sometimes in their hands and become victims of fashion statements.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
E-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of drug addiction does not ruin our young country.
Do not put the dreams of every family and the lives of the children will not be ruined.
This disease, this habit, does not put the roots in the society.
I urge you to leave the intoxication of tobacco and do not have any illusions regarding e-cigarettes.
Let us all together build a healthy India.
All these things have to be saved for Fit India.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for all of us that our India year has been the birthplace and dedication of exceptional people who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for the welfare of others.
This is our Mother India, this is our country's adornment of multilateralism.
Several humanitarians emerge from this earth.
India has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people.
And these are those people who have dedicated themselves not for themselves but for others.
One such great achievement is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pop France will declare Marium Thresia a saint on October 13.
The work that Sister Mary Thraces has done for the welfare of humanity in his short life of 50 years is an example for the entire world.
Whatever work Sister Thresia has done, with dedication and dedication, completed it.
Those who are still moving forward their lifestyle and missions.
Once again I pay homage to Sister Maryam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, not only India, it is a matter of pride for the entire world that today when we are celebrating 150, 130 crore Indians have pledged to free themselves from single use plastic.
In the direction of environmental protection, the kind of leadership that India has led all over the world, today the eyes of all countries are on India.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on October 2.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way.
However, a new youth of our country has started a very unique campaign.
When I was focused on this work, I tried to know about this new experiment by talking to them on the phone.
These things can be done to other people of the country.
Mr. Repudaman Belviji is making a good effort.
When I heard the word plogging for the first time, it was also new for me.
Perhaps those words have been used in some quantities abroad.
But in India, Repudaman Belviji has made a lot of publicity.
I congratulate them and my friends, this time the Ministry of Sports is also going to organise the Fit India Planning Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
We have heard how this programme should be done and what happens in the programme with the experience of Riputman ji.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction, then India will move forward in the direction of getting rid of single use plastic.
Once again, thanks to Riputman ji.
We want to move forward to transform our lives into patriotism.
One thing is intended to be remembered soon.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely make it in detail, but today I am telling you for a long time so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember that on October 31, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patels birth anniversary.
We have to run for the unity of the country on that day in lakhs of villages of India, children, elderly, all the schools, colleges and thousands.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022 you will go to 15 places of India.
Make a programme to stay at least 15 places and at least one night, two nights.
You see Hindustan, understand, experience.
We have so many diversity and when the days of the festival of Diwali come, people definitely go and therefore I will urge you to visit any of these 15 places of India.
And how much is this reform, where am I to you
You will be happy to note that today our number is 34 and our rank was 65th five years ago, that is, in a way we have made a big jump.
If we strive hard, we will make our place in the world's leading places in tourism till the age of 5 years of independence.
Yes, it must also be seen that in the days of Diwali, due to cracks, etc. there is no harm to any person.
You must keep the precautions that should be taken for it.
There should be happiness, joy and enthusiasm and our festivals also bring the aroma of community and also bring the culture of community.
Community life gives a new strength and festivals are the centre of the means of this new potential.
Let us celebrate festivals with fervor and enthusiasm, with new dreams and new resolves.
Once again my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with the child friends of Karnataka.
The Times Group's Vijay Karnataka newspaper called upon the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country by making an initiative.
And then he published some of these selected letters.
I read those letters and I felt very good.
These small children are also familiar with the problems of the country and the ongoing discussions in the country.
On many subjects, these children have written, Kirti Hegde of North Kannada has suggested by describing the Digital India and Smart City Scheme that we need to change our education system, he added that today children do not like to study in classrooms.
And if we inspire children about nature, then perhaps we can be able to move forward in protecting the environment.
Reeda Nadaf from Lakshmeshwar has written that it is the daughter of a soldier.
And he has said that because of the distant school, I cannot spend time with my friends, he has suggested that there should be a school nearby.
It was a good experience for me too.
My dear countrymen, today is 26th November.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On this day of 1947, the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember those members of the Constituent Assembly.
He worked hard for about three years to build the Constitution of India.
And whenever they read the discussion, we are proud that what is the idea of life dedicated to the nation.
Can you imagine how hard they might have worked to build the Constitution of our country with diversity
You must have seen understanding and insight and that too at a time when the country was getting free from the blankets of slavery.
Keeping this Constitution in mind, it is our duty to create a New India keeping in mind the ideas of the Constitution and those great men.
Our Constitution is very comprehensive.
Perhaps there is no such area of life, there is no such subject of nature which he has not touched.
Equality for everyone and sensitivity towards everyone is the identity of our Constitution.
It protects the fundamental rights of every citizen, the poor or the Dalit, the backward or the deprived, the tribal and women.
And keep their interests safe.
Our duty is to comply with the letters of the Constitution.
Be it citizen or administrator, move forward in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution.
Seventy different committees were formed on important topics in this Constituent Assembly.
It was one of the most important committees, and Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of this Committee.
He was playing a very important role.
Today, we feel proud of the Constitution of India, there is an unprecedented impression of Babasaheb Ambedkars efficient leadership.
He ensured that every section of the society is benefitted.
On 6th December, on his Mahaparinirvana Day, we commemorate him like Kayam and salute him.
Babasaheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and powerful is unforgettable.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is on the holy occasion.
Sardar Patel, who was the iron man of the country from the farmer's son, had done extraordinary work to build the country on a stem.
Sardar Sahib was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for basic rights, minorities and tribals.
26-11 is our Constitution Day but the terrorists attacked Mumbai on 26-11 nine years ago, how can the country forget it
This country can never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism today looks at every part of the world and in a way has become a terrible form of every day-to-day event.
We have been tolerating the cause of terrorism in India for the last 40 years.
There were many people in the world who were not ready to take it seriously but today whenever terrorism is dragging their own twists, every government in the world is looking at terrorism as a big challenge that believes in humanism and the governments that trust in democracy.
Terrorism has challenged the humanity of the world.
Terrorism has challenged humanism.
He is going to destroy human powers.
And that is why not only India but also all the humanitarian forces of the world together have been defeating terrorism.
Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi are the gems of this earth who have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism weaken our social tensions and try to distinguish them.
And that is why it is the need of the hour to be more aware of humanitarian powers.
My dear countrymen, on 4th December we will celebrate Naval Day- Naval Day.
The Indian Navy protects and protects our shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You all will be aware that our civilization is on the banks of rivers.
Whether it is Sindhu, Ganga, Yamuna or Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important for both economic and strategic purposes.
This is our entrance for the entire world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable relationship with the oceans.
And when we look at history, Chaulnavi-Chaulnaukadal was considered one of the most powerful naval forces at the time of Chaulvansh.
In the expansion of the Chaul Empire, it was a great part of his navy in making the economic power of that time.
Chaul Navy's joke and search trips are still found in Sangam literature.
Very few people would know that women were allowed on long-term warships in most of the naval forces in the world.
However, in the Chaulnaukadal and that too, eight hundred and nine hundred years ago, women played a very important role in the fighting and even women were involved in the fighting.
The Chaul rulers had a rich knowledge of building ships and building ships.
If we talk about the Navy then who can forget their capabilities of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Navy.
The sea shore of Konkan, where the rivers are very important, used to come under the kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts related to Shivaji Maharaj like Indus Fort, Murud Janjira, Swarnadurg etc. were either on the banks of the sea or surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy was responsible for the protection of these forts.
Large ships and small boats were organized in the Maratha Navy.
Their naval personnel were very skilled to attack and avoid any enemies.
And whenever we talk about the Marathas Navy, how can it be possible to remember Kanoji Angre
He took the Marathas Navy to a new height and set up several places for the Marathas Navy.
After independence, our Indian Navy also showed its valour at different times.
Whether it is the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan war of 11.
In May-June this year, when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy immediately reached there and helped the government and its people.
In the month of September last year in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS also provided humanitarian assistance to Rohingya.
In the month of June, when the government of Papua-Nugiene sent us the message of Takid and requested the fishermen to save their fisheries, our Navy helped us.
Our Navy ship INS Trikund also came to help in the release of a commercial ship in the West Account on 21st May.
Our Navy has always been working proudly to provide healthcare to Fiji Islands, to provide immediate relief to the neighbouring country.
We are always proud and respected by the Indians, our defence forces, be it the ground, the Navy or the Air Force, the courage, courage, valour and sacrifices of our soldiers, every countrymen salute.
1. 25 billion Indians can live the life of Sukhchen so that they sacrifice their lives for the country to go.
We celebrate the seventh December every year as the Armed Forces Flag.
It is that day to express pride and respect for the Armed Forces of this country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to run the campaign from 1st to 7th December and reach the citizens of the country and make people aware about the Armed Forces.
Put all these flags on the chest throughout the week.
A movement of respect for the army in the country will start.
On this occasion, we can also distribute the flag of the Armed Forces.
The experiences of those armed forces who are associated with their identification in their surroundings can be posted with video and photographs armedforcesflagday.
In schools, colleges, the soldiers of the armed forces can get information from them.
Our new generation can have a good opportunity to understand the army.
This celebration also provides an opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our Armed Forces.
This fund is spent on the welfare of the families of the soldiers who were martyred in the war and their rehabilitation for the welfare of the injured soldiers by the Military Welfare Board.
Let us do something on this occasion so that the morale of our armed forces increases.
Let us also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is World Soil Day.
I also want to talk to our farmer brothers and sisters.
There is an important part of the earth - soil.
Whatever we eat is connected to this soil.
In a way, the entire food grain is connected to the soil.
It feels fearful even if there was no land or if there were no leaves then human life would have been possible.
It was a matter of concern for the animals that were possible in our culture a long time ago and we have been aware of the importance of our land since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand it is an easy endeavour to remain in the fields, towards soil, devotion and respect of the people. On the other hand, the scientific methods that continue to nurture this land have been a part of our life.
Both things have been important in the lives of the farmers of this country, including devotion to their land as well as scientific conservation of land.
I heard about the farmers of Tohu village of Bhoranj taluk in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use fertilizers and fertilizers beforehand, and due to this the health of their land was deteriorating.
As a result, the yield was decreasing and the income was also decreasing and the production of land was also decreasing.
Some farmers of the village understood the seriousness of this situation and after that they tested their land from time to time and advised them to use as much fertilizers, fertilizers, micro-nutritional elements and organic fertilizers.
You will also be surprised to hear the consequences that what was the result of the implementation of the guidance given to the farmers through the land health.
These farmers have grown three to four times the production of wheat during the Rabi 2016-17.
Our farmers across the country have constructed more than 10 crore soil health cards so that they can understand their land better and harvest them.
We worship Mother Earth, but how much harm do we harm the health of Mother Earth with chemical fertilizers like urea
Every kind of scientific experiment has proved that giving more urea to the mother of the earth is a serious loss.
It is the demand of today's time to re-aware the relationship of this mother and daughter.
Can our farmers, our sons of the earth make this pledge that the amount of urea they use today will half the use of it when it will be 5 years of independence in 2022
How to change the lives of the farmers
We all have started feeling global warming and climate change.
There was a time when the cold started before Diwali.
Today, the 12th of December is blowing up and the cold is increasing gradually.
However, as the cold starts, we all feel that it does not seem good to get out of the holiday.
However, in such a season, people who are constantly awake and are inspiring for all of us.
This little child Tushar has done inspirational work to spread the message of cleanliness.
He explains that there is no age of cleanliness or there is no limit.
Whether it is a small child or an elderly person, a woman or a man, cleanliness is essential for all.
And for cleanliness, there is also a need to cook every corner.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have a commitment.
In a moment we learn something or the other.
Today they are doing well in every field.
Whether it is a field of sports or a competition or a social initiative, our Divyangjans are not behind anyone.
You must remember that our Divyang sportspersons had won four medals in the Rio Olympics and also made a champion in the Bland Tea Twenty Cricket World Cup.
Several types of competitions are held across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Paraswimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country participated in it and introduced their skills.
He also won the Gold in the 70th National Para Swimming Competition.
He was selected by the Sports Authority of India for the 20-20 parallelmix competition.
He is one of the 32 Para-Tarnaviroes who will be trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
I salute Bhai Jigar Thakkar and convey my best wishes to him.
Today, special attention is being given to the availability and opportunities for Divyangjans.
It is our endeavour to empower every person of the country.
Becoming an inclusive society, let us integrate the society with the spirit of mother and mother and move forward together.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of this festival will inspire all of us to increase peace and harmony in the society.
Forget sadness, and don't forget happiness.
I think we should propagate this thing.
We are trying to recall many interesting events of the last year in the media of broadcasting.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences of our life this year
Remember such inspirational occasions to others.
If I remember good things then the feeling of doing good will wake up and the mood will become.
Good things give the energy to do well.
And I will try to reach out to the countrymen in the next Mann Ki Baat on your Positive India Heshtag Positive India.
My dear countrymen, the next month will come back to you for Mann Ki Baat.
There will be an opportunity to talk a lot.
2nd October, 2019 on All India Radio
The Mahaparva Chhath, celebrated six days after Diwali, is one of the most regulations and festivals celebrated in our country.
In which traditional regulations are followed in every matter ranging from food to costume.
The unique festival of Chhath Puja is completely connected with nature and the worship of nature .
The sun and water are at the centre of worship of the Mahaparva Chhath, but bamboo and mud-made utensils and pots are integral to its worship.
In this great festival of faith, the message of worship of the sun rising and setting up of the sun is full of incomparable culture.
The crucial expression of cleanliness in our lives is also present in this festival.
Before the sixth, the entire house is cleaned along with rivers, ponds, ponds, ponds, pujasthanas, i. e.
Surya Vandana or Chhath Puja is also a festival of environmental protection, disease prevention and discipline.
Normally, people understand the feeling of inferiority in seeking something but in Chhath Puja, there has been a special tradition of eating prasad in the morning.
Behind this tradition of seeking prasad, it has also been reflected that the ego is destroyed.
It is very natural for everyone to be proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat continues to be appreciated and discussed.
But whenever I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with a hundred per cent unbreakable relationship with the people of this country.
Take examples of khadi and handicraft.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I have always been advocating for handicraft, Khadi and what is the result of this
You must have been happy to hear that such a huge sale of Khadi and handicraft on the same store.
During Diwali, the sale of Khadi Gift coupons has increased by about 680.
The total sales of khadi and handicraft items have shown an increase of about 70 this year over the last year.
It shows that today the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every adult like Khadi and Handloom.
I can imagine how much benefit has been given to many poor families, poor families and families working on handicrafts.
Khadi is becoming a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor and the poorest of the poor.
This is playing a very big role for Gramodya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on the Narendra Modi App that he wants to know about my experience of Diwali with the security forces and he also wants to know how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Shriman Tejas Gaikwade has also written on the Narendra Modi App. Why can there be arrangements for delivering sweets to the security forces of our house
We also remember our brave security forces.
We also feel that the sweets of our house should reach the people of the country.
You must have celebrated Diwali with great joy.
I had a special experience for Diwali this time too.
Once again, I was fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our armed security forces at the border.
This time, it was unforgettable for me to celebrate Diwali with security forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every soldier of our security forces on behalf of every countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces protect the country by confronting the difficult and odd conditions on the border.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experience of our soldiers, we should listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only on our border but also around the world.
Being the UN Peace Ambassador, he is calling the name of Hindustan in the world.
Recently, on October 24, UN Day was celebrated worldwide.
Everyone remembers the UN's efforts to establish peace in the world and its positive role.
And we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important UN initiatives since the beginning.
You will be aware that the proposal of the Constitution of India and the proposal of the UN Charter begins with the words of WETHE PEOPLE.
India has always emphasized on women equality and is a living proof of UNDECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
All men were burn free and equivalent, which was replaced by the efforts of Indias representative Hansa Maheta and later accepted, All Human Beings are burn free and equivalent.
Though it seems to be a very small change but a healthy idea is seen in it.
There will be many of your mothers who will be getting this information for the first time.
More than 18,000 Indian security forces have served them in UN PEACEKEPING OPERATIONS.
At present, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN PEACEKEPING INITIATIVES and is the third largest figure in the world.
By August 2019, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 Operations of the United Nations's 1 PEACEKEPING Operations.
The OPERATIONS runs in many countries in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, world territory.
More than 20,000 patients have been treated and countless people have been saved in the Indian Army Hospital in Congo and South Sudan.
The security forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also won their hearts by making people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in establishing peace.
Very few people must be aware that India was the first country to send the Female Police Unit to the United Nations Peace Abhiyan in Liberia.
And see, this step of India has become an inspiration to the nations around the world.
And then all the countries started sending women police units to their respective countries.
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only limited to peacekeeping operations but India also works to train the peacekeepers of about 85 countries.
From this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers have conveyed a message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping operations are not easy.
Our security forces have to work in remote areas.
We have to live in different people.
Different situations and different cultures have to be learned.
They have to move themselves in accordance with the local requirements and environment there.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was honored with the Param Vir Chakra.
Lt Gen Premchand ji is one of the Indian Peacekeeper who created a unique identity in Cyprus.
He was made the Force Commander for Operation in Namibia at the age of 18th and provided his services to ensure the independence of the country.
General Thimayya, who has also been the Chief of the Indian Army, led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and laid down all his work for peace.
India has always been a messenger of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
We believe that everybody lives with peace, harmony and moves towards building a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our revered land has been decorated with such great people who have served humanity with selflessness.
Sister's statement, which we call Bhagini's statement, was also one of the extraordinary people.
He was born as Margaret Elizabeth Nobel in Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda gave him a statement.
And the statement means that it is completely dedicated.
Later, he proved himself as per his name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Statement.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister's statement was sorry with the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only made our country a slave but they also tried to make us a mentally slave.
This work continued to be done by showing the bottom of our culture and creating a sense of inferiority in us.
Bhagini Nivedita ji reaffirmed the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to unite people by awakening national awareness.
He went to different countries of the world and raised voice against the propaganda of eternal religion and philosophy.
Famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharati is famous for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Penn, New Women and Women empowerment.
It is said that his inspiration was Bhagini's statement.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also supported the great scientist Jagdishchandra Basu.
He helped in publication and propagation of bus research through his writings and conferences.
India's special beauty is that spirituality and science are supplementary in our culture.
Bhagini's statement and scientific Jagdishchandra Basu are a strong example of this.
In 1987, there was a terrible plague in Kolkata and hundreds of people died in Jothota.
Bhagini's statement started the work of cleaning neck and roads without worrying about his health.
He was a woman who could live a comfortable life but was dedicated to the service of the poor.
Inspired by this sacrifice, people joined him in service work.
He taught the people the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
And it is written on his graveyard - Here the Reposes Sister Nevedita, which gives rest to all India, the statement of Bhagi, who dedicated to his universal India.
He has undoubtedly done this.
Today, for this great personality, there can be no other proper tribute to him that every Indian should take inspiration from his life and try to walk on the path of service himself.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children on Children's Day, celebrated on the birth anniversary of our first elder Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru Ji.
Children are the most important diamonds of building a New India - Nayak.
Your concern is true that the diseases that had come in old age and the last phase of life have been seen in children as well.
Today, it is very surprising when we hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases in the youth were lucky.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as lifestyle disorders.
One of the major reasons for this kind of disease in young age is reduction in physical activities in our lifestyle and change in our food habits.
The society and the family need to pay attention to this thing.
When they think about it, you will see that there is no need to specify anything.
There is just a need to change their habits by doing the things of small things properly, regularly and making them a habit.
I would like that the family members should try to adopt the habit of going to the open ground.
If possible, the elders of our family should also play with these children in the open.
Instead of coming up to the lift, make the children a habit of sliding down.
After dinner the whole family walks a little with the children .
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting from lifestyle disorder.
30 minutes of Yoga before going to school, see how much benefit is there.
You can do the same at home as well and the specialty of yoga is the same - it is easy, it is easy, it is accessible and I am saying simply because an adult can do it easily.
Several studies and researches are being carried out to know how effective Yoga is in controlling diabetes.
It is also being studied in AIIMS and the results that have been done so far are very incentives.
May Ayurveda and Yoga not only be the medium of treatment but also be a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, good news has come in the field of sports in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have named our country in different sports.
In Hockey, India has won the hockey of Asia Cup Hockey by playing a grand game.
Our sportspersons performed excellent performance and made India a Asia Cup champion ten years later.
Earlier, India was the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2003.
My best wishes to the entire team and helpful staff on behalf of my countrymen.
After Hockey, there have been good news for India in Badminton too.
Badmint Star Kidambi Srikanth has generated a pride in every Indian by winning the Denmark Open in his excellent performance.
This is his third super series premier title after the Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young friends for their achievements and for enhancing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under-1 World Cup was organized this month.
The teams from all over the world came to India and all showcased their greetings on the football field.
I also got the opportunity to go to a match.
The sportspersons and audience had a lot of enthusiasm.
This big occasion of the World Cup, the whole world is watching you...
Such a big match... I was shocked to see the energy and enthusiasm of all the young players to do something.
The World Cup was successfully organised and all the teams performed their best.
Though India could not win Khitab, the young sportspersons of India won the heart of everyone.
The entire world, including India, accepted this festival of sports and the entire competition was interesting and entertaining for football lovers.
The future of football is very bright and its signals are visible.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sportspersons.
My dear countrymen, the people who write to me about Swachh Bharat, I feel that if I think of justifying their feelings then I will have to programme Mann Ki Baat everyday and I will have to dedicate to Mann Ki Baat on the subject of cleanliness.
Somebody sends the fats of the efforts of the mistakes and sometimes it is a matter of collective efforts of the youth.
Somewhere there is an innovation related to cleanliness or there is news of the changes made by the people of an officer.
In the last few days, I have received a very detailed report in which the transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra is a matter of fact.
The entire team of NGs named Ecological Protection Organisation launched the Cleanliness Campaign of Chandrapur Fort.
He has sent me pictures of the fort before cleanliness and after cleanliness.
I was stunned by seeing the photographs and those who will see these photographs in their minds also feel disappointed by looking at the dirt around them. Sometimes they feel like how the dream of cleanliness will be fulfilled then I will tell them that you can see the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organization, their sweat, their zeal and their commitment in the live pictures.
Your despair will be turned into confidence as soon as you see it.
This Bhagirath effort of cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, collectivity and sustainability.
Fort is a symbol of our heritage.
The responsibility of keeping historical heritage safe and clean is for our fellow citizens.
I congratulate the Ecological Protection Organization and its entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity, and described all castes as equal.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women honour.
Guru Nanak Dev ji traveled 28 thousand kilometers on foot and during his visit, he gave a message of true humanity.
He interacted with the people, showed them the path of truth, sacrifice and commitment.
He conveyed a message of equality in the society and showed this message not only with words but with his work.
He runs a langer, which gave birth to service among the people.
With this, the feeling of unity and equality among the people was awakened.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages of meaningful life - supplicate the name of God, work, work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji had also constructed Gurubani to say his words.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th light year of Guru Nanak Devji.
Come, let us try to move forward on the path of their message and teaching.
My dear countrymen, after two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Ji on 31st October.
We all know that he laid the foundation stone of modern integral India.
Today we can learn a lot from the extraordinary journey of this great child of Mother India.
On 31st October, Smt. Indira Gandhi also left the world.
The specialty of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was that he was not only a transformative idea but also an expert in finding out a practical solution to a very complex problem to showcase it.
He had a pavement in realizing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the dryness of building India in a formula.
He ensured that millions of Indians should be brought to the shadow of One Nation and One Constitution.
Their decision-making ability enabled them to cross all the obstacles.
Whenever there was a need for humanity, he made a reputation and sacrifice, where there was a need for force.
He said that no difference between caste and creed can stop us, all of us are daughters and daughters of India, we all should love our country and build our policy on mutual love and harmony.
This statement of Sardar Saheb is still inspiring and relevant to our vision of New India.
And this is the reason why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution to making the nation an integral nation is incomparable.
Run for Unity will be organized across the country on the occasion of Sardar Sahebs Jayanti on 31st October, which will include children, youth, women and people of all age groups from across the country.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of Run for Unity - mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after the holidays of Diwali, with a new resolution, with a new determination, you all have joined your daily life once again.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar to you all.
Three years have been completed by Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani and today it is 36 mo episodes.
And when I tell you in Mann Ki Baat, people from every corner of the country reach me, perhaps I can tell you very little things but I get a lot of money.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Sometimes it is for reform in the government.
Sometimes there are individual grievances and sometimes attention is drawn to the social problem.
And I take half an hour in a month but people reach Mann Ki Baat on their thirty days.
And as a result of this, it is a simple experience of sensitivity and sensitivity in the far-flung society.
And that is why this three year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
And perhaps in such a short span of time I have got the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man of the country and I am very grateful to the countrymen for this.
And I am confident that this idea will also be useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and new energy.
Once I had said Mann Ki Baat that we should worry while eating and taking as much as we need, we should not ignore it.
However, after that I saw that I received so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organisations and many youngsters have already been doing this work.
I was very happy to note that the food that is left in the bag, the people who worked on how it should be used together, so that my mind was very satisfied and happy.
And then I saw that many people came forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie with Daughter of a Sarpanch from Haryana and I spoke to everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
However, a big campaign called Selfie with Daughter was launched not only in India but in the whole world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
This is a new self-confidence in every girl and a new pride.
Every parents felt that I too took my daughter with her.
Every girl started feeling that I have some greatness and I have some importance.
In the last few days, I had a meeting with the Tourism Department of the Government of India.
When I told the people who went to tour that wherever you go, I sent a photograph on Incredible India.
Millions of images of every corner of India, in a way the people working in the tourism sector have become a huge estate.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have experienced the huge movement that starts from the smallest of us.
Today it was heartening to say all these things because when I was thinking that three years have passed, many incidents of the last three years have been covered in my mind.
The country is constantly moving towards the right direction.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society, for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country, I have learned and learned from the countrymen in the Mann Ki Baat campaign of my three years.
This is a huge capital for any country and is a huge force.
I bow down to the countrymen with my heart.
Be it sheets, towels, curtains in the house, the experience was that the attraction of Khadi in the younger generation has increased.
Khadi sales have increased and it has led to direct employment linkages in the houses of the poor.
From 2nd October, discount is given in Khadi and many are exempted.
Once again, I would like to urge you to move forward and move the campaign of Khadi.
Let us work with the feeling of Diwali in the house of the poor by buying khadi.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And because of the increase in interest in this Khadi, the people working in the field of Khadi have also increased the enthusiasm to think in a new way among the people of Khadi in the Government of India.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring solar handlooms
The old heritage that had been closed for 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years can be revived.
In Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh, the Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several types of activities have been linked.
Many people were created new employment opportunities.
Khadi and Village Industries resumed their closed training centres in Pampore in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to give it in this area.
Now because of the resumption of this training centre, the new generation will be able to work in modern ways, work in disinvestment and build new things and I feel very good that whenever big corporate houses are also present in Diwali, then now Khadi items are being provided.
People have also started giving khadi items as gifts to each other.
We all feel how things move forward with a simple feeling.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat last month, we all had made a pledge and decided that the first 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti will celebrate Swachhta festival across the country.
We will connect people with cleanliness.
Our Honble President started this work and the country was connected.
Be it children, elderly, men or women, be it city or village, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive today.
And when I say that the Sankalp to Siddhi, how this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving towards a pledge, we are looking forward to our eyes.
Everyone accepts it, collaborates and contributes to fulfilling it.
This time, one thing is that we should clean somewhere, the other is that we should not be aware and dirty but if we want to make cleanliness a habit then a medical movement is also necessary.
This time many competitions were held with the Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in Swachhta Competition.
Thousands of children made pictures.
As far as cleanliness comes, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
We can see how much the electronic media of our country can serve the country in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Someone took my attention just a few days ago regarding the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
And you will be glad to know that the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has made Bill Dar a brand ambassador for cleanliness and when it comes to talk about the brand ambassador, you will feel that it will be a synonymous artist, perhaps it will be a portrait of the sports world.
Bill Dar himself has been in cleanliness for the last 5-6 years since the age of 12-13 years.
The biggest lake in Asia is near Srinagar where it is plastic, polythene, sused bottle and waste keeps cleaning.
They also earn a few of them.
Because his father died due to cancer at a very young age but he also linked his life with cleanliness.
I also want to congratulate the Srinagar Municipal Corporation for this initiative towards cleanliness and for their imagination of Ambassador because Srinagar is a tourist destination and every citizen of India wants to go to Srinagar and there it is a big thing to get so much emphasis on cleanliness.
And I am glad that they have not only made the Bill a brand ambassador but the Corporate has given the bill this time a car, has given a calculation and they also go to other areas to educate and motivate people for cleanliness and they lag behind till the results come.
Bill Dar is young but is a cause of inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
This month of October is a month to remember many great men for us.
These dignitaries gave us the direction for the 20th century and the 21st century, led us, guided us and suffered a lot for the country.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on October 11 and the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on September 25.
Nana ji and Deendayal ji are also the year of this century.
And what was the centre point of all these great men
One thing was common in his life and it was to live for the country, to do something for the country and not only teachings but also to guide the people through its conduct in his life.
Gandhi ji, Jaiprakash ji, Deendayal ji are all such great men who have been away from the poverty of power but have been living with the life of the people and continue to do something or the other.
Nanaji Deshmukh had left his political life in Gramodya and when we are celebrating his centenary year today, it is very natural to respect the work of his Gramodya.
Former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam ji, used to talk about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh when he spoke to the youth.
He himself went to the village to see this work of Nanaji.
Remembrance of all these great men is not beneficial for them. Remember these great men so that we can get the path ahead and get the direction forward.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely say about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but on 31st October, the run for unit, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme will be held across the country.
There should be programmes of run for units in every city and in every city of the country and this season also enjoys running and it is necessary to achieve iron power like Sardar Saheb.
And Sardar Saheb had united the country.
We should also run for unity and move forward the mantra of unity.
We say very naturally - unity in diversity, the specialty of India.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I will often tell my countrymen of India and especially to my younger generation that we are in an awakening condition.
May this feel the diversity of India, touch them, experience their aroma.
You see, these diversity of our country also works as a very big school for the development of your personality.
There is a vacation, there are days of Diwali, there is a habit of visiting everywhere in our country, people go as a tourist and it is very natural.
But sometimes there is anxiety that we do not see our country, we do not know the diversity of the country, we do not understand but we have started selecting foreign tourism by coming under the influence of the earthquake.
You go anywhere in the world, I don't have any bonds but sometimes see your home too.
The person of North India should not know what is in South India
The person of Western India should not know what is in Eastern India
Our country is full of so many diversity.
All these great men made a broader visit to India.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to know and understand India.
He tried to live in India.
Can we try to learn and understand different states, different societies, groups, their customs, their traditions, their dresses, their food and their beliefs as a student
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we not only visit but also try to join them as a student.
I have experienced myself that I must have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of India.
More than four and a half districts will be such that when I have got the opportunity to stay in the night, and today when I am taking over this responsibility in India, I feel the experience of this visit.
There is a lot of convenience in understanding things.
I also urge you to experience the immense strength of our vast India by speaking the formula of unity in diversity.
The dream of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat is included in it.
How many diversity of food is there.
Even if you keep eating a different food everyday, there will never be any repetition of food.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
Make the diversity of Kotikoti people self-confidence on the walls.
Your life will be prosperous with these experiences.
The scope of your thinking will be huge.
And who can be a great teacher from experience
Normally the period from October to March is often of tourism.
People travel.
I am confident that if you go this time too, you will take this campaign forward.
Wherever you go, share your experience, share pictures.
Definitely send your photographs on Incredible India.
Not only the buildings but also the people of that place have to meet them.
Write not only the natural beauty but also some things about the life of the people there.
Write the best essays of your journey.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can you give you any information about that
If all the people of one state say about this, then I will tell the government that it should be true and the common seven things that have come about every state should be prepared on it.
In a way, my aim is to encourage tourist destinations by the people's approach.
The Government of India will work on it.
Come on, join me.
You can also play an encouraging role in enhancing the tourism of the country using the time from October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, as a human, many things touch me too.
It inspires my heart.
It leaves a deep impact on my mind.
In the end, I am also a man like you.
We have seen a unique example of women's power and patriotism.
We can imagine that when the world has emerged at this young age then how will the state of their mind be
He worked hard and trained for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill his husband's dream.
Similarly, Nidhi Dubey's husband Mukesh Dubey used to work as a hero in the army and he was martyred for the motherland.
His wife also decided in mind and he also joined the army.
It is very natural for every countrymen to respect our mother power and our brave people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
He has created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for the Koti-Koti people of the country.
Congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, there is also a great opportunity for the youth of our country between the festival of Navratri and Diwali.
We are hosting the World Cup of FIFA Under-17.
I am confident that football will be spread all around.
The juice of every generation will increase in football.
The field of schools and colleges in India should not be such that our youngsters do not look at sports.
Let us also make sports a part of our lives when the whole world is coming to play on the earth of India.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
There is an opportunity to worship Mother Durga.
The entire atmosphere is covered with a sacred aroma.
On all sides, the atmosphere of spirituality, the atmosphere of festival, the atmosphere of devotion and the festival is celebrated as the means of power.
He is known as Shardiya Navratri.
On this auspicious festival of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen and pray to Maa Shakti that our country will achieve new heights for fulfilling the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
The country has the potential to face every challenge.
When the country moves forward at a rapid pace and 75 years of Indias independence in 2022, then the efforts to fulfill the dreams of those people who struggle for independence should be made by making a five-year rod map to achieve the resolve of those people who work hard and hard work.
My best wishes to you all.
Festivals should also be celebrated and encouraged.
Mann Ki August 2019
My dear countrymen, Madar Namaskar.
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand when violence is known from any corner of India then it is natural for the country to worry.
This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who has given full strength to the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence and equal respect.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: We have been listening to it from a childhood.
I had also said from the Red Fort that violence will not be tolerated in the name of faith, whether it is communal belief, whether it is faith in political ideas, whether it is faith in the individual.
In the Constitution which Babasaheb Ambedkar has given us, there is every kind of arrangement for justice to every person.
I would like to assure the people of the country, those who take laws and those who are waiting for violence, whether they are individuals or groups, this country will never bear it or any government will bear it.
Everyone will have to bow before the law, the law will determine the responsibility and punish the culprits.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not limited to food, lifestyle, wearing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life.
Our festivals are also rich in diversity and due to our thousands of years old cultural heritage, there should be cultural traditions, social traditions and historical traditions, there would be perhaps a few days left for 365 days, which we do not have any festival there.
Now it must have been mentioned that every festival is going on according to the timelines of nature.
There is a direct relationship with nature.
Our money festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals and first of all, I would like to call you a microbe.
Yesterday, the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in the Jain society.
In Jain society, the festival of nutrition is celebrated in the month of Bhadrava.
The last day of Purushan Parv is Sanvatsari.
This is really a wonderful tradition.
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
In a way, it is also called the forgiveness festival and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michchami Dukkadam.
Shankspeare in his drama The Merchant of Venice has written that "Mercy is two Blest, It Blesseth Hem that gives and him that he is sorry and whoever is sorry, both of them receive the blessings of God.
Bal Gangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and 125 years ago he became a symbol of the freedom movement.
And since independence, he became a symbol of social-education and social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days.
This great festival is said to be a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
Ganesh Chaturthi greetings to every countrymen.
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance.
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala.
Besides giving messages of love and harmony in the society, this festival creates new enthusiasm, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now our festivals are also becoming a cause of attraction for tourism.
And I would like to tell the countrymen that just as the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way.
Our other festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this direction.
A few days later in the series of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to every countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals are not only a symbol of faith and faith for us but also a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and cleanliness are linked to family life.
Cleanliness is the strength of preparations for festivals.
It is not a new thing for us but it is also necessary to become a social nature.
The public insistence of cleanliness should not only be in the houses but also in the entire village, in the entire city, in the entire city, in our state, in our country, in our country, in our country, in the festivals of cleanliness should be an integral part.
My dear countrymen, the definition of modernization is changing.
Recently, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how many models are your thought processes are, it is also being done to know and how much aware you are about the environment.
If it is against it then it is considered bad in the society today.
And as a result of this, today I see that in Ganesh Festival, eco-friendly Ganesha, as if a big campaign has been started.
If you go to the youth then children are making Ganesh ji in every house and they are making Ganesh ji by bringing soil.
Various types of experiments are being done in every family.
In a way, such a comprehensive training of Environment Consciousness has been seen in this Ganesh Festival which has never been seen before.
Media Houses are also training, inspiring and guiding people for the statues of eco-friendly Ganesha in large numbers.
And as I said, our country is full of crores of bright minds.
And it feels very good when some new innovations are known.
Someone told me that there is a gentleman who himself is an engineer, he collected soil in a special way and combined it and trained people to build Ganesh ji.
And if Ganesh is immersed in water then he takes water in a dollar and keeps it in it so that he gets immersed in water immediately.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will complete three years on 2nd October.
And its positive consequences are visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached from 3 to about 6.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation in the villages.
A few days ago, there was a severe flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when water was reduced after the flood situation, so much dirt was spread everywhere.
At such a time, the worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banaskantha district of Gujarat cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by floods.
Everybody sweated.
Every worker of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind gave an excellent example of unity for cleanliness.
If it becomes our sustainable nature, then where can our country reach
We can find an opportunity wherever we get the opportunity.
But we all join.
Work together on the day of holiday or Sunday .
Go to the population of Adosh-Padosh, go to the nearby village but do it as a movement.
In a sector has been built where after the construction of toilets, you can name your name and the name of the family which has helped.
Friends of my social media can run a constructive campaign and the work discussed in the virtual world can be an inspiration to be respected.
This campaign of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation from Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition is an essential competition for you, is a short film making competition, painting competition is being organized.
You can write bindings in different languages and there is no age limit, no age-limit.
You can make a short film, you can make it from your mobile.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that inspires cleanliness.
It can be a silent in any language.
The participants who will participate in the competition and the best of them who will be selected will be three at District Level and three at State Level will be awarded.
So I invite everyone to come and join you in the form of this campaign of cleanliness.
Once again, I would like to say that this time, pledge to celebrate 2nd October Gandhi Jayanti as Swachhta 2nd October and for this, take the Swachhta Mantra to every household from 15th September.
Take some steps for cleanliness.
Make yourself a participant in this effort.
You see how this 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti will shine.
You can imagine that after this 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, after the same service, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, how a sacred joy will be there in us to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I specially want to accept all of you today.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for such a long time but I would like to express my gratitude that is why I would like to accept loans because lakhs of people from every corner of the country join Mann Ki Baat programme.
The number of listeners is not only in crores but lakhs of people write to me sometimes, sometimes send messages, sometimes send messages on phones, which is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
Besides, I look forward to your messages as much as you look forward to listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Sometimes some things become a part of our habit that we don't even think we do wrong.
Prime Minister, I am speaking indecently from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my witnesses.
He always strives to help people but I am worried about a habit of this thing.
I once went to the mall to shop with him.
He spent Rs. 2000 comfortably for a sari and the autorickshaws he had taken for Pitja to go up to the mall continued to pay for a long time with the rickshaw for five rupees.
While returning we bought vegetables from the road and saved four-five rupees by repaying every vegetable .
I felt very bad.
We pay big bills without asking them once again and fight for a few rupees with our labouring brothers and sisters.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell some goods around our house, some ferry persons come to the house, some small shopkeeper or vegetable seller or some autorickshaw person, whenever we come in contact with the people living with some hard work, then we start feeling emotional with it and feelings and feelings.
And whenever we go to eat in a big restaurant, we don't even see what we have written in the bill and immediately take out the money.
Not only this, we cannot even buy saris in the shawl room but we cannot live with the poor.
Have we ever thought of what would happen in the minds of the poor
The question for this is not of Rs. 2-5, sorrows in the heart that you are the poor and that is why you have doubted its honesty.
There is no difference in your life for two to five rupees, but have you ever thought that this small habit of yours would have been a deep injury to his mind
Madam, I express my gratitude to you, you have given me a message by calling a phone that touches your heart.
I am confident that my countrymen will definitely leave if they have a habit of behaving with the poor.
My dear young friends, the entire country celebrates 2nd August as National Sports Day.
This day is the birthday of great Hockey-Plair and the magician of Hockey Major Dhyanchand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I recall this thing because I want to connect with the new generation of our country with sports.
Sports is a part of our life.
If we are counted among the young countries of the world then we should also be seen in this young sports field.
Sports i.e. physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancment, I understand what more than this .
Sports is in a way a very big herb of heart sports.
The youth of our country moves forward in sports and today in the computer era, I also want to warn that the Planning Field is more important than that of the plane station.
Please show the fifa play on the computer but sometimes in the field outside also with football.
Crickets will play on computers but the joy of playing cricket below the sky in the open field is something special.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out, the mother asked everyone when would they come back
Today, the situation is such that children start watching cartoon films in one corner as soon as they come home or get stuck on mobile games and then they have to say that when will you go out
From time to time, it was also a time when the mother used to tell the child when you will come and today it is a situation that the mother has to say that when will you go out
Youth friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal to discover and discover sports talents, where any child in the country, who is talented in the field of sports, can upload his biodeta or video on this portal.
The Ministry of Sports will provide training to the selected sportspersons.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from all over the world with this festival of sports, sports and create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I would like to share with the countrymen as an event that has touched my heart last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some girls of a very young age and some of them are born in the Himalayas.
Six daughters of our country who have never had any connection with the sea, their enthusiasm and courage inspire all of us.
These six girls will be forced to cross the sea with a small boat INS Tarini.
This campaign has been named - Navika Sagar Parikrama and it will return to India after several months after touring the entire world.
Sometimes it spends 40-40 days together in water and sometimes it spends 30-30 days in water.
Our six daughters, and this is the first event in the world with courage among the waves of the sea.
Who will be Hindustani who is not proud of our daughters.
I salute the enthusiasm of these girls and I have told them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you can read everybody, because this is a story of adventure, a spiritual stories and I will be happy to convey the words of these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we celebrate all the Teachers Day.
Former President of our country, Dr.
Radhakrishnan ji is the birthday.
He was the President, but he used to present himself as a teacher for life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was dedicated to education.
Great scientist Albert Institution had said that it is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to Haveken joy in creative expression and knowledge.
That is, awakening the joy of creative sentiment and knowledge amongst our students is the most important feature of a teacher.
When we celebrate Teachers Day this time, can we all make a pledge together
And when we talk about change in our country, the way in which the mother remembers in the family, the teacher remembers in the society.
Teachers have a very big role in change.
Sometimes there have been such incidents in the life of every teacher that their simple efforts would have succeeded in transforming the lives of someone.
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Come on, let's take this mantra with the Teach to Transform.
Namaste, Prime Minister, my name is Dr.
Anaya Awasthi.
I am a resident of Mumbai and work for the India Research Centre at Howard University.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana Financial Inclusion has been a matter of discussion not only in India but also in the world.
On August 28, 2014, this mission was launched with a dream in mind.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) campaign is going on for three years tomorrow on 28th August.
30 crore new families have been connected with it, bank accounts have been opened.
This figure is much higher than most of the countries of the world.
Today, I am very satisfied that my poor brothers and sisters sitting at the last end of the society within three years have become a part of the economy of the country, their habits have changed, they have started covering the bank, they have started saving the money, they are feeling security of the money.
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in banks.
In a way, this is the savings of the poor. These savings are their strength in the coming days.
And those whose accounts have been opened with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana have also benefited from insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana - One rupee, thirty rupees ordinary premium today gives a new confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, due to insurance of one rupee, when the poor had suffered, the life of the family was over, in a few days he got Rs. 2 lakh.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Start-up Yojana, Stand-up Yojana - be it the Dalits, the tribals, the women, the deprived youth, the youth with the intention of doing something in their own hands, the millions of youngsters got money without any guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the banks.
Not only this, everyone has also made a successful effort to provide employment to each other.
A few days ago, the people of the bank had met me, because of the Jan Dhan Yojana, not because of the insurance, how the common man has benefited due to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and many inspiring cases came up.
Today is not so much time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that such cases are MyGov.
They can also inspire new generations by introducing such people.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment have a very negative impact.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly in Assam, Ishaan India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, have faced natural disasters due to overcrowding years.
The flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Relief is being done at a comprehensive level.
My colleagues of the Cabinet are also reaching Rubaru wherever possible.
The State Governments are also making immense efforts with the help of flood victims.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and serving citizens are also making immense efforts to help the people in such a situation.
Be it Army, Air Force, National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) or paramilitary forces, all of them are connected to the people in the service of the victims.
Due to floods, life becomes very distressed.
The team of NDRF has been undertaken.
The meeting was made disaster friends and these disasters have been trained for what to do and what to do during the disaster.
Self-servicemen have been prepared and a public organization has been taught to work in a difficult situation.
Gradually, let us also make such a habit that we can combine our activities in accordance with the news of climate, so that we can avoid harm.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that more citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been so many letters related to GST and so many phone calls have been received.
And still people are expressing happiness about GST and expressing their curiosity.
And I also hear you a phone call. Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak to you from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I have heard your Chartered Accountants Day speech and I am very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax - GST was started last month in our country.
Can you tell me whether the results of the government were expected after a month or not
I would like to know your thoughts about this.
And when a poor person writes a letter to me and says that due to GST, the prices of poor people have been reduced, things have become cheaper then I am very satisfied and happy.
Now I was looking at the impact of GST on the transport sector.
Now the income of trucks has increased.
The time is decreasing to cut the gap.
Highways are free from traffic jams.
Earlier, due to various measures, most of the resources in the transport and logistics sector used to be used to maintain the work and they had to make their new godowns in every state.
However, GST which I call good and simplicity tax.
It has actually a very positive impact on our economy and has had an impact in a short span.
The speed that has been transformed, the speed that has been transformed into each other, new registrations have created a new confidence throughout the country.
And sometimes economies experts, management experts, technologists, Indias use of GST will be researched in the form of models and present it to the world.
It will become a case study for many universities in the world.
All decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre in collaboration with them.
And this is the result that every government has had the same priority that due to GST, there is no burden on the plate of the poor.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries associated with this work, to all the departments, employees of the Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new culture of honesty.
In a way, this is also a campaign for social reform.
Once again I salute crores of Indians for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is a revolution.
We have been listening to this thing since childhood and this is the reason why a non-cooperation movement started on 1st August, 120.
August, 1942, the uit India Movement was launched, which is known as the August Revolution.
And on 15th August, 14th August, the country was free.
In a way, in the month of August, several incidents related to the date of independence have been specially linked.
This year we are going to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people know that Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali had given the name of uit India.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 1942.
The way the countrymen continued to fight and tolerate the freedom struggle from 1985 to 1942, the plains of history are our inspiration to build India.
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the freedom movement of India.
This movement was committed to the entire nation for the freedom of the British rule.
This was the time when the Indian people had become a part of the uit India Movement in collaboration with every corner of the country, whether it is village, city, educated, poor, Amir or every corner of the country against the British authority.
Jan Across was at its peak.
Millions of Indians on the hockey of Mahatma Gandhi were fluttering their lives in the struggle with the mantra of death.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and sacrificed books.
The bugle of freedom was heard and came out.
May August, Mahatma Gandhi had called for the uit India Movement, but all the big leaders were dragged into jail by the British court.
And it was during that period that great men like Dr. Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan played a leading role in the country as the second generation leader.
In the non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement, there are two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 120 and 1942.
The shape of the non-cooperation movement was different and the situation of 42 was different, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of death.
This whole success was supported by the people and the power of the people.
There was a peoples resolve, a struggle, a whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I imagine that if we look forward to linking the legends of history then India's first freedom struggle was in 1985.
The freedom struggle that started in 1985 was going on in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long-term replaced the freedom struggle in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Generations have changed, but there was no dearth in the resolution.
People came and joined, went and went, went to the new ones, went to the new ones and went to the new ones and the country was making every effort to overthrow the British Sultan.
This effort from 1985 to 1942 created a situation in this movement that it reached the peak in 1942 and such a desert of leaving India that in five years the British had to go to 14.
From 185 to 1942, the five years of 1942 to 1942 came to the people of this struggle of independence, it became such a people, it became the reason for the success of the country with the success of five decisive years of achievement.
This was a decisive year for five years.
Now I want to connect you with this count.
We were free in 1947, today is 2019.
It has been about 70 years since the governments have come, the systems have been formed, the systems have changed, the development has increased and everybody has made efforts in their own way to free the country from problems.
Likewise, there was a decisive five year of achievement from 142 to 14.
I see that from 2019 to 2022, the next five years of achieving the resolve have come forward to us.
We should celebrate this 15th August of 2019 as a pledge festival and when we are 5 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that pledge into achievements.
Efforts should be made to fulfill crores of pledges.
Similarly, the five years of 1942-14 have become decisive for the country's independence and these five years can be decisive for the future of India from 2019 to 2022.
Five years later, we will celebrate 5 years of independence.
Come, let us run a great campaign of Sankalp to Siddhi from August this month.
Every Indian, social institutions, local units, schools, colleges, different organisations - take some pledges for every New India.
One such resolution that we will be able to achieve in the next five years.
Today, I am particularly online world because we cannot be anywhere, but we must be online.
I invite the online world and especially my young friends, my young friends to come forward to contribute in the creation of a New India.
Bring video, post, blocks, articles, innovative ideas using technology, all these things.
Make this Jhumbesh a mass movement.
uit India quiz for young friends will also be launched on the Narendra Modi App.
This quiz is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce them to the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you must make a comprehensive publicity and spread it.
One person does not speak there, the voice of 125 crore Indians from the Red Fort resonates.
This time too, I invite you to send me your ideas on the MYGOV or on the Narendra Modi App.
I read it myself and I will try to express it as much time as I have on August 15.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint in my 15th August speech that my speech becomes slightly long.
Whether it is successful or not.
My countrymen, I want to say one thing.
There is a socio-economy in Indias economy.
And it should never be reduced to us.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just a joyous occasion.
Our festivals and festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
But with this, our festivals have a direct connection with the economic life of the poor to the poor.
Just a few days later, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganesh Festival, then fourth moon, then Anant Chaudash, Durga Puja, Diwali, one after the other, this is the right time when there is an opportunity for economic generation for the poor.
As far as the economy is concerned, several months before Raksha Bandhan, hundreds of families have started making stakeholders in small domestic industries.
Thousands of thousands of sweets and hundreds of businesses connect with a festival.
The family of our poor brothers and sisters runs from it.
It is not just a light festival but it is not just a festival, it is a decoration of the house.
It is directly related to the poor families that make small mud lamps.
But today when I talk about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would also like to talk about the environment.
I have seen and sometimes I think that the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, the citizens aware of the environment have written letters to me.
He has urged you to talk about eco-friendly Ganesh in Ganesh Chaturthi, so that people are planning on selecting soil.
First of all, I express my gratitude to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to speak on this topic before time.
This time the public Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
Lokmanya Tilak ji inaugurated this great tradition this year is the 125th year of the public Ganesh festival.
Once again, let us recall the contributions of Lokmanya Tilak in this year of Ganesh Festival.
And again how to take the public Ganesh Festival in the direction of Tilak ji's feeling, how to strengthen the feelings and at the same time to protect the environment, the eco-friendly Ganesh, the soil-made Ganesh, will be our resolve.
And this time I have said very soon.
I am sure that you will connect with me and this will benefit from the fact that the poor artists, the poor artists, the idols that build will get employment and the poor will fill the stomach.
Let us connect our festivals with the poor, the economy of the poor, the joy of our festivals become the economic festivals of the poor and the economic joy of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to every countrymen for several festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly looking at the field of education, economic sector, social sector, sports - our daughters are rooting the name of the country, getting new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
In the last few days, our daughters have performed wonderfully in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those girls this week.
I was very good to talk to them, but I was feeling that they could not win the World Cup.
He had pressure and tension on his face too.
We have seen many such sportspersons that if Indian players fail in it then the anger of the country breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and say something like this, write a thing that causes a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters were unable to succeed in the World Cup, 125 crore Indians took the defeat on their own.
Not only that, these girls have glorified the glory of what they did.
In fact, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters, are really doing a lot to roar the name of the country.
Once again I convey my best wishes to the younger generation of the country, especially to our daughters.
My dear countrymen, once again remind me of the August Revolution, I once again remind you of August 15, I once again recall the 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a pledge and prepare a five-year roadmap for every countrymen to achieve the pledge.
We all have to take that country to new heights, reach and reach.
Let us go together, let us do something or the other.
The fate of the country will continue to be better and move forward with confidence.
My best wishes.
The weather is changing.
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant due to rains.
After the rains, there is a feeling of relief from the cold winds falling in the last few days.
And we have seen that there are many problems in life, however stress, however individual life, public life, the arrival of rains changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath Ji is celebrated in many parts of the country with great devotion and joy.
Now in some parts of the world, the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
And the poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who don't have Dr.
He must have studied Babasaheb Ambedkar, he must have seen that he used to appreciate Lord Jagannathji's temple and his traditions as it contained social justice and social harmony.
Lord Jagannathji is the god of the poor.
And very few people must have known that there is a word in English language, Jagarnaut and that means a grand chariot which no one can stop.
And it is also seen that this word has emerged with the chariot of Jagannath.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath Ji, I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen and salute Lord Jagannath Ji in the synagogues.
The diversity of India is also its specialty. The diversity of India is also the strength of India.
People of the holy month of Ramzan celebrated with Ibat with a sacred spirit.
Now Id is a festival.
My best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Id-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of virtue.
The month of sharing of happiness and the more happiness we share.
Let us together share the treasures of happiness with inspiration from these sacred festivals and move forward.
In this sacred month of Ramzan, an inspirational incident of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live there in small villages. In a way more tribal people belong to the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
In this Ramzan, the people of the village have decided to build toilets together.
And within this individual toilet, the government also gets assistance and the amount of assistance of about one lakh has been given to them.
This one lakh rupees will be spent on other facilities in your village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for changing this sacred occasion of Ramzan to the gain of society.
One of their things is very inspiring.
And the biggest thing is that he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
We know that three regions in our country are Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala which have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared ODF.
I express my gratitude to the administration, governance and people of these five states for fulfilling this work.
We are often aware that if something is to be done in the lives of a person and in the lives of a society then we have to work hard.
If our letters are bad, if we want to improve it then we have to make efforts by staying very aware for a long time.
Then the habit of body and mind changes.
The topic of cleanliness is also the same.
Such bad habits have become a part of our nature.
We have become a part of our habits.
We have to make efforts to get rid of it.
Everybody's attention must be attracted.
We have to remember good inspiring events.
And I am glad that today cleanliness is not just a government programme.
In the last few days, a great event came to my mind, which I would like to say before you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration there has taken a big job with public participation.
A 100-hour non-stop campaign.
What was the goal
Construction of 10,000 household toilets in 1 gram panchayats in a hundred hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that people and the government have successfully completed the work of constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
1 villages were ODF.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district for presenting a very inspiring example by reaching the outcome of their hard work.
These days, in Mann Ki Baat, I have been consistently calling on people and I continue to visit the Narendra Modi App, Mygov.
They keep coming on in, keep coming through letters and keep coming to Akashwani.
Shri Prakash Tripathy has recalled that on June 25, he has presented as a black era in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathy ji's democracy is commendable and democracy is not just a system but it is also a culture.
15th, 25th June was a dark night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted to jail.
The opponent voice was pressed.
Distinguished leaders of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were locked in jail.
The judicial system was also unable to escape from the shadow of that terrible form of crisis.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Todays journalists, students of the world, people working in democracy, remembering the black times, constantly trying to increase awareness towards democracy and should continue to do it.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also in jail.
When the crisis took place for one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and described the state of mind of that time in his poem.
We have to empower this heritage.
My dear countrymen, every Indian today is proud to raise his head in the world.
On 21st June, 2019, the whole world became Yogamayam.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through yoga.
Almost all the countries of the world have made this occasion of Yoga an opportunity.
People practiced Yoga on the Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea at the World Heritage Sight Machu Picture in Peru.
People participated in the presence of Afil Tower in France.
More than 4,000 people performed collective yoga in Abu Dhabi, UAE.
In Afghanistan, India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam-Salma Dam in Hairat, awaited Indias friendship with Yoga.
In small places like Singapore, 70 programmes were held and till the week, he launched the campaign.
Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organized at UN Headquarters.
UN officials, diplomats from all over the world were present here...
Once again, Yoga has worked as a World Record.
In Ahmedabad in Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have made a new world record by doing Yoga together.
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
But for the first time I was fortunate to do Yoga in the rains.
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where the menus temperature is 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Our armed forces, BSFs, ITBPs, CRPFs, CISFs have made Yoga a part of their duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share photographs of Yoga together.
Some TV channels also carried forward this.
I got a lot of photographs, some of which have been collected on the selected Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am speaking from Dr. Anil Sonar, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
Saheb, I have a question that recently in Kerala, we had heard in your statement that instead of giving gifts and flowers at different places, we should give a good reading book as memento.
You have also started this work in Gujarat during your tenure but Saheb, we have not been able to see that work in a few days.
So can we do this
We are organised by the Binkar Foundation and people are observing the habit of reading books, people are aware of reading books.
For this, I got the opportunity to go on the occasion of its launch.
And the handloom of Khadi, which will also encourage Khadi.
As far as I was in Gujarat, the same habit of all of us was made, but after coming here, my habit was lost.
But when it went to Kerala, it was remembered once again.
And I have recently started giving the following suggestions in the government.
We can gradually create a nature.
And the age of flowers is very low.
Once we took it in our hands, then we put it in our hands.
But if we give a book then it becomes a part of the house and becomes a part of the family.
Welcoming Khadi with a towel, how many poor people get help from it.
Expenditure also reduces and it is also used in the true sense.
And when I am talking about this thing, how much historical value is such things.
When I went to UK last year, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth, in London, invited me to eat.
Despite how many years have passed, Rani Elizabeth has kept the towel given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I was watching, he was urging me to touch and see.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am confident that habits do not change overnight and when we talk about it then we also have to become a victim of vaccine.
However, there will be criticism but if I continue to talk then there will be a change gradually.
My fellow countrymen, because of being the Prime Minister, there are many kinds of work.
I have to live in the files but I have a habit for me that I read some of the letters I have received every day and I get an opportunity to connect with the common man.
Different types of papers come, different types of people write letters.
These days, I got the opportunity to read a letter and I feel that I should definitely tell you about it.
In the far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife from Madurai, Arunmoji Sarvanan, he sent me a letter.
And in Chithti, he wrote that along with focusing on the study of children in my family, I thought of doing some economic activity, which will provide financial assistance to the family.
So I took the money from the bank through the Mudra Yojana and brought some goods from the market and started a small work towards supplying them.
In such a scenario, I noticed that the Government of India has created a system called Sarvement e-Marketplace.
So I searched for information about what it is, people asked about it.
Then I registered it myself.
I want to tell the countrymen that if you get an opportunity, you also visit e-GeM on the Internet.
Those who want to send something to the government, want to send small things to the government, want to send electricity bulbs, send dustbins, want to send swords, send chairs, want to send tables and sell them, they can register their name in the site.
They can write and write about the quality they have, how many they will sell, and the people of the departments of the government will have to visit the site in accordance with their duty, and it will be seen that who provides cheaper by not binding the supply quality.
And then they have to order.
So every department of the government sees the names that they register within the e-GeM.
Due to lack of middlemen, goods are very cheap.
Now this Arulmozy Madam has registered all the goods that could be provided on this website of the government.
And it is a matter of joy that the letter he wrote to me is very interesting.
He has written that once I got the money from Mudra, my business started, I gave all the information about what I could give in the e-GeM and what I would have got from the Prime Minister's Office, he has written that the Prime Minister's Office had bought two thermos from me.
And I got my bill of Rs. 1600.
This is power.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
This is Government e-Marketplace- GeM.
I would definitely like that people who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, connect them with this site more and more.
I believe that this Minimum Governance and Maximum Governance is a wonderful example and what is its goal is at least cost and at least easier efficiency and transparency.
My fellow countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga and on the other hand we are proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground related to yoga, then our dreams are to cross the horizons of far-flung respect.
A few days ago, India has shown a lot of hard work in sports and science.
Just two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Naval Satellites with Cartoset-2 Series Satellite.
And this satellite includes about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America, besides India.
And this Neno Satellite Campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of farmers, in the field of natural disasters.
A few days ago, we all must remember that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-1.
And this is the most weighted satellite in the satellite launched by India so far.
And if the news papers of our country had compared the weight of the elephant then you can imagine how big our scientists have done in the space sector.
One thousand days of the MARS Mission have been completed on 1st June.
But I am glad that the efforts of our scientists were the power to successfully finish six months and now our Mangalyaan Mission is working even after a thousand days.
Photos are being sent, information is being provided, socio-economic data is coming, it is working more than its age.
It is an important step in our scientific journey to complete one thousand days.
We are also looking at the sports sector that the interest of our youth is increasing.
Now it is seen that along with studies, our younger generation is seeing their future in sports as well and because of our sportspersons, their hard work and achievements, the name of the country is also romantic.
Recently, India has enhanced the dignity of the country by fascinating its victory in the Badminton player Kidambi Srikanth in the Indonesia Open.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him and his coach for this achievement.
T.
I had the opportunity to attend the inauguration ceremony of Synthetic Track for Usha School of Athletics, Ushaji.
Sports also play a very important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is very big in the entire personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family too, they should be given an opportunity to play.
They should take them up from the field, lock them in the room, do not compel them to study for books, they can also move forward in them, but if they have the potential and interest in sports then they should be encouraged and encouraged by the school, college, family and surrounding people.
Everyone should dream for the present Olympics.
Once again my fellow countrymen, the atmosphere of rainy season and festivals, the feeling of this Kalkhand is new.
This year's heat can never be forgotten.
Rainfall is awaiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I convey my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community, on the auspicious occasion of this holy month.
Prayer, spirituality and donor are given great importance in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have made such a tradition that today India can proud of it, we can proudly proudly proudly proud that all the sects of the world are present in India.
This is a country where people who believe in God also live and those who deny God also live, those who worship idols also live and those who oppose idol worship also live.
Every kind of ideal, every kind of worship system, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together and in the end, be it religion, sect, ideologies, traditions, give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in advancing this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I congratulate everyone.
Last time when I was talking about Mann Ki Baat, I used a word and specially told the youth to do something new, come out of the comfort zone.
Take new experiences and this is the age when life can be lived in such a way, a little risk can be taken and difficulty can be invited.
I am glad that many people have given me a talent.
Everyone showed me the zeal to speak to me individually.
Some learn drama and some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
My reading habit was almost lost.
Therefore, I decided to read this holiday.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized that how much struggle has to be fought for India's freedom, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by those who have done a lot in a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to your present generation in this regard.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters, those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men, who spent their lives in young jails, laughed and laughed at the hearts of many young fans.
And that is why today we are breathing in independent India.
One thing we must have seen that the great men who spent time in the freedom movement had done a great job of writing, studying and fulfilling the freedom struggle of India.
I had gone to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
The Cellular Jail was visited.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmathe in jail.
He was writing poems, writing on the walls.
They were closed in a small coat.
Imagine how those who are seeking freedom would have been supposed to communicate.
When I read Savarkarji's book Maji Janmathe, I was inspired to see the cellular jail from it.
There is also a light and sound show which is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India that there was no language speaker in India who had not suffered his youth in the jails of Andaman, who had been punishing black water for independence.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
I will definitely tell the younger generation of the country that what kind of atrocities had to be faced by the people for the freedom that we have achieved, how much pain they had to face, if we go to the cellular jail then it will be known.
If you also get the opportunity, you must go there in a way that is the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connecting with Nature means to build a better planet.
And who can call this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times: One must care about a world one will not see.
That is, we should take care of the world that we don't want, our duty or worry about it.
If you are very tired and open the windows of the room, open the doors, fill the fresh air in the breath then a new consciousness comes.
When this body of the Panch Mahaputas is in touch with the Panch Mahaputas, a new consciousness comes out in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have done this experience, but we don't remember it, we don't connect it to one corner, one corner.
After this, you must see that when you are connected to the natural situation, new consciousness will emerge within you and therefore, the global campaign to connect with nature on June 5 should also be our own mission.
And we are getting some benefit from the protection of the environment by our ancestors.
If we protect, our future generations will benefit.
In Vedas, the earth and the environment are considered to be the root of power.
And Atharvaveda is the biggest guiding scripture in the environment in a way and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We say there - Mata Bhumi: Sons Ahm Prithviya: The Vedas say that the purity that we have is due to our planet.
The earth is our mother and we are his sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing must be awakened that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the achievement of knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana, the three trees were undergone.
But we need to connect it with modern terms in modern words.
These days, I continue to get news from the states.
In almost every state, a big campaign for tree plantation is being carried out as soon as it rains.
Crores of trees are planted.
My dear countrymen, 21st June has now become a day known for the world.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates it.
In a very short span of time, this 21st June World Yoga Day has spread across every corner and is connecting people.
On the one hand, when many powers of division are showing their deformed faces in the world, Yoga is a great gift of India to the world.
Through Yoga, we have linked the world to a formula.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, because of lifestyle, due to running and increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a stress free life.
And it has been noticed that this situation is happening in the people of the younger age.
Yoga plays an important role in consuming medicines and passing days and living a stress-free life in such a situation.
Yoga is a guarantee for both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible through yoga if you want to experience the journey from the body, from the mind, from the body, from the thoughts and the way you travel through health.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world for Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga related competitions.
Gradually work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga and said to me that this time, three generations of the same family should do Yoga together on the third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is grandfather or younger, parents or daughter-in-law, the three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow, Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel like we had launched a selfie with the doctor campaign and had a very interesting experience.
These three generations of Yoga will surely be keen for the country and the world.
I invite you all.
We still have about three weeks for the International Yoga Week.
Let's start studying today.
I will continue to post some or the other related posts on the Twitter from June 1, and I will continue to post till June 21.
I'll share with you.
You should also propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks, spread and connect people.
In a way, this is the movement of Privative Health Care.
I invite you all to join it.
Because I had a very interesting phone call and I couldn't even think of it like this.
But I am grateful to them for the way they caught this thing.
You will also be remembered by this phone call.
Namaste Modi ji, I am Naina, from Mumbai.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
You have taken the form of a movement by taking inspiration from the valleys of Kashi for cleanliness.
Your point is true that wherever I go, the government system does the work of cleanliness but during these days, there is a festival of cleanliness in the society too.
Five days before my visit, seven days ago, ten days ago, many cleanliness programmes are organised.
The media also gives a lot of priority to such programmes and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
You can imagine how much pleasure I would have been to know and how the country is taking into account these things in a beautiful way.
During my visit, the subject of sanitation is linked. What can be a matter of greater happiness for me
The other preparations for the welcome of the Prime Minister will be, but cleanliness will be the main thing.
This is also pleasant and inspiring for any cleanliness lover.
I convey my best wishes to all those who help in cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
However, suggestions are like spreading a bit of rumour.
I don't know whether I can do it or not.
Before Modi ji visited you, who would like to invite you to tell them, what would be the level of cleanliness if you want to invite me
The idea looked very good, but I have to think.
However, it is true that the movement should be started or it would be better to give other things in the form of gifts that we should clean up such a tonne of waste and give it in gifts.
How many people can be prevented from being immunized.
The great work of humanity will be.
One thing I would like to say is that we should not consider the waste that is a wealth and a source.
Do not see it as a waste.
The Government of India has decided to launch a major mission of West Management with the help of State Governments as well as with the help of people representatives from cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities of the country will be able to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
Two types of waste will be available, one green, another blue.
There are two types of wastes - one liquid waste and the other dry waste.
If we stay in discipline, in those four thousand cities where garbage is to be planted, dry wastes should be put in blue waste and wet wastes should be put in green waste, like the wastes that are evacuated from the kitchen, vegetable skins, eggs, eggs, trees and leaves are all wet wastes and put them in green waste.
This entire activity is like that which can be used in the fields and the color of the fields is green and you will remember what waste is to be used in the green waste.
And the remaining wastes such as radio paper, cardboard, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken dubbies, rubber, metals and others will be called a kind of dry waste which has to be recycled by putting in the machine.
Just a few days ago, you must have heard a news that the Versova Beach, which is believed to be dirty in Mumbai, has become a beautiful clean silk versova beach today.
Versova Residents Volunteer (VRV) assumed its full responsibility.
I convey my best wishes to Shri Afroz Shah.
I convey my best wishes to this movement.
And the way he connected the people of the entire region and transformed them into a mass movement, it is indeed an inspirational example.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, months, whether it is printing, TV or social media, all these accounts of the present government have been going on for three years.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Prime Minister.
I see this process as a very positive indicator.
This three-year term has been assessed on every criterion.
The people of every section of the society have reviewed it.
This is an excellent process in democracy.
I clearly believe that the governments should be responsible for democracy and the people should give account of their work.
This movement is very important for a aware nation, for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as an ordinary citizen, there is a good impact on me as well as on the minds of any ordinary citizen.
Mann Ki Baat sees it as a one-sided dialogue, some people also comment on it politically, but after such a long experience, I feel that when I started Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think that Mann Ki Baat programme would make me a member of every family of India.
It seems as if I am sitting in the middle of the family and talking about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me these things by writing.
And as I said, there is an impact on my mind in the form of a common man.
Two days ago, the Honble President, the Honble Vice President, the Honble Speaker, everybody inaugurated the Mann Ki Baat, an analytical book, as a person, as a common citizen, this event will enhance me a lot of enthusiasm.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, till now whenever I met, the rains would have come to every corner of the country, the weather would have changed, the results of the examinations would have come, the start of the new life will have to be started and with the rains, innovation will have spread in an innovative happy environment.
Let us all go ahead with love and affection of nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Most of those who suggest or try to reach me are those who actually do something in their lives.
And when this thing came to mind, I felt that this suggestion was not simple, it was evident from the discourse of the experience.
I had never thought that today the youth in our country have been doing this thing for a long time.
Yes, we have been aware of the work done by some social institutions for years but the youth of my country are engaged in it.
How many have sent me a video.
There are many places where bread bank runs.
People deposit roti in this roti bank on their behalf, deposit vegetables and those who are required, they also get it from there.
It is also a matter of satisfaction for those who give it, and those who take it will never have to look down.
This is an example of how work is done with the cooperation of the society.
Today is the end of April, the last day.
On the first day of May, Gujarat and Maharashtra are the founding day.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the citizens of both the states.
Both states have made efforts to scale new heights of development and have contributed to the progress of the country.
My best wishes to these two states.
There was a time when Climate Change was considered the subject of education, discussions, but today, in our daily life, we also experience it and express it.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The warmth that falls in our country in May-June this time came to an opportunity to experience in March-April and when I was receiving the suggestions of the people about Mann Ki Baat, people have given me most of the suggestions on what should be done in this summer period.
However, everything is prevalent, it is not new, but the reminding of it at that time is very useful.
Shri Prasant Kumar Mishra and T.
S.
Many friends like Kartik have expressed concern for birds.
These friends have said that in Balkani, water should be placed on the roof and I have seen that small children of the family do this work very well.
Once they can understand why this water should be filled and then they go to see the utensils that have been kept ten times in a day whether it has water or not and it also swims whether the birds have come or not.
We feel that this sports is going on, but in reality it is a wonderful experience in the minds of the child.
You can see sometimes and sometimes with the animals and birds, this feeling also gives a new pleasure.
However, in our country, the things of life with animals and birds and nature are coloured and it is important that such efforts should be strengthened in a collective way.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Daudi Vohra was the religious leader of the society, Saidna Saheb was a hundred years old.
I had the opportunity to launch it.
He shared pulses of about 52,000 birds in every corner of the world.
He was also ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes we are so busy that printers, milky, vegetables, posters, anybody comes to our courtyard but we forget that there are days of summer, before asking them about a little water.
Young friends, I want to do some things with you too.
Sometimes I feel worried that our younger generation enjoys living in the ASHARAM itself.
Parents also take care of them in a defence state.
I am confident that some friends will definitely try and tell me too.
Would you use this time of vacation in accordance with my suggestion
It's a lice or a new experience.
Try to learn new skills.
You should never have seen, you should not have thought, you don't know, but even if you want to go there then try to go there.
New places, new experiences, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on TV or reading about it in the book or listening to it from acquaintances and feeling the same thing itself, there is a difference between them.
I would like to urge you to learn what you have inspired in this vacation, do a new experiment.
If you are positive, if you are out of comfort then do it.
We are a middle class family and a happy family.
I do not say that do it again and again, feel it once.
Whether it is time for the evening, take your football or take a volleyball or take any means of sports and reach the poor population.
You will have the pleasure of playing with those poor children, you will see, you will have the pleasure of sports that you have never met before.
And I am confident that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Many voluntary organisations continue to serve.
Search that you are also associated with the Gugal Guru and connect with such an organization for 15 days and 20 days.
But at the same time you may feel that you have done such a summer camp, you have learned the course of personality development then you should reach those people who have not got the opportunity to participate in such a camp and learn those people who have learnt without taking the money.
You can learn how development can be done.
Every individual has become busy with technology.
Community is also a culture, community is a power.
Today is the era of competition.
Sometimes it feels scared that our young generation machines are not being man-robots
Efforts to spend time with you away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi.
If there is a country full of diversity and look at it then somebody can be learned around us.
You feel like learning car drive. Do you ever want to learn auto rickshaws
You have driven a bicycle but a three-wheeler bicycle that takes people has ever been driven to run.
You will see that all these new experiments, these skills are such that will give you joy and bind your life in a pawn from which it will also take you out.
Do something out of box.
This is an opportunity to make life.
And you will continue to think that if all the examinations are completed, if we learn to go to a new stage of office then it will not be a chance.
Later, you will fall into other shocks and that is why I will tell you that if you are happy to learn magic then learn the magic of leaf.
Keep showing magic to your warriors.
I say from my experience that by looking at the world we have to learn and understand that we cannot imagine.
This will give you a lot of learning.
I would like and it is also true that when you are going, share the pictures of it.
Have you seen what new
Where did you go
You should share your experiences using Heshtag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If BHIM App is being downloaded, you will also be using it.
But refer it to others.
If you connect someone else and that new person does three transactions, if you do economic work thrice then you earn Rs. 10 for this work.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If 20 people have been given a day, you will earn 200 rupees in the evening.
Businessmen can also earn and students can also earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute to making Digital India.
You will become a watchman of New India.
So the vacation and earnings of the vacation.
In a way, it had become a symbol of VIP culture, but the experience says that the red light was on the vehicle, it was on the car, but it was entering the brain and the VIP culture was built in a mental way.
No one can claim that the red lights that have been snatched in the brain would have come out.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Well, he has expressed doubts in that phone but now this phone call shows that the common man does not like these things.
It feels to be away from it.
Namaskar ji, I am speaking to Shiva Chaube, from Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to say something about the government's ready beacon lightban.
I read a line in Newspaper in which I wrote, I was very proud to hear this at a VIP on a road and I was also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't get into the traffic jam and I don't even have to stay for anyone.
So I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you.
And in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which has been launched, our country is not only being cleaned, the charity of VIP from our roads is also being cleaned.
But we also have to try to remove it from our mind.
If we all work together, we will be able to get out.
Our concept of New India is that the importance of EPI in place of VIP in the country will increase.
And when I am saying EPI instead of VIP, I am obvious that- Every Person is Important.
Every individual has the importance, the greatness of every individual.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore Indians, if we empower 125 crore Indians, then the greatest power will be united to fulfil their great dreams.
We have to do together.
My dear countrymen, I have always been saying that we keep remembering history, our cultures and our traditions.
We get energy and inspiration from this.
This year, we are celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji.
Because of some reason, we have become so small that we think about the maximum number of centuries.
For other countries of the world, the centenary has a great significance.
But India is such an ancient nation that we have got the opportunity to celebrate thousands of years and thousands of years old memories in its destiny.
How would it happen a thousand years ago
Very few people would know that Ramanujacharyaji had fought a huge fight against the evils that had been in the society, the feelings of hindrance, the feeling of hindrance and casteism.
Through his own conduct, the society was embraced by those who were considered untouchable.
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned for the entrance of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era, a great man is born from our society to eradicate the evil of our society.
When we celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya ji, then there is strength in social unity, organisation, take inspiration from him to raise that feeling.
The Government of India is also going to release a stamp in the memory of Saint Ramanujacharya on 1st May.
I respectfully bow down to Saint Ramanujacharya ji, pay homage.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is also a different significance.
It is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
If Labour is discussed then it is very natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people will be aware that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the facilities available to the workers today.
Baba Saheb's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Baba Saheb, I talk about Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I also remember the great saints and social reformers of Karnataka of the 12th century, Jagat Guru Basweshwar ji.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit a function.
This was an occasion to dedicate the collections of his death.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Thangdi ji.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems that the world is passing through today, the competition of violence, war, destruction, weapons...
When we see this environment then the ideas of Buddha feel very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey of Buddha from the war.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated by United Nations on this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This year it is going to be held in Sri Lanka.
On this holy festival, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
There will be an opportunity to renew their memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to move forward with the same mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And especially for our neighbouring countries.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 26th March, 2019
My dear countrymen, my greetings to you all, most of the families of the country will be busy in the examination of their children.
Those whose examinations have been completed will have a slight atmosphere and where the examinations are going on, those families will still have little concern.
But at this time I will tell you that at the time of my visit, listen to the things I have done to the students in Mann Ki Baat.
At the time of the examination, you will definitely be able to work.
Today is 26th March.
26th March is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the citizen brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should move forward, develop and assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong friend of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development within the entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, this is our shared heritage.
Bangladesh's national song is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
One interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize and the British gave him the Nighthood.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had hanged Bhagat Singh ji and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru on the fence and we all knew the incident on 23rd March - the satisfaction of serving Mother India on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - there was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were fulfilled in the yagna of freedom of Mother India.
And these three heroes are still inspired by all of us.
We cannot even decorate the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
And the entire British Sultanate was afraid of these three youths.
They were in jail, they were fixed, but they were worried about how to move forward with it.
And only then it was to be hanged on 24th March, but it was given on 23rd March.
The fence was stolen, which is not usually done.
And then the British had quietly burnt their body in today's Punjab.
A few years ago, whenever I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I used to feel a kind of wave on that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever they get the opportunity, go to Punjab, go to the place of the graveyard of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the stir of freedom, its intensity and its expansion was increasing.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired many youngsters for armed revolution, just a hundred years ago, on 10th April, 1911, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom movement of India, Gandhiji Vichar and Gandhi style had been observed for the first time in Champaran.
This was a major turn in the entire movement of freedom.
In particular, in terms of the methodology of struggle, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the field Satyagraha, the movement of the workers in Ahmedabad, all of them had a great impact on Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts and style of work.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917, he gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind.
Please imagine that a person who returned to India in 1915, only two years of tenure.
Neither the country knew them, nor had their influence, nor had they started.
We can guess how hard they had to suffer at that time and how hard they had to do.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that the organisation of Mahatma Gandhis talent, the capability of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the poorest of the poor, the impending persons against the British Sultan with their behaviour, inspire, bringing them to the ground for struggle.
And therefore, in this way we feel the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if you think about Gandhi a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a matter of great study for any person who starts public life.
We can learn from him how to start public life, how much hard to do and how Gandhi had done it.
And this was the time when we heard the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent them all to the villages at that time whether they were Rajendra Babu or Acharya Kripalani ji.
Together with the people, to learn the way people were working with the color of freedom.
And the British could not understand what is the methodology of Gandhiji. The struggle also goes on, the creation also goes on and both walk together.
Gandhi knew that he had made a coin on two sides.
Conflict on one side of the coin is creation on the other.
On the one hand, on the other hand, in the constructive work, goddess himself.
There was a very unique balance in Gandhi's work style.
What is the word Satyagraha, what can be uncomfortable, what is the non-cooperation against such a big Sultanate, Gandhi had established a new idea not through words but through a successful experiment.
The desire for this transformation of millions of countrymen, the effort of this transformation is that which will give a strong foundation to the New India.
New India is neither a government programme nor a political party, nor a project.
It is a feeling that 125 crore Indians want to make a grand India together.
There is a hope in the mind of 125 crore Indians, there is a zeal, a resolution and a desire.
My dear countrymen, if we go a little away from our lives and see the activities in the society with a sense of sensitivity and try to know what is happening around us then we will be surprised to know that lakhs of people will be seen doing something for the society, for the oppressed, for the deprived, for the poor, for the sad people.
And they continue to do as they penance, as a monk servant.
Many people go to the hospital everyday and help patients.
Many people who know that they run for blood immediately .
There are many people who are hungry and worry about their food.
Our country is a multi-ratna species.
This mantra of public service is the mantra of our blood.
If we once see it as a collective, organised, then it will be known how big it is.
When it comes to New India, it is very natural to see it from a different perspective and it is welcome to democracy.
However, it is true that if 1. 25 billion countrymen decide the path to achieve their resolve, if one step goes on, then the dream of New India can be achieved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all things should be done by the budget, government projects or government funds.
If every citizen pledges that I will follow the rules of traffic, if every citizen pledges that I will fulfill my responsibilities with full authenticity and integrity. If every citizen pledges or if I do not use petrol and diesel in my life one day in a week then how big change will come.
It means that every citizen follows his civil religion, follows his duty.
This can itself be a good beginning of a New India.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
In the last few days, there was an atmosphere in our country and a large number of people became participants in digital payments and digital movement.
The demand for how transactions can be done without cash has also increased.
The poor people are also trying to learn and gradually people are moving forward to do business without cash.
Different ways of demonetisation, post-note, digital payments have been seen to grow significantly.
Since the launch of BHIM App, it has been just as much time as two and a half months but about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward with the fight against black money and corruption. Can 125 crore countrymen pledge to work for 2.5 thousand crore digital transactions in a year
We have announced in the budget.
If they want this work for 125 crore Indians then they don't need to wait for one year, they can do it in six months.
2. 5,000 crore digital transactions, if we want to fill the discount fee then we will not fill the cash, we will be able to travel in the railways, we will pay digital payments, if we buy medicines then we will make digital payments, if we run a cheap cereal shop then we will make digital arrangements.
We can do this in everyday life.
You cannot imagine but you can serve the country with this and you can become a brave soldier by fighting black money and corruption.
In the last few days, several programmes of Digidhan Mela have been held for public education.
There is a pledge to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There was also a prize scheme.
About 12. 5 lakh people have received this reward of the consumer.
70,000 people have received the reward for traders.
And everybody has made a pledge to move forward.
The Digidhan Mela will be concluded on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
After the completion of hundred days, one last is going to be a big event.
Very big droes have also been added to it.
I am confident that whatever time the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar has left us, let us propagate Bhima App.
Let us contribute to how cash behaviour is less, how to reduce the transactions from the notes.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that every time I ask people for Mann Ki Baat suggestions are suggested.
But I have seen that every time people have been insisting on the subject of cleanliness.
I would like to talk to you about my mind.
I would like to say that people must understand how important cleanliness is.
I pass through a river every day in which people throw a lot of garbage and pollutes the river.
This river comes to my house flowing from the Rispna bridge.
It has gone to the river and in many areas and many people have spoken about it, but it has not benefited.
And the good thing is that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, suggesting me and he is also telling me that he has made a lot of efforts but he has failed.
Cleanliness movement has started from Jayar.
Every individual has been involved in it positively.
He has also taken the form of a movement.
Hate towards dirt is also increasing.
Be it awareness, active partnership, movement, all have its own importance.
But the Swachhta movement is associated with habits.
This movement is a movement to change the habits, this movement is a movement to create the habits of cleanliness.
This movement can take place collectively.
The work is difficult but it has to be done.
I am confident that this feeling has awakened in the new generation of the country, in children, in the youth and this is a sign of a good result.
Today, in my Mann Ki Baat programme, I will tell all the countrymen that this message of Gayatri should be made a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat, I have been getting a lot of suggestions from the beginning and most people have expressed concern over the ruins of food.
We know that we also take more food in the family and in the collective meal celebrations.
Everything we see is taken in the bag and they cannot eat.
We cannot eat half of the plate that we fill in and keep it there.
You have ever thought how much harm we can do with the food we leave.
Have you ever thought that if we do not spoil the food then we can fill the stomach of some poor people
Though somebody continues to make efforts, sadness on this subject is a socio-economic.
There is injustice to the poor.
I am not urging too much on this subject but I want to increase awareness.
His life inspires us not to spoil food.
We should take as much as we should eat.
Look, there are similar solutions to change.
And those who are aware of the health of the body always say that keep a little empty stomach and keep a little empty plate.
We are also familiar with the word depression.
There is an estimate that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally afflicted with depression.
The problem is that there are people around us but we cannot recognize them and perhaps we are hesitant to speak openly on this subject.
Those who are suffering from depression do not speak anything because they themselves feel embarrassed about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such a disease which cannot be freed.
It requires a psychological environment and the first mantra to come out of it is that instead of depression, it requires an expression.
Talk to your friends, friends, parents, brothers and sisters and teachers about what you are feeling.
Sometimes there is solidarity and especially the students living in the hostel have a lot of problems.
Families are large and they are mixed and there is no possibility of depression.
However, I would like to tell my parents that whenever you have seen that your son or daughter or any member of the family is sitting with everyone and he says that I don't go right now, then I will come and don't come to the table.
You should understand that this is the first step towards depression.
If he does not like to stay in the group and lives in the corner alone then keep in mind that it does not happen.
This is an excellent solution.
And depression is the reason for mental and physical diseases.
Like diabetes is the host of every disease, depression also ends the capabilities of our sustainability, fighting, adventure and decision making.
Your friends, your family, your campus and your atmosphere can stop you from going to depression.
Help me with your heart, share their happiness and grief, you will feel that the pain inside you will end.
If you try to understand their sorrows and serve them, then a new self-confidence will be born in you.
By connecting with others, serving someone and serving selflessly, the twelveth of your mind will be lightened.
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very helpful in liberating from stress, liberating from pressure and traveling towards happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga and this is the third year.
Make all your preparations and celebrate Yoga festivals in a large number of lakhs.
If you have any suggestions about the third International Day of Yoga then send me through mobile application.
The songs and poetry that can be prepared about yoga should be prepared so that it can be easily understood by the people.
But along with work, women have special responsibilities.
They also take up family responsibilities and also support the family's economic responsibilities, which sometimes injustice to their newborn children.
Then the Government of India has taken a very important decision that these job-oriented women have been extended to 26 weeks during their delivery period, during their delivery, during the first 12 weeks.
There are only two or three countries in the world who are ahead of us in this regard.
If this happens then these children will grow up and become the precious security of the country.
It will also ensure the health of mothers and it will be an important decision for them.
This will benefit approximately 18 lakh women working in the Formal Sector.
The life of all these great men continues to inspire us and inspire us to realize the resolve of a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Shukal Pratipada, Year Pratipada, Nine Sanvatsar. Congratulations to all of them for this New Year.
This is a good time for the farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after the spring season.
Nine years are celebrated in different parts of the country.
Mann Ki Baat (2nd mark)
Flowers bloom.
Not only flowers, the fruits on the trees are seen shining in the sunlight.
Fruits of summer season mango also start appearing in spring .
On the other hand, the yellow flowers of mustard in the field give hope to the farmers.
The flowers of casuda indicate the arrival of Holi.
Amir Khusro has described the moments of climate change.
Amir Khusro has written:- When the flowering mustard flows, the desu flows, the coal speaks, the fears and the weather is pleasant, then the person also enjoys the full joy of this season.
Festivals of Basant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi enhance the color of happiness in human life.
In the atmosphere of love, brothers and humanity, we are going to leave Fagan in the last month and we are ready to welcome the new month.
Spring season is the combination of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for the fact that whenever I suggest for the matter of mind, there is a lot of suggestions.
Shobha Jal has written to me on the Narendra ModiApp that a lot of people are not aware of the achievements of ISRO and hence he said, "I will leave 104 satellites and give some information about the interceptor missile.
Shobha ji is extremely grateful to you that you have sacrificed the pride of India.
Whether it is to eradicate poverty, to eradicate diseases, to connect with the world, to reach out to the world, to reach out to the world, technology- science has made its place everywhere.
15th February, 2019 is a glorious day in Indias lives.
Our scientists have proudly raised Indias mirror against the world.
And we all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in a few years.
After the success of sending the Mars Mission on Mangal, ISRO has achieved a world Vikram in the field of space in the last few days.
And it is heartening to note that this is the 38th successful launch of PSLV.
It is a historic achievement not only for ISRO but for the entire India.
This Coast Efficient Space Programme of ISRO has become a wonderful all over the world and I appreciate the success of the scientists of India sent by the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important.
Carto Sat-2D is the satellite of India and will help in the planning of dragged images, resources mapping, infrastructure and development.
Especially my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water resources are there in the country, how can they be used, what should be taken care of, our new satellite Catrosat-2D will help a lot on all these topics.
We also sent some photographs as soon as our satellite went.
He has started his work.
It is also a matter of happiness for us that this entire campaign has been led by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a strong partnership of youth and women is a proud aspect of the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on behalf of the countrymen.
As much as we give these scientists to their entire team, it is as low as we can.
Shobha ji has asked another question and this is the security of India, India has achieved a great achievement in this regard.
This thing has not been discussed very much, but the attention of Shobha ji has gone on this important thing.
India has also successfully tested the ballistic interceptor missile in the field of defence.
The interception technological missile was successful in destruction of the enemy missile at a height of about 100 km from the ground during its test.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security.
And its specialty is that even if India comes from a distance of 200 kilometres, then this missile will destroy it in space itself.
Whenever we want new technologies, a new scientific achievement, we are happy.
And the curiosity has played a very big role in the development journey of human life.
And those special intelligence talents that do not allow the curiosity to remain as a curiosity, they also raise questions within them, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And this curiosity becomes the reason for new innovation.
He used to sit on foot until he got the answer.
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is not a complete break.
Full breaking is impossible.
The effort to know the laws of the universe and the minds of the humans continues to continue.
New science, new technologies are generated from it.
And every technologies give birth to a new era of every new science.
My dear young friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have told me that our younger generation should be attracted towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Todays scientific science becomes the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of generations in the future.
In the last few days, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a very unique competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Invites for social use innovation were invited.
Recognizing, displaying, informing people and how to work for the common man, how to make jungle manufacturing, how to be commercially used and I have seen how important things have been done.
Many times the problem also exhibits the importance of science for solutions.
In the year 2005, there was rain in Mumbai, there was flood in the sea and there was a lot of trouble, there was a crisis and whenever any natural calamity occurs then the first crisis comes to the poor.
Two brothers have worked with a lot of heart and have developed a house that saves those living in the house, saves those living in the house, saves them from water consumption, can also be saved from water consumption.
And our society also becomes technology-based.
The systems are also technologically based.
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our lives.
In the last few days, there was a lot of importance on Digi-Dhan.
Gradually, people are coming out of the blockage and moving towards digital transactions.
Digital transactions in India are also increasing at a rapid pace.
Especially the younger generation has started having the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I convey my best wishes to him.
In the last few days in our country, the Lucky Consumer Scheme Digidhan Business Scheme has received huge support.
It has been about two months since 15 thousand people get a reward of Rs. 1,000 per day.
And through these two schemes, an initiative to make digital payments a mass movement in India has been welcomed across the country.
And it is heartening to note that till now 10 lakh people have been awarded under the Digidhan Yojana. More than 50,000 traders have got reward and more than 1.
Under this scheme, most consumers have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of Rs. 50,000.
Be it farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, businessmen, housing, students, all participate in this scheme with enthusiasm.
From Mysore, Shriman Santosh ji has joyfully written on the Narendra Modi App that he got a reward of Rs.
But I should tell you that he has written the biggest thing.
He said that I got a reward of Rs. 1,000 and at that time I came to know that a poor old woman had been burning fire.
When the goods were burnt, I felt that the reward I have received, perhaps this poor old mother has the right to it, then I gave them thousands of rupees.
You have done a very good inspirational work.
All the time has been given the knowledge of this digital.
They keep talking so enthusiasticly and encourage others.
I would like to urge the countrymen, especially the youth of the country and the Lucky Consumer Scheme or the Digidhan Business Scheme to be the messenger of yourself.
You move forward and it is in a way anti-corruption worker.
In a way, you are the soldiers of ethics.
You know that on 14th April, the Lucky Consumer Scheme will be completed on 100 days.
It's a memorable day.
On 14th April, there will be a dro of prize worth Rs.
There are about forty and forty days left.
Can we do one thing by remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar
Recently, Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary was celebrated.
Remembering him, you should learn at least 125 people downloading the BHIM App.
Learn how transactions take place, especially to the small businessmen around you.
This time Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and Bhima App give special importance to him, so I would like to say, Dr.
This movement has been going on for the last two-three months, several townships, several villages and many cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a great contribution in the roots of the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village strengthens the economic pace of the country.
Today I would like to tell you a lot of happiness.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled the store of food.
This year, the production of record food has been done by the hard work of the farmers in our country.
Every indicator is saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time in the fields, there is such a crop that everyday it seemed that Pongal and Baisakhi are believed to be today.
This year, more than two thousand seven lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is also 8 more than the last record recorded in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I would like to thank the farmers for cultivating different pulses keeping in mind the poor of the country along with traditional crops because the poor get the highest protein from the pulses.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voice of the poor and cultivated pulses on about two and a half lakh hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service for the poor of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for the way the farmers of my country have laboured and produced records on their heads.
My countrymen, something or the other continues in the direction of cleanliness by the government, by the society, by the organisations and by everybody in this country.
In a way, everyone is looking forward to behaviouring awareness about cleanliness in some way.
And in the Varangal of the state of Telangana, there was a seminar not only in the dam room but also the importance of direct cleanliness.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad on 1-18 February.
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and the officers themselves showed that the toilets which were not used can be used and reuse.
He also showed how convenient the toilets of the new technology are and there is no discomfort, no hesitation, no psychological barrier.
And we can also clean up a toilet in the same way as cleaning the common man.
And the result of this endeavour was that through the medium of the country, it gave importance to it and it is natural that when an IAS officer himself cleanses the toilet basket, then the attention of the country is natural to go towards it.
And one of the toilet pits that we consider waste, but in terms of fertilizer, it is equal to black gold.
We can see what happens from waste to health.
And this has been proved.
A standard Twin Pit toilet for the family of six members is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be removed easily and redirected in another pit.
In six to twelve months, the waste collected in PIT becomes completely decomposed.
These decomposed wastes are very safe to handle and in terms of fertilizer, NPK is very important.
Farmers are very well aware of the NPK.
And now there is a special programme in the Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as these things will be improved.
Various departments in the government are also considered to be Swachhta Pakhwada.
In the first fortnight of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, along with the Ministry of Tribal Development, Tribal Fairs Ministry, will boost the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March, two more Ministries, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will also pursue the last two weeks Swachhta Abhiyan in March.
We know that whenever any poor citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy, self-confidence increases.
We all welcomed the exhibition that our Divyang sportspersons performed in Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup finals held in this month, India defeated Pakistan and for the second time became a world champion and enhanced the pride of the country.
We are proud of the achievements of these Divyang friends of the country.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are capable, are determined, courageous and determined.
Every time we get to learn something or the other from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
The country is moving ahead with its stature and with their achievements, the name of the country is rolling.
Our women sportspersons won the Silver Medal in the Asian Rugbi Sevens Trophy in the last few days.
My best wishes to all those players.
8th March is celebrated as World Women's Day.
In India too, there is an increase in awareness and sensitivity in the family and society to give importance to children.
Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao movement is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today, this is not just a government programme, it has become a campaign for a social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has linked the general public.
In every corner of the country, this burning issue has forced people to think and has changed the thoughts of people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When the news comes that the festival was celebrated on the birth of a child then it is very pleasant.
In a way, positive thinking towards girls is becoming a cause for social selfishness.
I have heard that under a special campaign in the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu, a ban has been imposed on child marriage.
More than 15 children have been prevented at present.
The district administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand children under the Sukanya Samriddha Yojana.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made to ensure the education of orphaned children by the district administration along with organizing the Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being run for the education of children from every village and every household under the 'Har Ghar Dashtak' programme.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire the children who had been drop-outed by running your 'Bacha Apna Vidyalaya' campaign.
It means that this movement of 'Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao' has taken several forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement.
New ideas are linked to it.
It has been moulded as per local requirements.
I consider it a good symbol when we want to celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we have the same feeling.
Women are those powerful women, they are the women of India, not more or less, they are equal officers in each of them. My dear countrymen, you get the opportunity to talk about something or the other in Mann Ki Baat at various times.
I know a lot from you.
What is going on on on the earth, what is going on in the minds of the poor and the villages reach me.
I am extremely grateful to you for your contribution.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
We have celebrated several festivals in the last few days.
Yesterday, Krishna Birth Anniversary was celebrated throughout India.
And everybody can find solutions to the present problems from the life of Krishna.
Sometimes there is a feeling of innovation in the field of picking up such stones.
And that is why when I am talking to you today, my attention goes towards two Mohans.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had used his intelligence, his duties, his capabilities and his thoughts to avoid the struggle to eradicate the war even thousands of years ago.
And Charkhadhar Mohan had chosen such a way that for the protection of human values for freedom, for the purpose of strengthening the fundamentals of personality and for the freedom, he gave such a turn to the freedom struggle that is surprising for the entire world.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of laughing in all walks of life, all these things can be learned from the message of Lord Krishna.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for a big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but also in the world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Those who gave a new turn to human history, established new virtues.
One thing has always been associated with Mahatma Gandhi, in a way it has become a part of his life.
Whenever, whenever, whenever necessary, Mahatma Gandhi was present for service.
He not only gave importance to service but also emphasized the spirituality associated with it.
We can understand this very well from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, the society, humanity and humanity were the same.
Whether it is a financing farm in Africa or a tollstoy farm or a Sabarmati Ashram or a Vardha Ashram, he put special emphasis on social development, community movement in a unique way.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to bow down to several important places associated with revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi was also focusing on organisationalism with serving.
Community Service and Community Mobilisation are the feelings that we can remove in our living life.
In fact, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No, my countrymen.
And community has its own strength.
All these programmes of Gandhi Samadh Shatabdi have collectiveness and service.
Why don't we get out of the whole fountain
If we have a football team, we will not only play football but will also work in accordance with Gandhian ideals.
We can do a lot, collect old books and divide the poor and spread knowledge.
And I believe that perhaps 130 crore Indians have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore entrepreneurs.
Be it harmony, be it harmony, be it goodwill, be it goodwill and be serving with complete dedication and it should also be done for the feeling of self-reliance and happiness.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, Dandi is a very important turning point.
I inaugurated a very modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, Dandi.
I urge you to also visit any place associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere.
Be it Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram or Vardhana Ashram or Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
And along with this, write two or four words expressing your feelings.
Several programmes, competitions and exhibitions will also be organized in the coming days.
However, one thing is very interesting in this regard, which I would like to share with you.
Venice Bienal is a well-known art programme where artists from all over the world are gathered.
This time, a very interesting exhibition related to Gandhijis memories has been held in the India Pavilion of Venice Bienal.
The pictures of Haripura were specially interesting.
You might remember that the Congress session in Haripura, Gujarat, where Subhas Chandra Bose was elected president, is also included in history.
Gandhiji wanted him to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and exhibition of his art work should be organized during the session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artefacts enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It gives a new identity to the Constitution.
And his arts have made Nandlal Bose immortal along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose visited the surrounding villages of Haripura and then made some artefacts showcasing the lives of rural India.
There was a lot of discussion in the Venice of Anamol artefacts.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope to take some pledge from all Indians.
Something should be done for the country, for the society and for some part.
And that Bapu will be a good and honest workforce. The sons of Maa Bharati, you will remember that in the last few years, we have been running the same Swachhta campaign for nearly two weeks before October.
This time the campaign will start from 11th September.
During the campaign, we will come out of our home and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdaan.
Whether it is home or street, chowk or drain, school or college, we will run a campaign for cleanliness at all public places.
This time, there is a special emphasis on plastic.
Similarly, we have to eliminate the use of single-time plastics together.
On the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Bapu this time, we will not only dedicate them to Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation stone of a new folk movement against plastic throughout the country.
I appeal to all sections of the society, to every village, to the residents of small towns, to join hands and pray that this year we will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti in a way as a free India Mata from plastic waste.
Celebrate October 2 as a special day.
On the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, it will be a special festival of Shramdaan.
All the municipalities, municipalities, district-administrative systems, rural panchayats, government-non-government systems, all the organizations, all the organizations, every citizen, everybody, I urge everyone to make proper arrangements for collection and storage of plastic waste.
I also appeal to the corporate sector that when all these plastic wastes are collected, they should come forward for proper disposal and settlement.
It can be recycled.
It can make fuel.
Similarly, we can complete the work of safe disposal of plastic waste till Diwali.
There is just a need to resolve.
There is no need to see such a thing for inspiration.
A bigger inspiration from Gandhi can be another
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit well-defined is a gem of knowledge.
Whatever we want in life can be found from it.
My contact with them has been reduced recently.
But earlier my contact was very high.
Today, I would like to touch a very important thing from a Sanskrit subscription.
And these things have been written centuries ago, but how important it is today
An excellently well-defined and it has been stated by the Vice President: Prithviya Trini Ratnani, Jalam Annam Subhashitam, Mudhai: Pathankhandesh Ratna Sangya Pradiyutetetetetetetetetetetet, water, food and well-defined in the earth are three gems.
The idols are called stones.
There is a great month of food in our culture.
Even then, the knowledge of food has also been converted into science.
Balanced and nutritious diet is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborn children, because they are the foundations of the future of our society.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once one thing was brought to my mind.
Muthibhar Dhanya has become a big movement in Nashik.
Anganwadi workers collect cereals in the days of crop loans.
These grains are used to make fresh food for children and women.
In a way, a person donating it becomes a aware citizen, a social servant.
After that, he himself becomes dedicated to this objective and becomes a sign of this movement.
All of us have heard about the food processing culture in every corner of India.
When we start feeding the child for the first time, this is done.
This is a very beautiful initiative which can be adopted anywhere.
In many states, people run their date food drive.
If there is a birthday, a good day or a memorial day in the family then the members of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food and go to schools and the family members themselves serve, feed, share their happiness and increase happiness.
An unprecedented combination of service and happiness is seen.
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and happy families are suffering from malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as the Poshan Abhiyan throughout the country.
I had never thought that I would become such a place in the hearts of the youth of our country and the world.
I had never thought how many things the youth of our country and the world are focusing on.
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch youngsters from all over the world.
And it is possible that I had gone to Bhutan just last week.
I have seen that as Prime Minister, I have got the opportunity to go from Jayar anywhere and because of the International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if someone meets and sits in the world then somebody asks me about Yoga for five-seven minutes.
Discovery has organized the programme to be broadcast in 165 countries in their language.
Today, when a global chanting on environment, global warming and climate change is going on, I am confident that this programme will help the Discovery Channel in familiarizing the world with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in the Sanskrit Yatra of India.
And people now want to know about the steps taken in the direction of climate justice and clean environment in our country.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me to shrink that Modi ji was saying that you used to speak Hindi and Beer Greels did not know Hindi, how was it possible to interact with you so fast
Or later, it has been admitted.
He asks a lot of curiosity.
Jews, there's nothing in it.
If this question is in the minds of many people then I will declare this mystery.
If you see it then it's not a mystery.
The fact is that technologies have been utilized in interaction with Beer Greens.
Together with this, a small cardless instrument was made in the ears of Beer Greece and it used to be converted into English.
As I used to speak Hindi, but it used to be associated with English and it made dialogue more easier and this is a lot of technologies.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing the Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also visit places related to nature and wildlife nature and other animals.
I have said before and I have said to you loudly that you must go to Ishaan Bharat in your life.
Your inner world will expand.
On 15th August, I had urged you all to visit at least 15 places in India in the next three years.
For the purpose of 100 percent tourism, go to 15 such places, see, study, take the family and spend some time there.
These diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Your life will expand.
Your thinking will become broad.
And believe me that there are places inside India from where you will bring new enthusiasm, new enthusiasm, new zeal and inspiration.
Your family will also feel like this.
My dear countrymen, the care and concern of the environment in India is natural.
Last month, I was fortunate to announce a tiger population in the country.
You know how many tigers are in India
A pledge was taken to express concern over the decreasing population of tigers in the world.
This pledge was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India that we achieve the goal at the earliest.
We doubled the population of tigers in 2019.
Not only tiger population in India, but also the number of bulls, reserved areas and community reserved places has increased.
When I was declaring a tiger population, I also remembered Girna Singh of Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the residence of lions in the jungle of Gir was shrinking.
Their number was decreasing.
We took one step after another in Gir.
In 2003, we decided to undertake women guards there.
Infrastructure reforms for enhancing tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about protection.
But now you will have to move ahead of defence and think about the compassion of compassion.
This is the best guidance in our scriptures.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic statement of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 183
The young saints of India, who hampered the humanity of the entire world, had left India's brightness in the world.
Swami Vivekanandaji had seen the form of India, let us inspire the capabilities that Swami Vivekananda had known to India.
Everything is inside us and come out with self-confidence.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that August 2 is celebrated as a nation sports day.
On this occasion, we are going to launch a Fit India Movement-Chust Bharat journal across the country.
My dear countrymen, I will wait for you, on 2nd August, in Fit India, in the Poshan Abhiyan in the month of September, and especially in the Swachhta Abhiyan from 11th September to 2nd October and for the complete dedicated plastic release of 2nd October.
Let us come out with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
My dear countrymen, today Mann Ki Baat is the same.
I'll meet you again.
I will wait for your suggestions and your words.
Come, let us all come together and come out to realize the dreams of Gandhiji for making a India of the dreams of freedom fighters - let us go out with the joy of freedom: happiness and distinction.
Namaskar.
On 26th January, we all celebrated our Republic Day with zeal and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
I hope that at every level, at every time, the more important rights are given, the more important obligations should also be achieved.
Only two parts of the rights and duties of India's democracy can move forward at a rapid pace.
Tomorrow is 30th January, the death anniversary of our revered Bapu.
On 30th January, we all pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country by keeping a silence of 2 minutes at 11.
As a society, as a country, on 30th January, there should be a simple feeling of paying homage for two minutes.
There should not be a couple of minutes but there should also be a reverence to collectiveness, determination and martyrs.
In our country, there is a common respect for the forces and the security forces.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my best wishes to the brave men and their families who were honoured by various gallantry awards.
The awards consist of several categories such as Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishnu Seva Medal, Vishnu Seva Medal.
I would like to urge the youth, especially the youth, and you are very active in social media.
You can do one thing this time, the brave brave men who have received this honour - find on your network, write two good sentences related to it and spread it to your friends.
When we know about their courage, valour and valour, we are surprised, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, we all were happy with the zeal and enthusiasm of 26th January, at that time our soldiers who were engaged in the service of the country in Kashmir were brave due to the avalanche.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I am constantly doing Mann Ki Baat.
January-February-March-April, all these months take place for every family.
There are examinations of one or two children at home, but the entire family is buried under the burden of examination.
So I felt that this is the true time that I should talk to the students, talk to their friends, talk to their teachers because for many years, where I have gone, whom I have met, the exams have seen the reason for a very big problem.
Family distressed, students distressed, teachers distressed, every household has a unique psychological atmosphere.
And I always feel that we should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in a very detail today.
When I announced this thing, many teachers, comrades and students sent me a message, expressed their grief and spoke about the problems and thought about it, which I wanted to talk to you today.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere cannot be happy
The question has been asked by the universe but this question will be in your mind.
Exams must be an opportunity of happiness on their own.
It should be a festival of enthusiasm and enthusiasm that has worked hard throughout the year, which has now come to show.
There are very few people for whom the examination is happy and the examination is a pressure for most people.
It is to decide that you will be happy to believe that you will consider it as pressure.
Anyone who believes in happiness will get it and the pressure that he believes will fall.
And that is why I believe that examination is a festival, exams should be taken in such a way that when festivals are held, when festivals are held then the best amongst us comes out.
The feeling of the strength of the society also takes place at the time of festival.
Normally we feel that we are very proud but if we look at the arrangements for the Kumbh Mela that runs for 40-45 days then you can see what is the Make Shift Arrangement and what is the discipline among the people
This is the strength of the festival.
Even during the exam, one should become an atmosphere of festival among the neighbours in the entire family and friends.
You will see that this pressure will be transformed into happiness.
Festival-free environment will make it strong.
And I would like to urge parents here to make the atmosphere of a festival for three-four months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to convert these three-four months every year into a festival by understanding our tradition and by understanding the environment of our family.
And that is why I will tell you that Smile More, Score More.
You must have seen that when you are happy, you see yourself relaxed, you are easily relaxed and when you are relaxed then your years old things will also be remembered.
A year ago, the entire scene of what the teacher had said in the classroom will be remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the relaxation.
If you are in tension then every door is closed, not inside and not outside.
The thought process stops, which itself becomes a burden.
It must have been seen in the examination that you remember everything. The book is remembered, the subject is remembered, the Pana Crack is remembered, the leaf is written upwards and downwards.
Why didn't you remember it, it was pressure.
But what was inside came out immediately and it came out that you were relaxed.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall memory then it is relaxation.
And I say this on the basis of my own self-confidence that if there is pressure, we forget our things and if there is a relaxation, we should never have imagined and suddenly remember such things that are very useful.
And it is not that you do not have knowledge, it is not that you do not have any information, it is not that you have not worked hard.
But when there is tension, your knowledge, your information gets buried and your tense gets over it.
And that is why it is necessary that A Happy Mind is the sector for a good mark-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we cannot see the exams in the true perspective.
It seems as if it was a question of life and death.
The exams you are going to give are the exams that you have learned throughout the year.
It's not the problem of your life.
There is no examination of how you live, how you live, how you want to live, how you want to live.
In your life, in the classroom, there must have been an opportunity to pass through a lot of crises except for the examinations.
And therefore, let us be free from the burden of exams with success and failure of life.
Our former President Dr.
A.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great inspirational example.
Any Runcha Anand ji has sent me a question: The biggest challenge I can see before education is that the education examination has been focused.
The qualities have become the most important.
This has led to a lot of competition and there has been a lot of stress in the students.
So I would like to know your thoughts about the current direction of education and its future.
Though he himself has given a reply, Raksha ji wants me to present my point here.
Marks and Marksheets are very limited use.
There is no such thing in life.
How much knowledge you have achieved, life goes on.
Whether you have tried to live with what you know or not, life is going on.
Whether you have got any sense of mission, which is your sension of action, whether there is any harmony between your mission and action or not, it leads to life.
If you believe in such things, then Marx will be behind you with a strong backdrop and you will not need to run behind the marks.
Your knowledge will work in life, skills will work, self-confidence will work, will work.
You only tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and every family person will go to him who is a family doctor.
No one of you should have asked the family doctor how many qualities he had passed.
No one has asked.
Just you felt that brother, it is very good as a doctor, you are benefiting and starting to serve him.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a big case then do you see the mark sheet of that lawyer
You see its experience, its knowledge and its successful journey.
And that is why the qualities of these qualities sometimes stop us from moving towards the right direction.
But it doesn't mean that I say that I don't just read.
We need to use it for our mischief.
I was yesterday and it is necessary to know where I am today.
Sometimes this happens and if you look at your own life closely then it will be noticed that if you fall behind the qualities, you will find a short way, you will catch a few favorite things and focus on it.
But if you focus on qualities then gradually you are shrinking yourself and you limit yourself to a certain area only to get a mark.
So, it may be possible that despite being a hunter in the examination, life is sometimes failing.
Runcha ji has also said one thing - competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
Indeed, competitors do not work to move forward, competitors to move forward, and when I say competition then it means to compete with myself.
How to be better tomorrow .
One of the special features of the lives of most successful players is that they compete.
Let us take the example of Shriman Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Friends in every field of life, when you are going to examine, think that if you can study peacefully for the first two hours then you can read three hours
S.
Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of the people.
They say that the role of the people in the examination is very important.
He has written more and more: My mother was not supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be counted.
Because mothers are aware of the future of the family and they are active and make things easier.
Once you learn to accept it, most of the problems will end there.
Everybody feels that he feels.
Volunteers and teachers are in the roots of the problem.
Acceptance opens the way for solutions to problems.
Expectations are difficult to wait.
Acknowledgement of the situation provides an opportunity to open a new path.
And therefore accept what is.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not ask a single question about his health.
Sit and do not talk about what is the situation there, how is the disease, as soon as it comes.
In the first two-four minutes the climate was lightened.
By going to a sick person, we often threaten them from illness.
I will tell the volunteers that sometimes we do the same with the children.
What happened at all that during the days of examination give the child an atmosphere of laughter .
You see, the weather will change.
A lotus phone call has come to me.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can't say my name because I had done something like that in my childhood.
And when I tried to imitate and pass, I was caught in it and because of me, many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
You must have heard that many times, don't cheat, don't steal.
I also tell you the same thing again.
Once a stealing habit occurs, there will never be a desire to learn anything in life.
Then where can you reach
Their overall creativity, such a time if you read and read the examination, you might not need a copy.
My first question is whether we can reduce the stress that arises during our exams and my second question is whether the exam looks light or not thank you.
If there is a holistic development then there is a life outside the books and it is very big.
This is the time to live and learn it too.
Someone says that I first passed all these examinations, then sweet.
So it's impossible.
The rest of the parts of the body should also get physical activity.
Have you ever thought that when all these things are in front then take a look at the sky for two moments and take a look at the trees and plants and make a little lighter.
By doing so, you will see that with a freshness you will come again in your room and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, keep it down for a while, stand out, go to the kitchen, find the things you like and eat if you get the biscuit you want.
Not only for five minutes but also take a little break.
There is no need to be closed in any room to breathe deeply.
Go down a little open sky, go to the sky, take a deep breath for five minutes and then sit down to read again.
You will feel that the body will become very light and the body will not only make the mind light .
Some people feel that we will wake up late in the night - we will read more and more.
Take as much sleep as the body needs .
It'll be fresh.
Your efficiency will increase a lot.
Whenever I hold meetings at the time of elections, my throat sometimes sits.
I came to meet a folk singer.
He came and asked me how many hours do you sleep
He gave me a herb.
Indeed, if we understand the importance of these things then we will be benefitted and you will see.
But it does not mean that just sleeping.
Otherwise, the people of your family will be despised by me.
And on the day when your marksheets will come, I will see them not only.
This is a great medicine to keep the person who plays, shines, mind, intelligence, body alert.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not let the weight of what I have said.
In the same way, I also feel the same thing as I suggest to your family and parents not to be burdened.
Remembering your resolve, keep your faith in yourself and go for examination.
My best wishes.
Make a comfort, a festival to cross every comfort.
Then there will never be a scarcity .
Take this mantra forward.
Dear countrymen, on February 2019, the Indian Coast Guard is completing forty years.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the four largest Coast Guards in the world with all 126 ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
Last year, the people of Coast Guard had taken a major campaign to clean the sea coast of our country along with their responsibilities and thousands of people joined it.
And very few people will be aware that in our country, not only men but also women are taking up their respective responsibilities on their shoulders.
The Coast Guardian is also our women officers as pilots, observers, and also handles the overcraft.
Today, when maritime security is an important topic in the world, I congratulate the Indian Coast Guard on the 40th anniversary of its maritime security.
Basant Panchami is a festival on 1st February.
Basant has been approved as the best season.
There is a queen of spring seasons .
The occasion of learning is celebrated.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color de Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
I convey my best wishes to my countrymen on this auspicious festival of Basant Panchami.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat Maa Akashwani also always fills new forms with her imagination.
Immediately after the completion of my mind since last month, he has started listening to the words of mind in regional languages.
It has received a comprehensive approval.
People are writing letters from far off places.
I congratulate Akashwani for his own inspiration.
My fellow countrymen, Namaskar. My best wishes to you all on Christmas.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
Lord Isu said that the poor are not our benefits, we want to accept that Lord Isu has not only served the poor but also described the service made by the poor, this is the true empowerment.
There is a story associated with this which is very popular.
It is said that Lord Jesus was standing near the treasury of a temple.
Several Amir people came there and they donated Adhalak.
After that a poor widow came and he gave two copper coins in the form of a donation.
If we go to see it then two copper coins are not called a very big donor.
It is very natural for the devotees present there to be curiosity.
Then Lord Isu said that this woman has donated the most because all others have donated a lot but this woman has dedicated herself to the universal donation.
Today, 25th December is also the birth anniversary of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya ji.
Malviya ji, who brought about the awareness of determination and self-confidence in the Indian people, gave a new direction to modern education.
Just two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malawiji's Tapabhoomi Banaras.
I have laid the foundation stone of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at BHU in Varanasi.
This Cancer Centre is being constructed in the entire region, not only for the people of Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand-Bihar.
Today is the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country can never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we honoured the nation with the success of the nuclear energy sector.
Whether it is a party leader or a Member of Parliament, a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji had established an ideal in every role.
I salute Atal ji on his birthday and pray to God for his good health.
I was fortunate to work with Atal ji as a worker.
Several memories with him are swimming in front of his eyes.
Today, on Christmas day, as a gift, the countrymen will get the benefit of two schemes.
On the other hand, two new schemes are going to be launched for the countrymen.
Whether it is villages or cities, educated or uneducated, what is the case, how cashless business runs, how to buy without cash, the environment of curiosity is spread all around the country.
Everyone wants to learn from each other.
In order to promote this, two new incentives schemes for the Government of India, consumers and small traders are going to be started from today to strengthen the mobile banking.
A scheme to promote consumers - Lucky Consumer Scheme and other schemes for the promotion of traders - Digidhan Trade Scheme.
Today, on 25th December, as a gift of Crimsum, 15,000 people will be rewarded with dro system and they will be filled with a reward of Rs. 1,000 each in the accounts of 15,000 people and this gift is not limited to one day of today.
One thousand rupees per day will be awarded to 15 thousand people.
In 100 days, lakhs of families will be given a gift of Rs. Crores but this reward will be entitled only when you will use mobile banking, e-banking, RuPay card, UPI, USSD, and drove on the basis of this digital payment system.
In addition, there will be a day-long dro for such consumers in a week, including rewards of lakhs and three months later, on April 14, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be a bumper dro, which will have a reward of crores.
Digidhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Traders themselves connect with this scheme and also connect customers to make their own business cashless.
Such traders will also be given separate rewards and these rewards will be in thousands.
The traders will also run their own business and they will also get rewards.
This scheme has been made by keeping every section of the society, particularly the poor and the lower middle class in the centre and therefore, those people who buy something above Rs. 50 and buy less than Rs.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of this reward.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through Feature phones, ordinary phones and also sell goods and pay rupees and every person can become the beneficiaries of this scheme.
People in rural areas can also buy and sell through AEPS and they can also win prizes.
These 30 crore people can soon become part of this prize scheme.
I am confident that my countrymen will be interested in this system and the youngsters around you will definitely be aware of it and you will be able to ask them.
Hey, even in your family there will be children studying in class 10-12, those people will also be able to learn this easily.
This is very simple. The way you have sent a vote-up message from mobile phones, this is the easier thing.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payment and how to make online payments, the awareness is increasing at a rapid pace.
In the last few days, cashless trade, non-profit trade have increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
How big is this decision, businessmen can apply it well.
Those traders who sell digital transactions, who develop online payments instead of investment in their business, have been exempted from incommunications.
Everyone has taken this mission forward in their own way.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shriman Chandrababu has appointed a committee chaired by the Vice President, which is considering several schemes in this regard.
But I have noticed that several state governments have also initiated and implemented several such schemes in their own way.
Someone told me that the Assam Government has decided to give 10 discount on digital payment of property tax and business license fees.
The branches of rural banks which will provide at least two digital transactions of 5 of their consumers in the mid-January to March will get a reward of Rs 50,000 from the government.
Until 31st March, 2019, the Government has announced a reward of Rs.
Under the 'Digital Krishi Shiromani' for farmers, the Assam Government has decided to give a reward of Rs. 5,000 to 10 farmers, which will be available to those who use completely digital payments for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers.
I convey my best wishes to the Assam Government and salute every government that has started this kind of auspiciousness.
Many institutions have also carried out several successful experiments to promote digital purchase between the poor farmers of the village.
I have come to know that GNFC-Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited has set up a thousand POS machines where fertilizers are being sold to facilitate farmers and 5 lakh fertilizer bags have been given digitally to 35 thousand farmers and this work has been done in the last two weeks and fun is that 2 increase in the sale of fertilizers in GNFC compared to the last year.
Brothers and sisters, in our economy, in our lifestyle, informal sectors are very big and most of the people have to pay wage money, labour money or wage money in cash, we are paying wages and we know that this is the reason why labourers are exploited.
Wherever they get Rs. 100, they get 80, 80, they get 50 and other healthcare facilities like insurance are also deprived of them.
But now cashless payments are going on.
Rupees are being deposited directly in the bank.
In a way, the informal sector is changing in the formal sector, the exploitation is closing, the slaughter was curtailed and it is now possible for the workers, the artisans and such ordinary people to get rid of it.
They are also entitled to the benefits of other benefits along with them.
Our country is the country of the youngest.
Technologies are easily available to us.
The countries like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youth have made a lot of progress from start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters should make this region as strong as they can with new ideas, new technologies and new technologies, as much as we can, and we should also connect the country with the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
Most of the other writers have taken note of the fact that such a good work, the work of the country's wishes, such a sacred work, however, however, however, however, new ways are being discovered for wrongdoing.
And the third phase is that in which people have supported what is happening, but along with this fight should be taken forward, corruption and black money should be destroyed.
I express my gratitude to the countrymen that they have helped me in writing all such letters.
Mr. Gurumani has written only on Mai Gov: This step to curb black money is commendable.
We are suffering from citizens but we are fighting against corruption and we are happy with the support we are giving in this fight.
We are fighting against corruption, black money, etc. like the armed forces, the same feeling that Gurumani Kebali Ji has written is emerging in every corner of the country.
We all are feeling it.
But it is also true that when people are suffering and bearing problems then what person is not suffering
The more pain you have, the more pain I feel.
But for a good goal, to achieve a higher goal, whenever it works in a good manner, the people of the country remain in the midst of these difficulties, in the midst of pain and in the midst of pain.
In reality, these people are the predecessors of change.
I also thank people for another reason that they have not only faced difficulties, but have given some people a remarkable answer, who are trying to mislead the people.
Someone spreads afwa, spelling written on a note is wrong, somebody has said, the prices of salt have increased, some people have to spread afwa, 2000 notes are to be canceled, 500 and 100 notes are to be canceled.
I also salute this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, I am feeling clear that when 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with you, nothing is impossible.
The blessings of the people become the blessings of God.
I thank the people of the country and salute them that people have participated in this great yagna of corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
There was also a comprehensive discussion in the Parliament for the political parties as well as for the political parties.
If the Parliament was going on, there would have been a good discussion.
Those who are spreading rumors are wrong that all the discounts to political parties are wrong.
Those who cannot support open corruption and black money, they have been searching for government errors all the time.
This government is for the welfare of the people.
The government is constantly trying to take the vision of the people.
On the other hand, I had said on the first day that the eighth day had said that this fight is extraordinary.
For 70 years, the possibilities that have been associated with the black business of insurgency and corruption have the strength of them.
Whenever I have decided to compete with such people, they also adopt new dimensions everyday to defeat the government.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the volunteers.
How to make it possible .
I tell her mystery.
The mystery is that I am getting all these information from the people.
The information that is available from the government system is getting many times more from the people of the country and most of us are getting success due to the awareness of ordinary citizens.
No one can imagine how much danger is being raised by the aware citizen of my country to open up such elements
And most of the information that is being received is being achieved.
I am confident that the government has given an email address for this thing that you can also send this kind of accreditation.
You can also send to My Gov.
There is also a third group of letter writers and it is also in large numbers.
He says: Modiji will not be tired, will not stop, and the harder steps he has to be filled, but once he has taken the path, he has to reach Manzil.
I express my gratitude to all those who wrote such letters because they have a kind of faith and blessings in their letters.
And there is no question to return to the blessings of 1. 25 billion Indians for the work.
We have expelled it and have made the law of a very rich Benami Property.
In the coming days, the laws will also work for themselves.
Our priority is to do whatever has to be done for the welfare of the people.
My dear countrymen, last month also in Mann Ki Baat, I had said that even among these problems, our farmers have laboured hard and broke the last year's Vikram in the environment.
This is a good sign in terms of agriculture.
Be it the labourers of this country or the farmers of this country or the youth of this country, the hard work of all these people is bringing a new color today.
In the last few days, India has depicted its name in many fields in the world's economic forum.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have improved 16 places in the Global Financial Index-2016 and the World Banks Transport Efficiency Index 2016 improved by 19 ranks.
There are many reports which have also been directed towards this direction and India is moving forward at a rapid pace.
The President, the Vice President also openly expressed his monarchy.
But in such a situation sometimes sometimes become a good thing and then the mind gets a lot of satisfaction.
There was an excellent work in the Hobala of Parliament which the attention of the country was not taken.
Brothers and sisters, Today I feel very proud and joyful to say that a bill related to Divyangjan has passed in Parliament with the campaign taken by my government.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this.
I express my gratitude to the millions of Divyangjans of the country.
Our government is committed to Divyangjan.
I have also tried to make the zumbesh more satage individually.
I mean that the Divyangjans should get their rights and respect, which they are entitled.
Our efforts and confidence were strengthened by our Divyang brothers and sisters at the time when they won four medals in Paralmipics.
He has not only enhanced the respect of the country by his victory but also surprised the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, like every citizen of the country, we can have an invaluable heritage.
Today, I am happy that after the passage of this law in the interest of Divyangjans, there will be more opportunities for jobs.
For them, the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased to 4.
The Act also provides special provisions to address the education, facilities and grievances of Divyangjans.
You can guess how sensitivity the government is for Divyangjans from the fact that in the last two years, the central government has organised 4,350 camps for Divyangjans and has distributed resources to 5,80,000 Divyang brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs.
The government has passed new laws in accordance with the feelings of the United Nations.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been information from the field of sports that has made us proud.
It is very natural to be proud of us as an Indian.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four-four categories against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were eligible for exploration.
The test dry Virat Kohli also led a good batting as well.
The Indian Cricket Team's Off-Speiner R.
ICC has declared Ashwin the best cricketer and best test cricketer of the year 2016.
My best wishes to you all and my best wishes.
In the field of Hockey, there were very good news about 15 years later.
Our junior hockey team captured the World Cup.
After fifteen years, it has come to pass that when Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Team.
Last month, our women sportspersons also made a lot of compassion.
India's women hockey team also won Asian Champions Trophy and just a few days ago, India's women hockey team won bronze in the Asia Cup competition for 18 years of age.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of the cricket and hockey team.
Last month, we all were enjoying Diwali.
Like every year, on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali at the height of the Himalayas with the soldiers and soldiers of ITBP.
He was full of emotions and not only this, the best wishes that the countrymen have sent, the security forces of the country in their happiness were a wonderful reflection.
And people have not only sent messages but they have been connected with their minds.
Someone made a video that means that almost every house had become a police station of soldiers.
And whenever I used to see those letters, I was very surprised that how many imaginations and feelings have been filled and from that only MyGov thought that a coffee table book should be made by putting some select items.
The work is going on.
With the contribution of all of you, the imagination of the feelings of the soldiers of the country and the feelings of the security forces of the country will be integrated in this book.
But the truth is, it didn't seem like this time.
This time it did not seem that there was a festival and I was not at home.
It seemed as if we were also celebrating Diwali with millions of Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the Army increases by 125 crore.
Just a while ago, I had come to meet all the Sarpanches of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
And with so much love, with so much immenseness, the Sarpanches of the villages spoke and everything touched my heart.
I urged them to go and focus on the future of those children.
Today, I am glad that all the Sarpanches from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promises made to me well and made everyone aware by visiting villages.
Just a few days ago, when the board was examined, about 95 students and students from Kashmir participated in the board examination.
The inclusion of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieve new heights of development through education, for a bright future.
I congratulate him for this enthusiasm but along with this, I congratulate his parents, his family, his teachers and all the villages Sarpanches.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked the people for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that the suggestions of all came on one side.
Everyone used to say that talk about 500 and one thousand notes in detail.
However, on 8th November, while addressing the name of the nation, I had discussed the launch of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision was not common, it is full of difficulties.
However, the more important the decision is its implementation.
And I was supposed to have to face many kinds of new problems in our common life.
And even then I had said that the decision is so big that it will take fifty days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal situation.
The diseases that we have been suffering for seventy years cannot be easy to get rid of these diseases.
I can understand your problems and phones in a good way.
However, when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to illuminate you, even though sometimes the incidents that distract your minds, you have understood this path of truth well, you have well accepted this thing of the country's interest to close the notes of five hundred and thousands.
And such a big country, such a large number of notes, billions of votes and this decision-making world is looking at it very finely, every economist is analyzing it very well, evaluating it.
The whole world is watching whether India's 1. 25 billion Indians will be able to achieve success by using problems and telephone
Perhaps there may be a question mark in the minds of the world.
India has only respect for millions of Indians and it is believed that millions of Indians will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will emerge as gold in every way, and the reason for this is the citizens of this country.
The path of this success has also been possible due to you.
Millions of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night in the central government, state governments, all the units of local governments and one lakh thirty thousand bank branches across the country.
In the midst of various types of tensions, all these people are working with a very peaceful mind to consider it as a yagna of service to the nation as an attempt to make a great change.
They don't even know when they start in the morning but they are doing everything.
And this is the reason that India will succeed in it.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank and post office are working in such a situation.
And when we talk about humanity, they look two steps ahead.
Someone told me that there was an accident of an elder brother in the ruin.
Suddenly there was a need for money.
This thing came to the notice of the local bank employees and I was very happy to know that they themselves brought money to their homes and to the elderly so that they helped in treatment.
Innumerable such cases come out everyday in TV, in media, in newspapers and in conversations.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all those who labour in this great yajna and those who labour in this great yajna.
The survival of energy is only when we cross the survival.
I remember it very well - the campaign of the Bada Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was going on and the way the employees of the bank took it on their shoulders and showed it what was not done in seventy years.
Today, once again, he has raised this challenge and I am confident that the resolve of 1. 25 billion Indians and the collective mankind of all will make this nation a new force.
They are searching for illegal ways to save their money.
The sad thing is that even in this, he has discovered the path using the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by talking about greed or temptation, by putting money in their accounts or doing some work with them.
I would like to tell such people today whether to amend or not, whether to follow the law or not, it will be your wish to see the law or what to do.
But by pleasing you don't join the lives of the poor.
You do not do anything so that the name of the poor comes on the record and when the check is done then my beloved poor will get stuck due to your sins.
And there is such a stringent law of Benami property that is being implemented in it, there will be a lot of difficulties and the government does not want our countrymen to face any problem.
My name passes Ashish.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Tirali Talko, Harda district and Madhya Pradesh.
I wish many examples in Mann Ki Baat that despite being unconstitutional, people have welcomed this tough decision for the betterment of their nation, which will increase the enthusiasm of the people and the cashless system for nation building is very important and I am with the whole country.
I am very happy that you have stopped the number of thousands and five hundreds.
I speak to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal district of Karnataka.
I would like to thank you with my heart because you had said that good days will come (Achcha Din Ayeng) but no one thought that you would make such a big decision.
Looking at the notes of five hundred and thousands, black money and corruption have been found.
Every citizen of India will never have a better day than this.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for this.
Some things are known through media, through people and through government sources, the enthusiasm to work increases a lot.
It is so joyful that it is so proud that the common man has a wonderful potential in my country.
If you go to the ground and get the opportunity to pass through this road again then you must pay the money.
And when people go there, they get there and after two-four days when they pass there, they give them the money.
This is the strength of my country which also has the spirit of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
I used to discuss 'Cha' in the elections and this thing was reached all over the world.
People from many countries of the world learnt to speak the word 'Charcha'.
But I didn't know that there was a marriage in Cha Porcha
I came to know that on 17th November, a marriage took place in Surat, which was held with Cha Cha Cha Per Church.
In Surat, Gujarat, a daughter gave her tea only to those who came to the wedding and did not spend anything else.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar, who have contributed to this fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, made them inspired.
I was watching TV when I was late at one night and I saw in the news that Dhekia Juli is a small village in Assam.
There are artisans of tea gardens and they get money every week.
What did they do if they got a note of Rs. 2,000
Four women from Adosh-Padosh gathered together and bought them all around and paid a notice of Rs. 2,000, they did not need a small note because they bought them together and decided that next week when we met, we would sit and see the accounts.
People are searching for their own ways.
And also see changes.
There was a message from the government that the people of the tea gardens of Assam are telling us that we should apply ATMs there.
See how the lives of the villages are also changing.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this campaign.
The country will get benefits in the coming days but some people have got immediate benefits.
Each municipality gets a tax rate of about 50.
But this time, due to this eight-day decision, all the people ran to deposit their old notes.
In 47 urban units, there was a tax of about Rs. 3,500 crore this year.
You will be surprised to know that 13 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the same week.
Now if that municipality has four times the money then it is natural that there will be arranging sewerage in the poor population, water supply, anganwadi will be arranged.
Several such examples are being found in which direct benefits are also visible.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong link to the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen is making his own well-being in the midst of difficulties.
Farmers have discovered roads in the midst of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority but still there are difficulties, but I am confident that if there is any problem in the farmers, if there is always an intimidation in the natural calamities, then this time too it will be an obstacle.
Small businessmen of our country, who provide employment and economic activity also increases.
In the last budget, we had made an important decision that even the small shopkeepers of the villages will be able to do their own business for twenty-four hours, no law can stop them because I was of the opinion that the poor shopkeepers of the villages should not get 24 hours if they get 24 hours.
Large initiatives have been taken to lend them from the Mudra Yojana.
Millions of rupees have been delivered to such small people through the Mudra Yojana because a large number of people do small businesses and speed up the business of billions of rupees.
However, it is natural that this decision will cause them difficulty.
You can also download the bank app in mobile phones.
You can also set up POS machines for credit cards and learn how you can do business without notice.
Technological roads are safe and quick.
I would like you to help in making this campaign a success and not only lead your change and I am confident that you can lead your change.
I am confident that you can work on the basis of this technology in the business of the entire village.
I also want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that you have suffered a lot.
There is a step on the paper and when it comes to the hands, it is different.
Sometimes there is a full pay and sometimes there is something outside and the labourers are forced to make this exploit a part of life.
With this new system, we want to snatch or your bank accounts, your wages will be deposited in your bank so that the minimum wages are followed.
Nowadays your mobile phones also work as an e-packet. You can buy money from the same mobile phones from the small shops of Adosh-Padosh.
Therefore, I urge the labour brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because in the end, I have taken such a big decision for the poor, the farmers, the labourers, the deprived and the victims of the country, which they should benefit.
Today, I would especially like to talk to the youth.
We say in the world that India is such a country with a population of 65 per cent, below 35 years of age.
Young and youngsters of my country, I know that my decision would have been liked by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you are also contributing sufficiently to pursue this thing positively.
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true friend.
We have got a wonderful opportunity to serve Maa Bharati and we have got the opportunity to take the country to an economic height.
Can you help me my youngsters
You're gonna help me, you're not gonna stop talking so much.
The experience you have in today's world, the older generation is not the same.
The elder brothers in your family may not be aware of it and even the parents, the maternal uncle and the mother may not be aware of it.
You know what the app is, you know what is online banking, you know how to book online tickets.
All these things are very common for you and you are also using it but today the country that wants to do great work is our dream of cashless society.
Hundred percent cashless society is not possible but can India start the Las Cash Society
Once we start the 'Lace Cache Society' today, the council of cashless society will not be far away and I will see your physical help in it, you will see your time and you will see your resolve.
And I am confident that you will never disappoint me because all of us who want to change the lives of the poor of India.
You are aware that today there is a lot of opportunity for digital banking or mobile banking for cashless society.
Every bank provides online facility.
The direct meaning of the vote is e-packet.
There are many types of cards available.
Under Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have Ru-Pay cards and Ru-Pay cards used after 8th date.
The poor have started using Ru-Pay cards and there has been an increase of about 300.
Like mobile phones, prepaid cards are available in banks as well.
One of the best platforms is the UPI of doing business, you can also send money, you can get money and this work is as easy as you send it to the votespace.
Saw will be an uneducated person, how to send a message to the WhatsApp today.
Not only this, technology will become so easier that there is no need for any big smartphone for this work.
Every bank has also been engaged in it and now the cost of online surcharge has also been abolished and other such cards used to be wrongly spent, it would have been seen that in the newspaper in 2-4 days every expenditure has been abolished so that the movement of the cashless society can be strengthened.
My young friends, even after all this, a whole generation is such that it is unaware of it.
And as much as I know, all of you are active in this great work.
As you have sent creative messages on WhatsApp, slogans, poems, cases, cartoons and new imaginations, and how many problems our youth have this creative power, it seems that this India is the specialty of the land that the Gita was born in the battlefield in a time when we have been passing through such a big transformation.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help and I am confident that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
You should do one thing, you should pledge from today that you will become a part of yourself for cashless society.
All the technologies that you have to spend online on your mobile phones are available.
Not only this, what is the technology for at least 10 families after removing half an hour or two hours everyday, how to use technology, how to download their bank apps and how to spend the money that has been spent in your account
How to teach shopkeepers or do business
You have voluntarily been led by this cashless society, the campaign to bring the country out of the circumambulation of these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to free black money, the campaign to free the people from problems and problems.
Once you learn how people use Ru-Pay cards, the poor will bless you.
If the ordinary citizens learn this system then they will probably get rid of all concerns and if all the youngsters of India get involved in this work then I do not believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we will be able to emerge as a new modern India in the world and you can do this through your mobile phones.
You can go to 10 houses everyday and connect 10 houses everyday.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we will be the army of this change and will continue with change.
We will move ahead with this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there is a wealthy country in the world where the youth of the world have changed the lives of that nation and it will be believed that the change that brings the changes brings the youth and those who revolution.
Kenya, she has speeded up, M-PESA used the technology of a mobile system, named M-PESA and today the entire trade in Kenya has come upon it.
This country has made a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again ask you to take this campaign forward.
I invite you to work in every school, college, university, NCC, NSS, collectively and individually.
We will take this forward.
We have got an opportunity to serve the country's best, which is not lost.
Dear brothers and sisters, today is the day of the birth anniversary of a great poet of our country, Shriman Harivansh Rai Bachan ji and today Shriman Amitab Bachan ji has given a slogan for the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It must have been seen that this century's most popular artist Amitabha ji is moving forward the Swachhta campaign very well.
It seems that the subject of cleanliness has spread in his veins and he remembered the work of cleanliness on the birth anniversary of his father.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
So his son, Shriman Amitabha ji, who is running the mission of cleanliness in his veins, has written to me using the poems of Harivansh Rai ji, Swachh Than, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, Mera Account.
I salute Harivansh Rai ji with respect.
I express my gratitude to Shriman Amitabha ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in such a way and pursuing the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your emotions, your letters, on MYGOV, on the Narendra Modi App, always connects me with you.
Now there is Mann Ki Baat at 11 o'clock, but soon after that we will start in regional languages too.
I express my gratitude to Akashwani, the new initiative that has been taken by those people who will definitely get the opportunity to connect with them where Hindi is not popular.
Thank you all very much.
Those from afar seem to be as if the second name of the Indian Janjivan Festival is also natural.
The festivals that have been traditional in India since the Vedas till date have been a festival that brings change in time.
We have seen the courage to finish the tradition of festivals from time to time and changes in festivals as per the demand of time and society have also been easily accepted.
And do it through this festival.
All these things have been covered by our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
This whole world is discussing the environment, natural destruction has become a matter of concern.
The festival tradition of India is going to strengthen the nature love and culture every person from child to child.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody has been a celebration of responsibilities.
Nowadays, we keep a holiday on Sunday, but those who are older generations, workers, fishermen etc...
That is why we had developed the tradition of keeping Raja in touch with Brahmanand and science.
Today, when we celebrate the festival of Diwali, every festival is an educational festival as we said.
One thing we all know well, go to any corner of India, come to the house of Amir, go to the huts of the poorest of the poor, go to the huts of the poorest of the poor, in the festivals of Diwali, every family gets to see the cleanliness campaign going on.
The corner of the house is cleaned.
But the demand of the time is that not only the cleanliness of our houses, the cleanliness of the entire complex, the cleanliness of the entire palace, the entire village should be cleaned.
We have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the boundaries of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated and celebrated in some form in all the countries of the world.
Many governments of the world, Parliament and rulers of the world have also started becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
Whether it is the east or the west, whether it is the developed country or the developing country, whether it is Africa or Ireland, the hustle-bustle of Diwali is visible.
You must be aware that the US Postal Service has also released Deepawali postage stamp this time.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his pictures on the tweet on the occasion of Diwali.
The UK Prime Minister organised the convocation of all the societies on the occasion of Diwali in London, he himself took care of it and perhaps U.
And what is the smoke
16 women MPs from Singapore stand outside the Parliament wearing Indian saris and these photographs have been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The festival of Diwali is being celebrated in every street of Singapore.
The Prime Minister of Australia has conveyed his greetings to the Indian community on the occasion of Diwali in different cities of Australia.
Recently, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said that I have to return soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there. I mean to say that Deepawali, this light festival is also becoming an inspiration festival to bring the world community from darkness to light.
Along with good clothes , good food , etc . on the festival of Diwali there is also a lot of smoke of cracks .
And the children, the youth are very happy.
Sometimes it does not keep in mind what is falling around .
In the days of Diwali, news of accidents, news of fire and mortality raises serious concern.
And there is a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have also gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers.
In our country, the festival of Diwali is very long.
It's not just a day.
Govardhan Puja in it, brothers and sisters say, "Benefit Pancham" and take it to the Prakash Parva of Kartiki Purnima. In a way, it continues for a long time.
At the same time, we also celebrate the festival of Diwali and prepare for Chhath Puja.
Chhath Puja festival is a very big festival in the eastern parts of India.
But one of its specialties is that it gives a very deep message to the society.
But it is said that brothers, people worship the rising sun in the world.
Chhath Puja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped .
There is a very big social message in this festival...
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali or talk about Chhath Puja, this time I would like to congratulate you all.
But there is also a special time for me.
I would like to express my gratitude especially to the countrymen.
In the events that have been taking shape in the last few months, our armed forces are looting their lives for our happiness.
The sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces on my future world continues.
And one of them was in mind to dedicate this Diwali Defence Force.
I invited the countrymen for a campaign called Message to Soulgers.
But today I would like to bow down to my head and say that there is no human being in India in whose days there is immense love for the soldiers of the country and the way it has been expressed, it gives strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine for the soldiers of the security forces as a message that enhances such courage has emerged as one of you.
Whether it is school, colleges, students, villages, poor people, businessmen, shopkeepers, politicians, sportspersons or cinematographers, those who have not given a message to the people of the country, the media has also converted this festival to the opportunity of expressing gratitude to the army.
Whether it is BSF, CRPF, Indo-Tibettam Police, Assam Rifles, Air Force, Air Force, Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all, but what kind of hardships do we visit innumerable people
I can imagine how proud this moment is for the soldiers of my country.
So many acts have come on the message to Soulgers Hashtag , in a symbolic way or what to talk .
I would like to read that Shri Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem.
Such sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message. What do we say to the Fauji family
Prime Minister of Namaskar, I speak the fascination of Shiva.
Our armed brothers are being encouraged by the message to solvers campaign launched by this Diwali.
I am from a powerful family.
My husband is also an officer of Shakkar.
My father and father-in-law, both have been officers of the armed forces.
So we are full of the entire family.
I want to say that along with the military officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also offer such sacrifices.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Army are not only on the border but also on every frontier of life.
Whether it is a natural disaster, sometimes it is a problem of law, sometimes the enemies face to face, sometimes the youth who have to show courage to return to the wrong path, our youngsters continue to work inspiring every turn of their lives by patriotism.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free of open defecation free from trees.
Now Himachal has also been formed and Kerala is going to be formed on the first November.
But how can this success be seen
Now our ITBP jawans had gone to the village in holidays on their duty.
So perhaps the village had to meet at that time and it had reached the Gram Sabha and the discussion was going on in it to build toilets.
It was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
This shame should be forgotten and look at their patriotism, it is not that he served the country only after leaving bullets on the enemies.
He fitted him and took out 75,000 rupees from his checkbook and handed him over to the Sarpanch of the village and said that those 5 houses which have not been built in the toilets, give him one thousand rupees to every family on my behalf, make 5 toilets and make the villages of all of us free from open trees.
I really want to thank the youth.
I noticed that there is no road in the far-flung forests of Kerala and that village can be reached with difficulty when it walks on foot throughout the day.
It was difficult to reach the tribal panchayat Idmalakudi there, that is, the students of engineering in the nearby urban areas were noticed that toilets were to be constructed in this village.
NCC cages, youth of NSS, engineering students, all together decided to build toilets.
The goods that were to be taken to the toilets, bricks, cements and all the goods that these youngsters took up their shoulders and walked on foot all day and went to the jungle of Pella.
He worked hard and made toilets in the village and these youngsters freed a small village in the remote jungle.
This is the reason why Kerala is getting ODF.
Gujarat has also declared all municipalities - municipalities, perhaps more than 150 open defecation free.
Ten districts have also been declared free from open trees.
Haryana is also going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on November 1 and he has decided that in a few months, the entire state will be ODF.
So far, he has completed seven districts.
Work is going on in all the states.
I have mentioned some.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens of all these states for connecting with this great work and contributing to the work of eradicating dirty darkness from the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of schemes in the government and after the first scheme, if another good scheme comes in accordance with it then one has to leave the first scheme.
However, it does not usually pay any attention to these things.
Old plans are also going on and new schemes are also going on and waiting for the upcoming plans is also being seen.
This is going on.
There is no need of kerosene to those households which have gas connections and households which have electricity.
The households who have gas connections, the households who have electricity, have been quoted from the base number and I have heard that seven or eight districts have been kerosene free in the present time.
The way he had taken up this work, I am confident that the entire state will soon become kerosene free.
And the convenience of the people will also increase. Yes, there will be trouble, there will be trouble for the middlemen, there will be trouble for the innocent.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
What should be their every thing, what should the country be
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you make a scheme, first of all remember the poor and the weak faces and then decide whether the poor people will benefit from what you are going to do or not.
You decide on the basis of this criteria.
The demand for time is that we have to satisfy the hopes of the poor of the country.
To get rid of difficulties, we have to take one step after another.
Our old thinking may not be, the society must be freed from the discrimination of daughters and daughters.
The 21st century and the darkness in the village cannot move.
And that is why the Maha Abhiyan of providing electricity to the villages has been successfully moving forward to free the villages from darkness.
Time is moving forward.
After so many years of independence, what will happen to the health of the poor mothers and the poor mothers who smoke 4000 cigarettes in a day after cooking cooked on wooden powder
These five crore families are moving ahead with success to provide a smoke free life.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable sellers, milk holders, mine shopkeepers and royalists used to be trapped in such a way.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow, 31st October, the unity of the great men of this country, who made the mantra of their lives and showed them alive.
On the one hand October 31 is the festival of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the living great man of the country's unity.
On the other hand there is also the death anniversary of Smt. Gandhi.
We should not only remember the glory of the great men but also do it.
However, the phones of one of the dignitaries of Punjab have touched me and I am speaking Jasdeep, the Prime Minister, Sir.
From Punjab, sir, you know that Sardar Patel is the birthday of 31st date.
Sardar Patel is such a feeling that he spent his entire life in connecting the country and he feels that he has succeeded and brought everyone together.
My dear countrymen, this pain is not a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done the work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
Successful efforts to bring the freedom fighter down to a flag, the great Bhagirath work done by such a great Bhagirath, salute the great man.
However, it is also a pain that Sardar Saheb lived for unity, because of his priorities of unity and because of his priorities, many people were victims of politics but never left the path of unity.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who lives for unity and on the birth anniversary of Sardar, a part of history hurts all of us.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the power of that country.
There are many languages, varieties, dresses, diets, but unity in diversity is the power of India.
The original mantra of unity is the strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb's lifestyle began with a struggle for farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sometimes many of us listen to the name of Amul.
Today, people are also familiar with every manufacturing of Amul.
But very few people might know that it was Sardar Saheb's divine vision, who had imagined the Cooperative Milk Producer Association.
And Kheda district, which was called Kera district at that time, and in 1942, he emphasized this idea.
This is a living example of how Sardar Saheb had created happiness and prosperity for today's Amul farmers.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
And on this unity day, wherever we are, remember Sardar Saheb, resolve unity.
My dear countrymen, this series of festivals of Diwali is also a festival of Kartik Purnima (Deodiwala) light festival.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings are guiding not only for the entire humanity, but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
This was the original mantra of peace, unity and harmony.
When we were at the top of the disorder of hiding, caste, high and low, Guru Nanak Dev chose brother Laloo as his colleague.
Let us also illuminate the knowledge that Guru Nanak Dev has given us, if we move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', then Guru Nanak Dev can be the best guide to us.
I also salute Guru Nanak Dev when this light festival is coming on his birthday.
My dear countrymen, once again my heartfelt congratulations to the soldiers of the country on this Diwali, this Diwali.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat Programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, we have lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri region of Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days.
I bow down to all those brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
It was sufficient to make the whole country fit.
There is also sorrow and anguish in the country and this mistake has not only happened to those families who lost their daughters, lost their brothers or their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We are proud of our army.
We have many opportunities to speak to citizens and politicians and we also speak.
But the army does not speak, the army shows valour.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir as well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the opponents of the country well.
And as soon as they have started understanding the true reality, they have moved on the path of peace by dissolving such elements from themselves.
Every parents want the schools and colleges to be completed as soon as possible, the farmers are also feeling that the crops and fruits that have been prepared will reach the markets across India.
Economic activity also works well.
And for the last few days, the work has started well.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the solutions to our problems, the path of our progress and the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to reach new heights of development.
I am confident that we will sit together and find solutions to every problem, we will find the way out and at the same time paving the best way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of that governance.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to take some steps.
And we will follow it completely.
Sometimes, the people who think about the ideas we think also present innovative ideas.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot in the social media.
From every corner of India, the feelings of every kind of people get an opportunity to understand and strengthen the strength of democracy.
In the last few days, a young man named Harsh Vardhan of class 11 was given a different idea before me.
He wrote, I was very disturbed after the Uri terrorist attack.
But there is no way to do something and what can be done by a small student like me
Out of these, I thought that how should I also work for the benefit of the country
And I pledge that I will study 3 hours a day.
We will become a good citizen to work for the country.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere of anger, at such a young age, it is a matter of great pleasure for me.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the nation's consciousness.
But you must be aware that when the 1965 war took place, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was leading us and there was such a sense of enthusiasm, anger and patriotism all over the country.
Everyone wanted something or the other to do something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastriji had made a very excellent effort to touch this feeling of the country.
And he inspired the people of the country to work for the country by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.
One more way to express patriotism between the voices of bombs and guns is for every citizen, was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
When Mahatma Gandhi was also running the freedom movement, whenever the movement was at its rapid pace and whenever there was a need for a stability in the movement, he used to make the rapidity of the movement towards creative work in the society.
All of us, the army, the people sitting in the administration, and if we contribute to the spirit of our countrymen, every citizen, this patriotic spirit, something or the other creative contribution, then our country will certainly scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartike has written to me on the Narendra Modi App that the sportspersons who had gone to Paralympics created history and showcased human emotions.
Shri Varun Vishwanath has also written on the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have done very well and you should mention this in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only these two, every individual of the country has got an emotional link to our sportspersons of Paralympics.
Perhaps the performance of paralysis and our sportspersons, the views of humanity and our vision towards Divyangs have completely changed.
There is a great strength in this event.
This time, one players, including three women from our country, participated in the paralympics.
Whenever Divyangs play in comparison to other sportspersons, physical capabilities, sports skills, all these are bigger than that.
Bhai Devendra Jhajria Bhalafank, who won the gold medal, won the gold medal again after 12 years.
The age grows at the age of 12 years and once the gold medal wins, the passion is slightly reduced.
However, Devendra explained that the condition of the body or the growth of the age could never weaken his resolve and again after 12 years he took the gold medal.
And he was not a Divyang since his birth.
He had to lose one of his own hands due to the electric rocket.
You imagine that the person who won the first gold medal at the age of 23 and won the second gold medal at the age of 35 would have done so much in his life.
Mariyappan Thangavela won the Gold in a high competition.
And Thangavelu lost his left leg at the age of only 5.
Poverty did not come under the guise of their commitment.
They neither live in big cities nor come from the middle class Amir family.
Despite passing through a complicated life at the age of 21, he also gave medals to the country in the midst of physical difficulties.
With the name of Deepa Malik of the sportsperson, the pride of honouring a variety of victories has been added.
Varun C.
Bhati won bronze medals in high length.
These medals of Paralympics are not only the greatest but in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood, in our divyang brothers and sisters, these medals have done a great job.
Our sensitivities are not only awakened but our vision of looking at this disabled person has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of how these Divyangjans have performed in the paralysis of this time.
A few days ago, the Olympics competition was held in that place.
This time it has been built.
Abdeltif Baka of Algeria broke the Vikram from a short span of 17 per cent cent to a new Vikram in the 1500 meter competition for Divyangs.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth number of Divyangjans did not get any medals as a brave competitor but they also ran in a short span of time than the winners of the Gold in the competition of ordinary runners.
Once again I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward in the direction of making a smooth scheme for paralysis and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a lot of wonderful experience in Navsari in Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
A Mega Camp of the Government of India was organised for Divyangjans and it was established a lot of worldwide events.
On that day, I also got the opportunity to dedicate a book, which has collected successful stories of some Divyangjans.
There were very inspiring incidents.
The World Record was built on the land of India and Navsari, which I consider to be important.
Within eight hours, successfully used to put the machines in the ears to listen to those who could not hear.
He got place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for all of us to set up three World Vikrams by Divyangs in a single day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on the second October, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Poojay Bapu.
And on that day I had said that cleanliness should be our nature and it should be the duty of every citizen.
On the second October, when two years are taking place, I can assure you that the awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of millions of people of the country.
And I said, "One step towards cleanliness, today we all can say that everybody has tried to move one step forward.
That is, the country has moved forward towards cleanliness.
It has also been decided that the direction is true.
Its fruits are very good and what happens in some such efforts have also been seen.
Be it bus stations, railways, schools or colleges, religious places, hospitals, hospitals, hospitals, children to elderly, villages, poor, farmers, women, all are contributing to cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive geography.
However, we still have to go a long way.
For the sake of health, for the honour of the citizens, especially for the honour of mothers and sisters, the utensils of open trees should be closed.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in the near future in the direction of getting rid of the habit of trees in the open.
Recently, when I went to Gujarat, the officials told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will achieve the goal of ODF completely on October 2nd.
I would like to introduce a scheme for the young friends, especially those who use technology today.
Everyone has the right to know what is the situation in your city of Swachhta Abhiyan and therefore the Government of India has given a telephone number- 16.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1986.
By calling these 16 numbers, you will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city but will also be able to insist on building toilets.
You must take advantage of this.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to find out the situation of sanitation related grievances and redressal of complaints.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate world to come forward.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
This Swachhta Abhiyan will not be a matter of confined to Sanskrit.
Cleanliness is not enough.
These waste fertilizers should be used and for this, the government has also started from policy duration.
Fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost-sendriya fertilizers prepared from the waste.
And let the farmers who want to go to the livelihood make this sure.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, worry about the health of the earth, the farmers who want to prevent such damages due to chemical fertilizers, if such fertilizers are required in a small quantity then the companies will give such assurance to them.
And Mr. Amitab Bachan ji is contributing a lot in this work as a brand ambassador.
I also invite the youth to develop new start-ups from Waste to Wealth to Kanchen Jhubash and develop such technologies and work in affordable and affordable production.
This year, from 25th September to 2nd October, a special event - Indosan-India Swachhta Parishad is also being held.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers from all over the country, the Mayor of the metropolitan cities, the commissioner, all of these are merely to think about cleanliness.
What can happen in technology .
What can be the economic structure
How to do public participation
How to increase employment opportunities in it
All the topics are to be discussed.
And I am seeing that new information about cleanliness is coming up.
Just one day, I read in the newspaper that students of Gujarat Technology University started a campaign to build toilets in 10 villages.
He himself worked and contributed to building about thousand toilets.
A few days ago, you might have seen that a team under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh had swimming and delivered a message of cleanliness from Devprayag to Gangasagar in Ganga.
The Government of India has also made a calendar timeline of one year in its respective departments.
Every department will focus on cleanliness for 15 days specially.
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Panchayati Raj Department and Village Development Department will work together in the coming month from 1st to 15th October to enhance cleanliness in their respective areas.
And during the last two weeks of October 16th October to 31st October, the three other departments of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing Industries and Department of Consumer Affairs will run the Safai Abhiyan in the areas which are connected with them for 15 days.
It must have been seen that the Cleanliness Campaign is also underway.
Earlier, the report of the situation of sanitation in three cities was presented before the people of the country.
Now the number of 500 cities in the country with more than one lakh population have a story and there is a belief in every city that we have lagged behind, but we will do something better next time.
Cleanliness has become an atmosphere of competition.
I hope that all of us can contribute to this campaign as much as possible.
The next October is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastriji.
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is also taking place for two years.
I continue to urge you to buy something or the other of Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
This time too, I urge every family to have some or the other thing in Khadi so that the light of Diwali can emerge in the house of the poor.
On the second day of October, as a citizen, what can we connect ourselves to the work of cleanliness
If you have a video, send a video.
If our efforts in the entire country will once again give a new strength to this movement, then a new speed will be achieved.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something or the other for the country.
And I have seen that in the past, whenever I had asked to leave the gas subsidy and the recompense that the countrymen had given, it is itself a very inspiring event in the national life of India.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and they used to donate the old sports that the families used to donate and the sports that they used to give bets to the poor areas.
Looking at the wonderful joy of watching the poor children's sports, it would be like a vehicle.
Millions of workers like me who have been working with the political thinking, the work of explaining the political thinking, the aspects of politics associated with the root of India, the thinking of those who have given their political philosophy, the ethnic centenary year of Pandit Deendayal ji, with an attempt to reward the cultural heritage of India.
Sarvajan Hitay - The principle of Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya is his contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi was also talking about the welfare of the last person.
How to get the fruits of development to the poorest of the poor
They gave a complete economic agenda to every hand, to every field, to every field, to every field in two words.
The country will focus on their birth centenary year as a poor welfare year, the attention of the governments of the society, the benefits of development to the poor. Only then can we free the country from poverty.
As a part of this, the Prime Minister's residence and the road that was known as the Rescurs Road of the British, the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay has been named Lok Kalyan Marg on the birth centenary year.
This is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the century.
My dear countrymen, the two years ago I started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi.
In this, I have been making an exemplary effort that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to cultivate those government works.
How is the human being of this country inspiring me
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Shrotaj for the way Mann Ki Baat was appreciated and the way he had blessed him.
I also express my gratitude to Akashwani, who not only broadcast these things but also made keen efforts to bring it to all the languages.
I also express my gratitude to the countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and suggested the government's doorsteps. And Akashwani made a special programme on these papers and gave a platform to the representatives of the government, to solve problems.
Therefore, Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue but a new opportunity for social transformation.
For anybody else can any other reason for satisfaction with this .
My dear countrymen, the festivals of Navratri and Durga Puja in the next week, the festival of Vijaya Dashmi, a different kind of atmosphere for the preparation of Diwali in the whole country.
It is a festival of desired worship and the unity of the society is the country's potential.
Then, whether it is Navratri or Durga Puja, how should it be the festival of worship of Shakti and worship of the unity of the society
How to celebrate the festival of human beings
And that is the means of true potential, only then can we celebrate the festival of victory together.
Come, let's take the mantra of unity.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat programme on Akashwani on 28th August, 2016
My dear countrymen, Namaskar tomorrow is the birth anniversary of the magician Dhyanchand Ji of Hockey.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand Ji and also wish to remind you of his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in hockey Gold in the 128th, 132th and 136th Olympic Games.
We also know the name of all the cricket lovers, breadmans.
He said for Dhyanchand Ji, the high scale goal line runs, Dhyanchand ji Sportsmen Spirit and a living example of patriotism.
Once during the match in Kolkata, an opponent of a team played a role in Dhyan Chand ji's head.
There were only 10 minutes left in the end of the match at that time.
And Dhyanchand ji had made three rounds in ten minutes and said that I had replaced the injury.
But I saw that at this time, everybody urged me to talk about Rio Olympics.
I see the common citizens so much intimidation towards Rio Olympics, so much awareness and pressure on the elderly people of the country or something on it, I see it positive.
Besides Cricket, there is so much love for the citizens and sports of India and there is so much awareness and so much knowledge.
Reading this message for me also became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
Please speak to girls in Mann Ki Baat on their participation in education and sports as they have made the country proud to win a medal in Rio Olympics.
Some Shriman Sachin writes that you must mention Sindhu, Sakhi and Dipa Karmakar in Mann Ki Baat this time.
These girls gave medals to us.
Our daughters once again proved that they do not descend from anyone.
One of these daughters is from North India and one is from South India and one is from East India.
Somebody is from any other corner of India.
It seems as if the daughters of the whole of India have gained pride in the name of the country.
On My Gov, the peak Thakur has written that we could perform better in the Olympics.
He has written, Honble Modi Sir, first of all congratulations for the two medals we won in Rio, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that was our performance really good
And there is no answer.
We need to cut a lot of distance in sports.
Our parents still ask to pay attention to the teachings.
Even today, sports is considered to be the pace of time in the society.
We need to change this idea.
The society needs inspiration.
Thus thousands of people have expressed this feeling.
No one can deny that we cannot exhibit our hope.
It also happened that the exhibitions that our sportspersons were performing in India and the sportspersons who were performing here could not even reach there.
And only two medals could be found in the Koshtak of the medal.
However, it is also true that despite not getting the medals, if you look at it then for the first time in many sports sportspersons of India have shown great skills.
But why can we forget that it is the first Indian girl to qualify for the Olympics and for the Olympic Finals
Something like this happened in Tennis with the combination of Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopana.
For the first time in 32 years after Usha, Lalita Babar conferred the Track Field Final.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women hockey team reached the Olympics.
The sportspersons of India will certainly be good for us.
As a number of sportspersons, Adity Ashoka, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do what we have done then we will be disappointed again.
A committee has been announced in May.
We will make a map of how we can do better.
Imagine that the state chooses one of its two sports games and plans for how they can perform excellently.
I also urge all the associations associated with the sports associations that they should also be neutralized.
And I also urge every citizen of India to send me suggestions on the Narendra Modi App that those who are interested in it.
Write to the government.
The association will discuss and bring its inputs to the government.
The State Governments will discuss and send their suggestions.
But we are fully prepared and I am confident that we have to move forward with the resolve that 65 per cent of our countrymen, who are young, will achieve a better position in the world of sports.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September is Teachers Day.
I have been spending a long time with the students on Teachers Day for many years.
But for this time I had to go to the G-20 Summit and I had to say that today I had expressed my feelings in the matter of mind.
The place of the mother in life is the same as the teacher and we have seen teachers who are more concerned about their own students.
He dedicates his life for his disciples, for his students.
Nowadays, after Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichandra ji is being discussed.
He is a sportsperson but he has presented an example of what is a good teacher.
Today I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gopichand ji for his penance, his dedication to sports and his way of enjoying the success of his students.
The contribution of teachers in our fellow lives is always felt.
The former President of India, Dr.
Sarvapalli is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji and the country considers it as a Teachers Day.
He might have reached any place in his life but he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he always used to say that good teachers are those in whose students never die.
Despite being the President's post, Dr. Radhakrishna ji lived and showed a wonderful life of the inner student living as a teacher and being a teacher's mind.
If I think, I remember a lot of things about my teachers because they were our heroes in our village.
But today I can say with joy that a teacher of me is now at the age of 70, but even today his letter comes to me every month.
That is why if I see any good letters then I feel very respectful in my mind.
It will be a pride and it is our responsibility to increase the pride of our teachers in society.
You must present your photographs with your teachers on the Narendra Modi App, if you have an inspiring thing with your teachers.
See, it is very valuable to see the contribution of teachers in the country from the point of view of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a scholar and we all want that the lives of our country, our society, our family and every individual should be inadequate.
But when we talk about Ganesh festival then it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of the public Ganesh festival is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started taking place.
Discriminatory competitions and colour competitions.
Their exhibition also highlights the issues that touch the society very artistically.
This big campaign of public education is being carried out by the Public Ganesh Festival.
Surajya is our right to be born, now we move towards Surajya, Surajya becomes our priority - can we not give a message through the public Ganesh Festival
Come, I invite you for this.
It is true that festivals are likely to be of the society.
This time many people have sent me a lot of writing Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja.
Why should not you use the idol of Ganeshji made of soil of the village pond
The statues made of POP are not unfavourable for the environment.
Conservation of the environment, protection of our rivers and streams, protection of these small animals of water from pollution in it is also a God service.
Ganesh ji is a scholar.
We should not make Ganesh ji who produces legislation.
I don't know how you will take these things but I don't just say this thing, many people say it and I have heard about many.
An unfavourable Ganesh Festival to the environment - this is also a social service.
Durga Puja has more time.
Today, let us decide the old family that makes statues.
If I buy the idol from them then they will also get employment and if these idols are made from the pond or the river soil then they will be found again in it.
My best wishes to you all on the Ganesh Festival.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be divided by Saint Upadhi on 4th September.
Madhur Teresa dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud when they have served the poor people of India who have served the poor people of India.
In the celebrations that will be held on September 4, the Government of India will also send an official delegation led by our foreign Prime Minister Sushma Swaraj.
From the saints, from the sages, from the great men, we get to learn something or the other.
Let us continue to learn something or the other, let us continue to do something better.
My dear countrymen, how big change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Janash Kit is considered to be the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect people with five state governments, for clean Ganga, for clean Ganga.
On 20th of this month, the Sarpanches of the village located on the banks of Ganga were invited in Allahabad.
The village does not allow the river Ganga to be dirty and no one came from Uttarakhand for this resolution.
Someone came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar and somebody came from Jharkhand and somebody from West Bengal.
I also congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India who have fulfilled this vision. I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the five states who have taken an important step in the cleaning of the Ganga by connecting the Janshakti.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and those who are imagined by them also have a special respect in my mind.
On 15th July, more than seventy-seven students from Kabirdham district in Chhattisgarh collectively wrote letters to their parents.
This work was done by children from seven to seven years of age.
Congratulations to the students who have made this effort and special congratulations to the parents who decided to take the letter of their children seriously to make toilets.
There are similar things that inspire us.
A sixteen-year-old daughter Mallamma in Koppal district of Karnataka respected Satyagraha against her family.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a pledge.
Some Indians have made it their goal.
However, everybody is associated with it in some form and everybody is contributing to it.
Everyday news comes about how new efforts are being made.
There has been an idea in the Government of India and the people have called upon you to make a film of two minutes, three minutes and send this short film to the Government of India.
You will find details on the website.
The competition will be held and the winner will be rewarded on Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October.
I also exhort the Channelmen to compete with you by calling for such films.
Creativeness - creativity can also give a strength to the Swachhta Abhiyan.
New ways will be found, new inspiration will be found and all this will be done by the common artists with the participation of the people.
It is not necessary that there should be a big studio, good camera to make films.
A very important thing happened in the last few days.
Our Honble President Pranab Mukherjee launched a new programme in Kolkata - Akashwani Maitri Channel - will some people now have to inaugurate a radio channel
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
On the other hand, Akashwani Mitra and on the other hand Bangladeshi Betar will share each others content and Bangladeshi people from both sides will enjoy Akashwani.
I also thank Bangladesh that he joined us for this work.
I also congratulate the Akashwani friends that they are contributing in foreign policy.
My dear countrymen, even if you have given me the work of the Prime Minister, I am also like you.
And sometimes the emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy and inspire new inspirations, which inspire the people of the news to do something or the other.
In the past, I got a letter that touched my mind.
This letter was written to me by a mother who was a retired teacher of about 84 years.
If he had never forbidden me to declare his name in this letter, I would have spoken to him today.
In the letter, he wrote that whenever you appealed to leave the gas subsidy, I left the subsidy and then I forgot.
My countrymen, you must be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who have left the gas subsidy and some of my delegates should go and write a letter.
I am trying to write letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing good work, it is the best to free the poor mothers from the smoke of the smoke and I am a retired teacher.
The question is not of Rs. 50,000 but it is of the feeling of the mother and it is the blessings of the mother Kotikoti who gives confidence and strength to the future of my country.
I salute the mother and also salute the Kotikoti mothers of India who always wish someone by suffering their own lives.
My dear countrymen, last year we were in trouble due to drought but this month of August was constantly filled with floods.
There were floods in some parts of the country.
The state governments were able to do as much as the central government, the units of the local self-interest organisations, the social institutions and the citizens.
But among these flood news, there were also some reports that needed to be remembered more.
This year will be remembered in the month of August for what is the strength of unity and how big results can be achieved together.
In August 2016, a lot of opposition parties, parties who have not left a single opportunity against each other and almost 70 parties from all over the country, many parties from Parliament, all these political parties together passed the GST Bill.
Similarly, whatever happened in Kashmir, in the context of Kashmir, all the political parties of the country spoke about Kashmir in one voice.
If it is spoken in the least words, I will say that unity and mother - these two things have been in the original mantra and all of us have the opinion of 125 crore people, from the sarpanch to the elderly, from the sarpanch of the village to the elderly, it is the opinion of anyone who dies in Kashmir, whether he is a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is our people, it is our country that those people who are trying to create peace in Kashmir, sometimes they will have to answer the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to bind the country full of diversity into the bonds of unity that only then will the country be able to create a bright future.
I believe in the potential of millions of Indians.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Today morning, I got the opportunity to spend some time with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will fill every young man with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days the greatest sports event is going to be held in the world.
The word Rio will repeat in our ears.
The whole world will be playing.
You will also keep an eye on the performance of every country in the world.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much but those who have gone to play in Rio are the work of enhancing the enthusiasm of the sportspersons.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India organised Run for Rio, Khelo and Jio, Khelo and Khelo.
In the coming days, wherever we are, somebody should be able to promote our sportspersons.
There is so much fun of food, but everything has to be left.
Even if sweet sleep comes in the winter, one has to leave the bed and participate in the field and not only players but also his parents.
Sportspersons don't become night and night.
I am also ready to do this work on behalf of you.
These sportspersons are ready to become the countrys leading postman to deliver your messages.
Come, let us make every sportsperson proud in the days to come, let us increase their efforts.
And today, when I am talking about Rio Olympics, a poet lover, Punjab Central University student Suraj Prakash Upadhyay has sent a poem.
There may be many other poets who would have sent poems, maybe they would write poems, maybe they would be true.
Everyday, technology keeps changing, adopts new forms everyday, creates new effects everyday, it keeps changing.
You can't catch technology.
If there is no research and innovation then the way water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a forceful.
And if we continue to live without research and innovation, then we will become out of the world in the changing era and therefore in the new generation we will have to create an attraction to science, research and innovation in technology.
Atal Innovation Mission is being promoted by NITI Aayog.
One goal is to create an eco-system across the country through Atal Innovation Mission, innovation, experiment, enterprise, this sequence is going on and thereby enhancing employment opportunities.
Similarly, the Incubation Centre is directly related to innovation.
And if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre, then the government is also thinking about providing a huge amount of Rs. 10 crore.
Similarly, India is facing many problems.
We have problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find solutions through technology.
And the Atal Grand Challenge has called upon the younger generation of the country to find out, research, innovate and find solutions with the help of technology.
The Government of India seeks to give special awards to the technologies discovered for addressing our problems.
And I am glad that people are interested in the fact that when we talk about Tinkering Labs, about thirty thousand schools requested and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand institutions came forward for the Incubation Centre.
I am confident that Abdul Kalam ji will work as a true sword- research and innovation to solve the problems of our daily life, to simplify our problems.
My dear countrymen, some time ago, we were worrying about the misery and now the joy of rain is also coming and the news of the flood is also coming.
The State Government and the Union Government are working together to help the flood victims in their shoulder and shoulder.
Even though there are some difficulties due to rains, everyone's mind, every human mind becomes fascinated because the centre of our entire economic activity is at the centre of rain and agriculture.
Sometimes there is a disease that keeps us alive.
But if we remain aware, be cautious and efficient then the way to avoid it is also very easy.
He brought Dengue.
Dengue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a little cleanliness, be cautious and be safe, pay special attention to the children and this kind of disease occurs in the poor population.
Dengue comes first in prosperous areas and therefore we understand it.
You will be watching the publications on TV but sometimes we are very sad in taking precautionary steps.
The government, hospitals, doctors will not only do their work but we will also do the same to you for not entering the dengue in our homes, in our regions, in our families and for not getting any disease caused by water.
On the other hand, I would like to pay attention to my dear countrymen.
Life has become so busy, it has become so busy that we do not have time to think for us.
If you have fallen ill then you feel like getting alright at the earliest and we take any antibiotic to the body.
But the bacteria that are in them are tied up with these medicines and then medicines prove to be useless for these bacteria and then in fighting against these bacteria, making new medicines, scientific discovery etc. years go away and till then these diseases create new problems.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing such changes in itself with very difficulty that medicines do not have any effect on it .
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore compliance of rules for use of antibiotics is necessary.
When the matter of health comes out, I would like to add one more thing.
Though the death rate of mother Kavela has decreased in the last decade, even today, a large number of pregnant mothers cannot be saved.
During pregnancy or deficiency of blood , infection related to delivery , high BP , do not know when his life is ruined .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the last few months.
Under the VDA Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost at Government Health Centres on 9th of every month.
Cannot my doctor brothers and sisters give this work for the poor for twelve days a year
In the last few days, many have written to me.
Thousands of doctors have taken forward my point of view.
But India is such a big country that millions of doctors should be involved in this campaign.
I am confident that you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world is worried about the climate change, global warming and environment.
There is a collective concern in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
During the war of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also discusses the tree.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, "Swaswatth: Sarva Vrikshana", that is, I live in all trees.
In the Shukracharya Policy, it is said that there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
The discipline festival of Mahabharata has been discussed in many detail in it and it is said that the trees that plant are satisfactory for it.
There's no doubt.
The tree that donates gives it to the trees in the world like children.
A few days ago, I found an example of Sonal, a daughter from Pune - she touched my mind.
In the discipline festival of Mahabharata, it is said that the tree also fulfills the responsibility of the child in the world and Sonley has not only raised the desires of his parents but also to fulfill the desires of the society.
The farmer Khandu Maruti Mahatra of Narayanpur village in Junnar taluka of Pune, Maharashtra, married her granddaughter Sonal in a very inspiring manner.
All of them were gifted to Kesar Keri and when I saw their pictures in the social media, it was surprising that even though there were no men in the marriage, the plants were visible all around.
The scene of this picture was magnificent.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of nature love and I congratulate Sonal and Mr. Mahatreji for this innovative effort.
And many people use it.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the Ambaji temple in the Bhadrava month.
And I will tell them that this is the prasad of Mother Ji. If you worry about this plant going to your villages and villages then the mother will continue to bless you.
And lakhs of pedestrians used to come and lakhs of plants were distributed that year.
Temples can also start the tradition of planting instead of prasad in this monsoon season.
It can become a simple mass movement - tree plantation.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that if we ruin our land on the banks of our fields then why do not we cultivate timber instead of that bar
If we plant such trees on the banks of our fields which are furniture and housing, then it can be cut and sold by the permission of the government after 15-20 years.
And you can also become a new instrument of your income and India can be saved by importing timber.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan-Marubhoomi has made such a big desert and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh plants.
There is no small thing about twenty five lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big the battle has been raised.
Andhra Pradesh has also resolved to increase its green cover by 50.
The Central Government has launched the Green India Mission under which the railways have speeded up the work.
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the Forest Festival.
This year in Gujarat, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest, Martyr Forest have been taken up in the form of Forest Festival and has launched a campaign to plant crores of trees.
I cannot mention all the states but they are also eligible for congratulations.
But for me the journey of South Africa was a pilgrimage in a way.
When we remember South Africa, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When this word of non-violence, love and forgiveness falls in the world then the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela swim.
During my visit to South Africa, I had visited the Phoenix Settlement and known as Mahatma Gandhi's residence as Sarvodaya.
The train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled to me and the train that had laid the foundation stone for a Mohandas to become Mahatma Gandhi, the Peter Maritzburg Station - I also got the opportunity to travel to that train.
However, I would like to talk to those great personalities who had lost their lives for equality and equal opportunity and fought with Nelson Mandela.
Twenty-twenty-twenty years ago, he spent his life with Nelson Mandela in jail.
In a way, he had pleased the entire youth and I was fortunate to visit the closest friends of Nelshan Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Katha, Mr. Lalu Chiba, Mr. George Bezori, Ronnie Casserils.
This kind of duties that have been described in the Gita were very obvious.
My heart will remember that visit forever.
Equality and equal opportunities cannot be any bigger mantra for any society and government.
The priorities will be different, but the path is the same and the path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and mother-in-law.
Let us proud of our Indians who have lived and shown the original mantras of our life in South Africa too.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to Shilpi Varma.
Those who have given me the message and their concerns are very natural.
As a woman, I am sorry for her family.
And some people are confused and trapped in the face of rupees.
A new way of looting through this technology is spreading around the world.
And that too on a SMS.
And in a few moments, they came to know that everything has been looted.
But recently I had a pleasant experience.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Artificial pictures are drawn at the station.
If you ever go to Aligarh then definitely see the station.
Today, I am getting such news from several railway stations in India and locals are presenting the identity of their areas on the walls of the railway station through their art.
There is a feeling of innovation.
This is an example of how peoples participation can change.
Congratulations to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, special congratulations to my friends of Aligarh.
And you will also be participating in the festival outside the house.
We have special significance in the festival of Raksha Bandhan.
Like last year, on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan this year too, can you not offer the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of our country
Think, give such gifts to sisters that give them the right protection in life.
And today is social security.
This is the true meaning of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, there are many of us who have been born after independence.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in independent India.
The entire country should be coloured in the color of freedom fighters, the fragrance of freedom on all sides should once again make all of us and the festival of independence should not be a government programme but a programme of the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festivals.
I hope you too will do something or the other related to the inspiration of patriotism.
You would like to keep your words in such a way from the Red Fort.
And todays technology platform is so easy that you can send things to me comfortably.
English rendering of PMs Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
Everybody makes several programmes during the holidays.
And there is a season of mango in holidays, so it is also a feeling that you can enjoy mango.
And sometimes it feels better if you get the opportunity to sleep for a while in the afternoon.
But the terrible heat of this time has enjoyed all around.
But I have seen that the citizens also make very good efforts.
Awareness is seen in many villages and what is the value of water, those who have suffered from water are aware of it.
And that is why there is a sensitivity about water and activity to do something or the other.
A few days ago somebody had told me that the Bajar Gram Panchayat and the villagers of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra have solved water as a very sensitive question of the village.
The crops that used to use most of the water, whether it is sugarcane or banana, have decided to leave the farming of crops.
It looks very easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
And in which water requires at least all the gardens and vegetable cultivation has been carried out.
They have taken all such initiatives that today these villages have been on their own strength to deal with water constraints.
It's okay, I talk about Bajar village in such a small hill but there will be many such villages.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all such villagers for their best work.
Someone told me that there is a Gorwa Gram Panchayat in Deos district of Madhya Pradesh.
This Panchayat has tried to drive out sweet squirrels.
However, water has been saved but when the water falls above, the quality of water also improves.
Sometimes it seems that when the government of India has provided water to Latur by train, it has become a news for the world.
It is true that the speed at which the railways have done this work is eligible for congratulations but the villagers of Pela are also eligible for the same.
I will say that more than the railways are worthy of congratulation.
However, many schemes that are being implemented by the citizens are never faced.
It is the nature of a person, even though many people pass through difficulties, but some good news comes from where it feels as if the problem has gone away.
This year, the news of the possibility of rains from 106 to 110 has been declared since then, as if a message of great peace has come.
It's time for rains to come yet, but good rain news has also brought a new warning.
As much as the news will be enjoyed by good rains, it also gives us an opportunity and a challenge.
Can we run a campaign from now on to save village water
The farmers need soil and the crops are used to be planted in the field.
This time why should we not take soil from the ponds of the village and take it to the fields
This will also improve the field land and also increase the water conservation capacity of the ponds.
Sometimes in cement bags , sometimes in empty bags of fertilizer , rocks and soil , where water is coming from it can be stopped or not .
If the water stops for five days, if the water stops for seven days then the water will fall into the ground and the water bottom will rise in the ground.
Our wells will have water.
The water should be stopped as much as possible.
We have a time of one and a half months for the next one and a half months.
And I have always said that whenever we go to the birthplace of Porbandar Mahatma Gandhi, there is a place worth seeing in the different places we see there. There is also a place to see that in order to save rain water, what kind of 200 years old tanks have been built under the house and how pure water remains in it.
Because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come and several schemes have been made and several costs have also been made so that it is very natural to have this question in the minds of crores of people like Bhai Kumarakrishna.
Those who have religious faith, they have Ganga Mokshadayini.
I will not only accept this Mahatma but more than that I feel that the Ganga is a lifestyle.
The Ganga gives us livelihood and the Ganga gives us a new strength to live.
As the Ganga flows, it also gives a new momentum to the economic activities of the country.
One Bhagirath has brought us the Ganga but there is a need for crores of Bhagirathis to save them.
This work cannot be successful without public participation.
And that is why we all have to become a representative of cleanliness and change, we will have to repeat and repeat the matter.
Several efforts are being made by the government.
Efforts are being made to collaborate with the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have also been taken to prevent utensils and industrial pollution.
A large amount of waste is dragged into the Ganges every day through the drain.
In order to clean such waste, the trash scheme works to clean the waste in Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
These machines have been supplied to all local self-interested institutions and are requested to continue to run them and clean them from there.
And in the last few days, I have been told that there is a lot of effort there and there are three to 11 tonnes of waste everyday.
The waste or black licker emerging from the pulp and paper industry has almost completely stopped.
All this indicates that we are moving in the right direction and awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that not only on the banks of the Ganges but also a person from the far-flung southern part of the country, they definitely say that Saheb, if the Ganga will be cleaned
Therefore, this is the faith of the common man, it will definitely achieve success in the cleanliness of the Ganges.
People are also donating for cleaning Ganga.
This system is being run very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
It is celebrated as Panchayatiraj Day in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today gradually the Panchayati Raj system across the country is working successfully as an important unit of our democratic system.
And therefore, with the help of the State Governments, the Government of India launched the Bharatodaya Abhiyan from 14th April to 24th April, 10th Gramoday.
Today, on 24th day, I would like to celebrate Panchayatiraj Day in Jharkhand where our maximum tribal brothers and sisters live.
And once again at 3 pm, I will interact with all the Panchayats of the country on the occasion of Panchayatiraj Day.
This campaign has done a very big job of awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at the level of village in every corner of India
How to make the village self-reliant
How to make the village its own development plan
The birthday of the daughter should be the festival of the village.
There are many such schemes.
There were programmes of food donation in some villages.
Perhaps in all the villages of India, such programmes have been running for 10 days together.
I congratulate all the State Governments and the Sarpanches of the villages for this thing.
This whole opportunity with innovation has been transformed into an opportunity for the development of the village and for the strengthening of democracy.
The awareness that has come in the villages is the guarantee of India's rise.
Prime Minister Namaskar
I speak from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpur.
I have a question about education in school colleges.
For the past several years, there has been a need to improve the education sector.
For example, not sufficient schools or colleges or not uality in education.
Today, if the first dream of parents remains in every family then it remains a good education of children.
Housing, car, everyone thinks later.
And this feeling of people for a country like India is a huge force.
There should be anxiety of teaching and well-education of children, and there should be more awareness.
And the child also becomes aware that I go to the school for this work.
And that is why I will first urge all the volunteers and parents to talk about the activities being done in the school by giving time to the child.
And if something is noticed then go to the school and talk to the teachers.
This is the technologies that can reduce many of our educational systems.
In a way, it was a priority to spread education all around.
And it was also necessary.
But the greater importance that is to spread now is to improve our education.
We have done a big task of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Now good education has to be our priority from the literacy campaign.
Entry, entrance, entrance - the mantras have been resistant, but now the children who have reached the school have to focus on good education, proper education.
You must have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to emphasize on good education.
But it is true about Sharmaji that we need to improve from duplicity.
You must have seen this time in the budget that the cheeks have been charging.
In the budget, 10 Government Universities and 10 private universities have been asked to get rid of government dams and come on a challenging path, tell them what you want to do to become the top university.
This scheme has been formulated with the intention of giving them complete freedom.
Universities of India can also become a global competitive university.
At the same time, the importance of education is equally skilled.
Similarly, technology will also play a big role in education.
Remote space education and technology will also make our education easier.
And I am confident that the results will be seen in a very close future.
For a long time, people have been asking me about a subject.
Some people write on the web portal My Gov.
Some people write me on the Narendra Modi app and most of these youngsters write.
In today's era, along with study, sports is also very important for the youth.
So one day I also had to talk to you, before that I would talk to you all.
As a result, I had just called a meeting in which NCC was elders, NSS elders, Scouts and Guides, Red Cross, Nehru was a young center.
And when I asked him when he had met him earlier, he said, "Brothers and sisters, this is the first meeting of our country after independence.
I have got the benefits in my childhood itself and I also believe that a new life of these organisations should be harvested, a new strength should be harvested.
This time I have put some topics in front of them.
Brothers and sisters, I have told them that why do not our youth, all the organizations do a lot of water conservation in this season
What kind of programmes can we create to connect the country
What can be the common young songs of all our organizations
How many new things can be linked to their style of functioning
If you write on my Narendra Modi app, then I will send it to the right place.
Such a situation will come up.
My dear countrymen, I am telling you that today we are forced to think about it.
I also see it as a matter of surprising people.
You must have seen that the political situation of our country is such that in the last few elections, there were discussions about how many parties would give gas cylinders
And every political party felt that if it was to reach the middle class society in terms of elections then gas bottles are a big issue.
On the other hand, economists used to pressurize or reduce subsidy.
And because of this, several committees were sitting in which there was a lot of proposals for reducing gas subsidy.
These committees were spending crores of rupees.
But the matter was left there.
This experience belongs to everyone.
But there was no thought outside it.
My countrymen, I am happy to give my account to you all today that I have adopted the third path.
One crore families have voluntarily handed over their gas subsidy.
However, when counted, it was found that more than 80 of these crore families were those who opened their distributors there, stood in line and gave them their subsidies in writing.
This incident has forced the economists of the country to think in a new way.
And if the economists of the world do this then we will do it and the results will come in this way, the economic equations that make.
For them, this is an external event of their thoughts and sometimes you have to think about it.
Today, I urge the entire political class to say that we must do a thing that depends on the people everywhere.
You might not have thought that we will get such a result.
And we should go in this direction.
Please rely on the Marcus that is sending your exams.
Sometimes I feel that sometimes we should declare that there will be no ticket checker in the route of the railways today.
Every newspaper and News Channel has a bad news.
Does it not heal around us in a country with a population of 1.
Please change this situation.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that only positive news is published on the first page of the newspaper.
He continued to say this.
A few days ago, he wrote a letter to me and said, We have decided that we will not give a single negative news on Monday.
Good news is the biggest reason for the inspiration to improve.
Well, it is true that as much as we will strengthen goodness, it will be less for our evils.
If I light the candles then the darkness will go away and it will happen.
You can also contribute to it.
Ravi Ji has made a good suggestion but please do not anger me.
Let us all work together to make it positive.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Very few people of the world will have to know that crores of people come on the banks of the river for a long time.
For the last two days, I have been seeing that many people have been uploading the pictures of Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India to compete with the tourism department of the State Government.
Photo competition, and tell people to upload yourself with beautiful photographs.
And people will also know how many diversity things are happening in every corner of the Kumbh Mela.
So it can be done.
Ju, it is true that I met the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and he used to say that we have given special emphasis on cleanliness.
And it is not just that cleanliness remains there.
From there people will also take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that this Kumbh fair may be a religious and spiritual fair but we can also make it a social opportunity.
We should also use this Kumbh Mela to enhance the love for water, how to increase the faith of water, how to give a message of water conservation.
My dear countrymen, I would like to meet you once again on this important day of Panchayatiraj in the evening.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
You will remember that last time I had discussed a book on Premchand ji's statements and we had decided that we will share some things with everyone through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about books.
I am glad that people are discussing and discussing the books written on several subjects such as science, technology, innovation, history, culture, trade and lifestyle.
Okay, I will definitely talk to you about some other books.
But I have to accept one thing that now I cannot give a lot of time to read books.
However, there is a need for a benefit that if you people have written it then I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But from the past month's experience, I feel that we have to move forward.
Why should we make a permanent Book's Corner General on the Narendra ModiApp and whenever we read new books, write and discuss it there.
And you can also mention a good name for this book corner.
I wish that this Books corner become an active platform for readers and writers.
Keep reading, writing and share it with all the friends of Mann Ki Baat.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country regarding water conservation.
People are aware of traditional methods and solutions.
The media has also respected many innovative zeals on water conservation.
Whether it is the government, the NGs, all are doing something or the other at the level of war.
Seeing the capability of the community, the mind is feeling very good and satisfactory.
Just as far away from Ranchi in Jharkhand, the zeal that the villagers have shown in the Ara Karam village of Ormanji block has become an example for everyone.
You will also be happy to know that the beautiful state of Ishaan India, Meghalaya has become the first state in the country which has prepared its water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, crop farming is encouraged in which less water is required and farmers do not have any harm.
I specially congratulate the Haryana Government for inspiring the farmers to cut them off from traditional farming and for less water crops.
Now the time has come for festivals.
Several fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals.
Why don't we even use this fair for water conservation
Friends, Some things in life fill us with enthusiasm and specially the achievements of the children, their talents, give us new energy and therefore today I feel like talking about some children and these are the children - Nidhi Bipoto, Monish Joshi, Deonshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tivari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Auronatesh Ganguly and Hritik Al-Manda.
Whatever I say about them will fill you with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that cancer is a word that threatens the whole world.
It seems that it is standing at the door of death, but all these ten children have not only defeated fatal diseases like cancer in their lifestyle, but have shown the name of India in the whole world with their valour.
In fact, this month, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow.
It is a unique sports competition in which the Young Cancer Servicer, that is, those people who have come out with cancer in life, participate.
The competition was organized for shooting, chase, swimming, running, football and table tennis.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament.
Some of them won medals in more than one game.
My dear countrymen, I am confident that you must have been proud of the success of India across the sky, in space, in the sky - I talk of Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjiv Haripura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Daga, Kolkata, P.
Arvind Rao, several such people from different parts of the country have written to me on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and he has urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, in the vision of space, 2019 has been very good for India.
Our scientists had left the A-SAT in March and then Chandrayaan-2.
There was no further discussion of big and important news like A-SAT in the run-up of elections.
We had the capacity to break the satellite at a distance of three hundred kilometers in just three minutes from the A-SAT missile.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement and now on 22nd July, the entire country was proud that Chandrayaan-2 had stepped from Sriharikota to space.
But if you ask me what two great teachings I have received from Chandrayaan-2, then I will tell you that these two teachings are Feat and Fearlessness.
We must believe in our talents and capacities, we should believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is completely covered in Indian color.
It is an Indian in terms of objective and emotion.
It is completely a indigenous mission.
The way our scientists launched Chandrayaan-Bey by removing all the technical problems in Vikrami times, day and night, is unprecedented.
The world has seen this great penance of scientists.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that we have the potential to overcome it.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country for science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are eagerly waiting for the month of September when lander Vikram and Rover-Pragyan will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition with students and young friends of the country and invite the youngsters of the country to a quiz competition.
Explorations related to space, Indias space mission, science and technology will be the main subjects of quiz competition such as what to do to quit rockets.
How satellites are set up in the classroom and what information we get from the satellite, what is A-SAT, what is happening, there are many things.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this quiz competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with your participation.
I specially appeal to schools, volunteers, enthusiastic teachers to work hard to make their schools victorious.
Encouraging all the students to join them and the most exciting thing is that the Government of India will take the highest quality students from every State to Sriharikota at its own cost and in September they will get an opportunity to witness the moment when Chandrayaan is descending on the surface of the moon.
This will be a historic event of his life for these victorious students.
But for this, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to achieve the highest marks and you will have to win.
Friends, My suggestion must have got you a joyous opportunity.
My dear countrymen, you must have mentioned one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baats have given momentum to the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today, with the participation of the people, is setting up new parameters for cleanliness.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal situation in cleanliness, but the way we have achieved the Swachhta Abhiyan from ODF to public places, it is the strength of the resolve of 1.
This movement is now moving from cleanliness to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I was watching Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in the media.
Yogesh is a military engineer and has left his job in America and returned to serve Mother India.
He has inspired Delhi not only to be clean but also to make it beautiful.
He started with his team from garbage dustbins of Lodhi Garden.
Through street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the overbridge and the schools to the slums, when he started cutting off his town, he got the help of the people and this sequence started.
You must remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh.
I came to know that Bhai Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in it.
Whether there is no sound in the colors and lines, but the message of Indradhanush that is made from it proves to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us that the culture of making waste to wealth develops in our society.
In a way, we have to move forward towards making waste a junk.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read a very interesting note on MyGov.
This was the brother Mohammad Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: "Mann Ki Baat" programme likes to be heard.
I am happy to tell you that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organised in June.
I feel that such programmes should be held every three months.
Also, the programme should be monitored online.
With my view, it was such an initiative in which the people had directly interacted with the government.
My eagerness to know about the Back to Village programme after the message sent by brother Mohammad Aslam ji and read it and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it.
The people of Kashmir are so eager and enthusiastic to connect with the mainstream of development.
The programme lasted for a week and government officials in all the four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state briefed the people of the village in detail about government schemes and programmes.
How can the Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
Their services can affect the lives of the common man and the people of the village also showed their problems unhappy.
Friends, It was not merely named in this programme that the officers would return to the villages throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat and they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
Many other things were also included to make the programme interesting.
Under Khelo India, sports competition for children was organized.
Turns, Sports Kits, Job Cards of Manrega and SC-ST Certificates were also distributed.
The people of Kashmir became a participant in this festival of development.
It is a matter of joy that the Back to Village programme was also organized in such remote villages where government officials had to travel one day or one and a half days walking through difficult roads.
These officers also reached the border panchayats, who always live in the Othar of the cross-border tablets, and officers also reached the most sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts without any fear.
Some officers were so impressed with their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days.
Such programmes and peoples participation in this show that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir want good governance and this also proves that the strength of development is always heavy on the strength of the bomb.
It is obvious that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, who want to create obstacles can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Award, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has presented something like this in one of his poems in the month of Shravan month.
In this poem, he said that the dam of rain and water stream is unique and the earth is enchanted by seeing its beauty.
In the whole of India, people of different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Shravan as their own.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet.
During this period, the festival of Rakshabandhan also comes to mark the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that during the Shravan month, the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra this time in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave since 1st July.
More than the number of pilgrims who were involved in this journey that lasted for 60 days in 2015, this time only 28 days have been included.
I would like to especially appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
Anyone who returns from the journey becomes admirers of the spirit of enthusiasm and spirituality of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I was told that in Uttarakhand too, since this year, more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the severe disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there for the first time.
I appeal to you all that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty brightens during the rainy season.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps there can be no other teacher than that.
My best wishes to you all that this beautiful and vibrant month of Shravan will communicate with you all new energy, new hopes and new expectations.
Similarly, the month of August reminds of uit India.
However, when we look at TV, we see only one aspect of the rain - floods, filled water, traffic jam on all sides.
Thank you very much.
I also want to join you in this journey.
As much as you are concerned about the examination of your children, I am also concerned.
But if we change our way of watching the exams, then perhaps we can also be anxious.
In my last Mann Ki Baat, I am glad that you must send your experience and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
The teachers who have been very successful have sent me a lot of things by parents and some thinkers of the society.
I will also talk about what I have heard, what I have read and what I have been told.
Some of the things I feel like will be compassionate.
I would like to tell you the messages that the youngsters of India are proud of whom Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar has sent.
You must work hard, but set a real goal for yourself and try to achieve that goal.
When I was playing cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
So it was very important for me to find a halt.
So I thought that I would expect myself and fulfill my goal.
But I am fulfilling my goal and fulfilling it, I am definitely doing some good thing for the country.
And I always tried to achieve that goal.
My focus was on speaking and goals gradually achieved.
I will tell you that your thoughts are very important to be positive.
Why competition
Why not compete
Why should we bless our time to compete with each other
Why don't we competition with ourselves
Why don't we decide to break all our old records
You shoes, no one can stop you moving forward.
And whenever you break your old records, you will be happy for happiness and satisfaction, no one will expect it.
Do not consider friends exams as a game of statistics.
Don't be stuck in the accounts and accounts of what you reach.
Life should be linked to a great objective.
We should go with dreams and we should be resolved.
Whether these examinations are true or not, our speed is correct or not accounts for it.
And that is why if the dreams are huge, then the examination will become a joyous festival in its own way.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill this great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great goal.
And for this, do not be confined to what will happen this year, what will happen in this examination.
Take a big objective and sometimes despair will not come in it if something is less than expected.
And there will be greater courage to make efforts.
Thousands of people have written small things from mobile phones to me on my app.
Shreya Gupta has stressed that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
Students, along with your studies, keep in mind your health so that you can write well in the examination.
Now I don't even say the last day that you should start punishing and go to run three kilometres, five kilometres.
But one thing is true, especially in the days of the examination, how is your daily routine
Our 365 days of our daily routine should be unprecedented to our dreams and resolves.
I agree with one of the points of Mr. Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has made a special request to sleep on time and revision on whales in the morning.
One should reach the examination center before the time taking the entrance and other things.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has done this thing, I may not have the courage to say because I am a little sad about sleeping.
And many of my friends also keep complaining to me that you are sleeping very little.
And this is possible.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
You must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable even if there is some problem in the unity organs of our body.
Not only this, our daily routine also becomes ruined.
And that is why we do not consider anything small.
You don't fail yourself in the habit of compromising with the jute, which is certain.
Decid it, look at it.
Friends, Sometimes I have seen that students who go for examination have two types of students.
You must have seen these two kinds of students.
If anybody can do this better than me, who has a mastery in chequetting and who have chemicalized the world's largest players.
The Champion of the Tewa Chase, Viswanathan Anand will share his experience.
Come, let's learn from them the way you check in this examination.
Hello, I am Vishwanathan Anand, first of all convey my best wishes to you and start my speech.
I will talk about the exams and experiences I gave.
Exams have been like problems in life since then.
Whenever you play, you don't know what the fees will come now, even in the classes you don't know what questions will be asked in the examination.
If you are calm, healthy and have sufficient sleep then you will have the right answer that will give you the mind at that time.
So be calm.
Do not put much pressure on yourself, do not keep much expectations, it is very important.
See it as a challenge: I remember the lessons I have learned during the year and I can solve the problems.
In the last minute, pass out of the topics you do not remember properly.
Some of the details you can remember with teachers or students, which will help you in writing in the examination.
If you repeat your difficult questions, you will be fresh in your mind and you will be able to write it very well in the examination.
Therefore, be calm, take a sufficient sleep, do not be convinced, and do not get depressed in the beginning, but I am successfully able to cross these examinations.
So keep your faith in a way.
Vishwanathan Anand has actually done a very important thing.
Sometimes we used to listen to the events of Arjun's life - how his eyes were on the eyes of the bird.
If you are sad, you are pushing books in the last moments then your mind cannot be calm.
Laugh, let's laugh very much, let's talk to friends, let's see that the atmosphere of peace will be created.
You can imagine that you are standing in a pond and you can see very beautiful things below the pond.
But suddenly if stones are thrown in some water and swelling begins in water then what would be the beautiful things that were seen in the pond
If the water is calm then the things may not be so deep.
But if the water is calm then nothing is visible below.
Then I feel like it would be better if it becomes a little lighter.
So I have myself developed my technologies.
Maybe this is my experience, which will also help you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
He writes on my app: We feel light with friends and family members everyday, Goppa My has said this very important thing because mostly we see that whenever we come to the examination, we sit down to count how wrong we did.
We are trapped in it.
Friends, don't do that.
Just come out of it and spend half an hour.
Rajat ji's talk is really worth understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, while describing him in the present context, he is trying to reach Sarita this culture of the country and the world.
Such revered Muraribapu has also sent a very important drop to the students.
And he is also a teacher, a thinker and hence he is involved in his words.
I feel that we can be very happy and happy by accepting the situation.
If you go ahead with your exams, you will certainly be successful and if you do not get success, you will not be slaughtered and you will be proud to be successful.
I also express my gratitude to the priest Murari Babu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I would like to tell you another thing today.
I am seeing that this time people who have told me their experiences have definitely discussed Yoga.
Well, friends, I will make it clear today that if you start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
However, it is true that Yoga is a big key in the development journey of the mindset, whether in student life or in the middle of life.
Ease of chewing.
Look, if you can.
I have great faith in it.
Don't do that.
But if we read the suggestions then perhaps we cop up that yes, it's okay, let's go.
And I would urge you to read your suggestions even if you go to it for five minutes.
When I read it for the first time, it seemed as if it didn't come to me, but when I read the same thing again, it was noticed that no questions were asked again, but this was the case that I received.
Rao, he stressed patience.
Even in very few words, a good message has been given to all the students.
Come, listen to the message of Rao Saheb.
The Prime Minister said, Your Excellency from Bangalore to C.
N.
R.
Rao speaks.
I believe that it is natural to have anxiety due to the examination.
And these are competitive examinations.
Don't worry, you do good work.
I say the same to my young friends.
Always remember that there is a lot of opportunities in this country.
Like mountains and trees you have the right to be here too.
You should be strong, integrity and penance.
With this quality, you will be successful in every examination and other efforts.
Good Blace, how is the way to talk about a scientist
This is the power of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring the children of the country.
Whatever they have spoken is: dedication, determination, education.
If you're supposed to be afraid too.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do good work.
Now I have given a message regarding the experience of exams on my app.
He said that in his family, efforts are made to create a positive environment at the time of examination.
This is true that the Secretary also said, "Positive Approach, Positive Frame of Mind.
We study in our course of the Electricity Round Researcher Thomas Alva Adition.
Friends, how many years have taken them to do this thing, how many times they were unsuccessful, how much time was spent, how much money was spent, how much disappointment was due to failure.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates our lives.
It is said that the possibilities of success are also hidden in failure.
Who does not know Shrinivas Ramanujan
He did not even have any special training in his formal education.
However, he contributed in various fields like Methematical Analysis, Number Theory.
K.
Rolling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone at any time.
Hairy Potter Category is popular all over the world today, but it was not in the beginning.
He had to bear a lot of difficulties.
Rolling said that in trouble, he used to work with full energy, which was really important for him.
Nowadays the examination takes place not only for the students but for the entire thinking and for the entire school and for the teacher.
However, it is not good for the students to be alone without the help of the girl and the teacher.
Whether it is a teacher or a senior student, the examination becomes easier if it moves forward in a planned manner by forming a unit.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App - he has complained that parents should never pressurize them to bring more marks on their children.
They should be encouraged to prepare only.
If the child is talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Make a light environment, create a positive environment, be it your son or daughter, see how much confession comes.
You will also be able to see that conference.
Friends, one thing is certain, especially I want to tell young friends, the life of our people has changed much more than our older generations.
Every moment, innovation, new technologies and science are seen in the form of new colors.
And we don't just feel like that.
We also want to go ahead with the rapid pace of science.
I am doing this because today is the National Science Day.
The Science Festival of the country is celebrated on 28th February as National Science Day.
28th February, 128th Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery of Roman Effect.
He received the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
Therefore, the country is celebrated on 28th February as National Day.
The curiosity is the people of science.
And without science and technology, new innovation cannot be possible.
Emphasis on new innovations in the country on this National Science Day.
All these aspects of knowledge and technology should be an inclusive part of our development journey.
And this time the theme of National Science Day is Make in India Science and Technology Drive Innovations.
Friends, sometimes successes come after a long time and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world changes.
If you are very busy in the examination, you might have been able to report a lot in your mind.
But I would like to tell the countrymen again this thing.
You must have heard in the last few days that science has been very big and important in the world.
The scientists of the world have worked hard, generations have come, they have done something or the other and after about a hundred years a success has been achieved.
The discovery of our scientists was enlightened by the gravitational waves.
This discovery is a far-reaching success of science.
This discovery does not only prove the theory of our great scientists in the last century but is considered a great discovery for physics.
This entire humanity will work for the entire world.
But as an Indian, we are happy to note that the sons of our country were associated with the process of exploration.
Our scientists will continue to work towards furthering research in the future.
India will also be a partner in international efforts.
And my countrymen, we have made an important decision in the last few days.
In order to achieve more success in this discovery, the government has decided to open the Laser Interformator Rural Wave Observatory which is called Lego soon.
The connectivity of India will give a new energy and a new momentum to this process.
India will definitely become an active partner in this greater scientific research process of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all the scientists.
Tomorrow, you can listen to my Mann Ki Baat by messing on that number.
Your mother tongue will also be able to hear.
The number of medals is 8108-8108.
81908-81908 dollars, your examination is going on.
You know, hey brother, tomorrow's budget.
All of us celebrated the festival of Christmas on the occasion of Paramdivas and now preparations are being made to welcome the New Year.
India is a country full of diversity.
In a way every festival keeps waiting for another festival.
Sometimes it feels that India is a country where there is a festival-run economy.
This is the reason for the economic activities of the poorer sections of the society.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on behalf of me on Christmas and my best wishes to the New Year of 2016.
May the year 2016 bring immense happiness to all of you.
May a new zeal, a new zeal and a new pledge bring you to new heights.
Shri Ganesh V.
Savleshwarkar has written to me that this weather is the season of tourists.
A large number of tourists from all over the country come.
People also go to celebrate holidays.
As much as our tourist destinations are clean, India's image will be better in the world.
I welcome the ideas of Ganesh ji and I am delivering the message of Ganesh ji to the countrymen.
And we also say the guest goddess Bhav and whenever we have to visit a guest there.
And at our tourist destinations, at the recognition places of the tourists, on our pilgrimage destinations, indeed it is a special focus.
They are ordinary artisans and work hard, labourers.
He has done a unique job that has been published by the newspaper.
And when this thing came in my mind, I also felt that I had brought this thing to you.
In Bhojpura, he has made 100 toilets so far, considering that this work is a sacred work without his hard work.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear things of despair about the country.
And this is the same thing that pushes the country forward. And it feels very natural for him to take pride for Dilip Singh in Mann Ki Baat.
This is the result of the tireless efforts of many people that the country is moving forward very fast.
125 crore Indians are moving forward one step by one step and the country is also moving forward.
Excellent education, excellent skills and employment opportunities.
It is a big task to provide easy loans to the people of the common family who cannot reach the windows of the bank.
Who can forget the occasion of Yashoda Mata and Krishna when Balakrishna opened his mouth and visited Mother Yashoda to the whole Brahmanda.
The event of Yoga has made India unhappy.
Cleanliness is in a way in the household.
The participation of citizens is also increasing.
The villages that will have electric pillars after so many years of independence, the zeal and zeal that the darkness of the village cannot be guessed by the people who live in cities or those who use electricity.
Till now, it has not been discussed in the media but I am confident that the media will certainly reach such villages and the biggest benefit will be that the employees of the government who are doing this work will be so satisfied that they have done something that will bring about a change in the lives of some village.
Whether it is a farmer or a poor or a young man or a woman, should all these services be provided or not
Therefore, it should not be reached that what the government has done and which government has not worked.
But that is why if they are entitled to this thing, they should not let it go.
Should they also get information about their rights
We should all try to reach the right thing, the good thing, the work of human beings, the more people can reach.
This is also the work of a service.
I have also made a small effort to do this thing in my own way.
I can't do everything alone.
But should I also do some of what I am doing
An ordinary citizen can also connect with me by downloading the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone.
And I will continue to share such small things.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that people also tell me a lot of things.
How will I reach without your help
Come, let us all come together to bring things about the interests of the common man, to the common man's language and to inspire them, to get their rights.
This was followed by all the departments of the government.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India is going to launch the entire Action Plan of Start-up India, Stand-up India.
And in this programme, IITs, IIMs, Central Universities, NITOs and other youths from across the country will be connected to this programme through live connectivity.
Be it digital world or IT business, this startup is for them.
No, we have to bring about changes in this regard as per the requirement of India.
The market will be available.
In the same way is the intelligence wealth of our youth limited to some cities
This idea is wrong.
In every corner of India, the youngsters have talent and the chame should get an opportunity.
This Start-up India, Stand-up India should not be confined to some cities.
And I also urge the State Governments to take this step forward.
On January 16, I will definitely be present in front of you in detail and will always be welcome to your suggestions.
Friends, On January 12, Swami Vivekananda is the birth anniversary of the youngsters.
Those who are getting inspiration from Swami Vivekanand Ji.
Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (National Youth Festival) is celebrated as National Youth Festival from 15th to 12th January.
This year, he is scheduled to be held from 12 January to 16 January in Rampur, Chhattisgarh.
And I have been told that this time is his theme because his organisation is theme-based, that theme is very good. I have been told that the Indian Youth of Development Skill and Herme is going to collect more than 10 thousand young people from all the states and every corner of India.
Youth is to create a vision of India.
In a way, the flood of dreams is to be seen.
There is a feeling of determination.
Can you inform me about this youth festival
I especially urge the young friends to be my Narendra Modi App.
So I will wait for you to know your thoughts about the Youth Festival on the Narendra Modi App.
Dilip Chauhan, Ahmedabad, a Visually Challenged Teacher, celebrated the Excellent India Day in his school.
He has called me and expressed his feelings and celebrated the Excellent India journal at Sir and my school.
We enjoyed the school and encouraged the children to help the disabled in the society.
I feel that you were the first to do this.
Dilip ji is very grateful to you.
And you are working in this field yourself.
You understand these things very well and if you give it then you will have to face many problems.
Sometimes there is an opportunity to meet such a person in the society and some thoughts come in our mind.
We also express our vision of visiting them according to our thinking.
And many words have been used in the world for such people, but there is always a contemplation of words.
Every time people feel that the identity of this word does not seem good for them, it does not seem respectable.
This year, when the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, I was about to visit the programme.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in the districts of Tamil Nadu, I was not able to attend the launch programme that day.
But he had to go to the programme. He used to think about something or the other in my mind.
At that time I had thought in my mind that God has given some damage to those who have caused some deficiency in the body, one organ used to work properly, we also call them handicapped and we know as disabled.
But whenever we come to their introduction then it is known that we see a deficiency of them from our eyes but God has given them some special impetus.
After that, I thought in my mind that we feel that it is disabled from the eyes, but it feels that it has an extra power.
And then I thought in my mind that why not use the word Divyang in place of handicappedness in our country .
These are those people who have such a part that there are more than one organ in which there is divineity, there is a transmission of Divya Shakti, which is not with us ordinary body.
I feel this word very good.
My countrymen, can we preach the habit of the word Divyang in place of disability
I assure you that you will take this thing forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
Under this, we will make it easier for the people of Divyang by improving the interconnection in both physical and indirect ways.
Whether it is a school or a bus station or a railway station, there are ramps in it, accessible parking, accessible lifts, braille scripts, how many things are there.
They need innovations, technologies, systems, sensitivity to simplify their availability.
We have taken up this task.
Peoples participation is also being achieved.
They shouldn't be dead in files.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made an effort to ensure that the benefits of the schemes are easily available to them.
In our country, subsidy is provided in gas cylinders.
The government has made some changes.
Be it Jan Dhan Accounts, Aadhar Cards, the world's largest, largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme with the help of Bada, subsidies directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries.
This scheme has been known as the initiative and the experiment has been very successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore cooking gas users have become beneficiaries of the Pahal Yojana.
14 crore people have started going straight into the bank account.
No intermediaries, no recommendations, no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, the campaign of Aadhar card, opening of Jan Dhan Account on the other, on the other hand, the State Government and the Government of India together prepare a list of beneficiaries.
So far, about 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to the beneficiaries accounts through various schemes.
I am sure that about 35 to 40 projects are being directly included in the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, a golden moment of the Republic of India is also a pleasant coincidence that this time is the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the builder of our Constitution.
There was a special discussion on the Constitution for two days in the Parliament and it was a very good experience.
All the parties, all the MPs discussed the sacredness of the Constitution, the importance of the Constitution, the understanding of the Constitution in the true form.
We should take this step forward.
Can the Republic Day really connect the masses with the system
Our Constitution gives us a lot of rights and the discussions of the officers should be done naturally and should be done.
However, the Constitution also emphasizes the duty.
But it has been seen that the discussion of duties is very low.
It is our sacred obligation that when elections are held, there are all-round publications, walls, hoardings are placed or voting.
There is a lot of fun at the time of voting but why should not there be talk of fun in adventurous life
When we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar this year, can we take part in schools, in our villages, in our villages, in our cities, in different societies, in organisations, essay competition, poetry competition, scholarship etc.
If 1. 25 billion citizens of the country get stuck in one step after another due to duties then how big history can be created.
Can you send it to me
I would like to know your thoughts.
He sent me to my portal My Gov.
I would definitely like to know what the youth of my country think about the duties
There is a desire to make a little suggestion.
Whenever we celebrate Republic Day on 26th January, we have statues of all the great men in our city by citizens, by the children of school colleges.
And I am not waiting for the government.
For the sake of society, for the sake of the country, can we make it a simple nature
On 26th January, let us all work together to honour the statues of such great men, the cleanliness of the complex and all this should be done by the people and by the citizens.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to the New Year 2016.
Somebody might have got the opportunity to visit.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business and jobs have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
In every corner of the world, news of natural calamities continues to be received and sometimes it has not been heard or thought is reported.
People are also feeling that the impact of climate change is growing at a rapid pace.
Many people have died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
The State Governments are fully engaged in rescue of relief.
The central government also always works together.
Now a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
However, whenever there is a need to bring about a lot of change in the situation around us.
15 years ago, the natural disaster was a part of the agriculture sector as more and more natural disasters were confined till then.
Today the form of this has changed.
At every level, it has become very important to work for our capacity building.
The governments, the civil society, the citizens and every small institution will have to work very scientificly for capacity building.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I spoke to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
And I had suggested to them that we should jointly combine SAARC countries for disaster eradication.
I am glad that a tabletok exercise ease and best practices of SAARC countries were concluded in Delhi.
It's a good beginning.
I have received a phone call from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
(He speaks from Jalandhar in Punjab district.
We do organic farming here and guide many people.
I am very happy to hear your messages.
Not only this, you know the problem of farmers.
And your concerns are true but this is not just happening in Punjab, Haryana.
This is our habit throughout India and traditionally we move on the way to burn the ruins of our crops.
But the pain you have expressed is true.
The first solution is to train our farmer brothers and sisters.
But it's not true.
The ruins of crops are also very precious.
It itself is a biological fertilizer.
We give it a wedfi.
Not only this, if its small pieces are made then it becomes a dry fruit for animals.
Secondly, due to the burning, the upper layer of the land burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a moment that our bones are strong, our heart is strong, our kidneys are good, but if the skin above the body burns then what will happen
Heart will not be able to live even if it continues.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And therefore we should make a positive effort.
This supplement is supplied once again in the land.
Or if a piece of water is dragged into a piece of ointment then it becomes a good kind of biological fertilizer.
Not only this, if you put the fertilizers prepared in the land then it will benefit twice.
Once I got the opportunity to interact with the farmers of banana cultivation.
And he gave me a good experience.
Earlier when they used to cultivate banana and when banana crops were over, they had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 per hectare to clean it.
And till the time the people who picked it up, they used to keep on taking the tractor-bacter.
However, some farmers proved that they made six-six, eight-eight inches pieces of this lime and buried them in the ground.
The water that is in that furnace keeps the crop alive.
Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember the International Day of Personnel with DCAbilities on December 3 next.
Last time, I had a discussion on Mann Ki Baat.
Helpline of MNOTO was also discussed for organ donation.
On November 2, the Indian Organ Donation Day was celebrated.
Many well-known people, including film actor Ravina Tandon, joined it.
Angan donation can save valuable lives.
Whenever the organ goes from one body to another, the organ gets a new life but it gets a new life.
I am confident that this sector will also increase comprehensive awareness and in the true sense, the needy will get the best as this help cannot be donated unless it is available.
I had earlier said that December 3 is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people also have an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes they feel painful when they enjoy.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and compassion is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change our vision towards them then these people can inspire us to live.
Something can inspire to get rid of.
We start crying even if we have a little problem.
When I remember that my problem is very small, how does he perform
And therefore, all these are the source of inspiration for us.
His lifestyle of resolving their resolves with their lives is also commendable.
Javed Ahmed, I would like to talk to him today.
40-42 years of age.
In 1966, Javed Ahmed was shot by the terrorists in Kashmir.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
The injury of terrorism cannot be defeated.
The body does not support but for 20 years they have been drowned in the study of children.
How to improve infrastructure for physically handicapped people
How to develop facilities for handicapped people in government offices at public places
They are working on it.
He also turned his studies in that direction.
He obtained master degree in social work and became a messenger of the disabled as a social servant, he is making a silent revolution today.
Is the life of Javed not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specifically recall the life of Javed Ahmed for his penance and dedication on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, I may be talking about Javed but in every corner of India there has been lightning of such inspiration.
They are spreading new lights and showing ways to live.
On 3rd December, there is an opportunity to remember all of them and get inspiration from them.
Be it a middle class person or be it a lower middle class person or be it a poor person or be it afflicted, afflicted, afflicted and disadvantaged person, there is a constant fall with the government systems.
And as a citizen, sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes get a bad experience from some government Babu.
And that very bad experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
Sometimes we don't even know because we don't even know that any government system, any government servant is doing this thing.
ASHA workers in our country are networks across the country.
I have never heard about ASHA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard.
But whenever I am the world famous family of the Bill Gates Foundation, his success in the world has become an enterprise.
The Bill Gates and the Milinda Gates were jointly given the Padma Vibhushan.
They do a lot of social work in India.
The time of his retirement and whatever he earns throughout his life is being used for the work of the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of Odisha had specially honoured an ASHA worker on Independence Day.
The primary facilities they have been taught to be treated on the basis of them.
Emphasis on using every household insecticide mosquitoes.
As your child sleeps well and as much as he should be careful, ASHA worker Jamuna Manisingh is working in a dedicated manner to save the entire village from mosquitoes.
And he contested malaria and prepared the entire village to compete.
If you come then you will have a lot of money.
How many lakhs will be around us.
We will look at him with respect.
Such people become the greatest potential of our country.
How many great friends of the happiness of the society become.
I sing all these ASHA workers with pride through the gathering.
In the context of the inspirational events of Swachh Bharat, the ideal village of Parliamentarians and health sectors.
I urge you to see it.
Not only this , show others as well .
Read it and make it possible that you want to write something like this.
So you must be mygov.
Please send in.
Such things do not come in our mind very soon but it is true for the society.
The positive potential is the biggest energy.
You should also tell good events - sharing them.
So you can actually become a social teacher.
The temperature of the earth should not increase now.
It is also the responsibility of everyone, it is also anxiety.
And it is the first way to save temperature.
Energy Safety Conservation is the 14th December National Energy Conservation Day.
Several schemes are underway from the government.
Bulb schemes are underway.
Once I had said that on the night of full moon, the light of the whole moon should be bathed in the darkness by shutting down the lights of the lights of the sweet light.
He should feel the light of the moon.
If a friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see it then I thought I was telling you that.
In Kanpur, a woman named Noorjahan does not seem to have got the privilege of learning more from TV.
But they are doing such a thing that perhaps nobody has thought.
They are working to provide light to the poor using solar energy.
He has formed a committee of women and has set up a plant with a solar powered phans.
And at a rent of Rs. 100 a month, he is giving a loan.
People take the phans in the evening and come in the morning and give it again for charging.
And in a large number, I have heard that people from 500 houses come.
Now see what the big people of the world would have done for climate change, but an uninterrupted amount is inspiring everybody.
And Nurjahan means publishing the world.
They are spreading light through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and congratulate Jee TV as he presented this work in a small corner of Kanpur in front of the country and the world.
Many congratulations.
Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey of Uttar Pradesh has made me a phone call.
We want to know from the elderly Prime Minister how the money bank runs, how is the help given to adventurous people like us
Mudra promotes business entrepreneurs.
Mudra creates income opportunities.
And the Mudra is truly empowered.
This Mudra scheme is underway to help small adventures.
However, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But the beginning is good.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Whether it is a dhobi, a teacher, a newspaper reader, a milk seller, a small businessman and I am happy that there are about 24 lakh women in 66 lakhs.
Most of the SCs, STs, OBCs are those who work hard and try to run their families with respect.
Abhishek has spoken of his own enthusiasm.
I have a lot of news.
Someone has just told me that there is a slaughter in Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, he got a loan of Rs. 8.
And he started the business of Suez Dress Safai.
During my Swachhta Abhiyan, I had said that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new adventures.
And Shailesh Bhonsle did it.
They have brought a tanker and I am told that in such a short span of time they have paid Rs. 2 lakhs to the bank.
Finally, this is the purpose of our Mudra Yojana.
But earlier they used to bring money with more interest.
And earlier due to excessive interest and due to other reasons, the amount of money that was spent in their hands was now saving about one thousand rupees per month.
And a good business of his family also started growing gradually.
But I would like the scheme to be more propagated.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help more and more small people.
Indeed, the economy of the country runs by these people.
Small working people are the economic potential of the country.
We also want to focus on it.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary, we had discussed Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should be constantly aware of social life.
What should be the framework of the program
What should be Logo .
How to increase public participation
I had said for all these suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I look forward to further suggestions.
I look forward to a lot of square schemes.
And I am told that the participants will have to get certificates.
A large number of prizes have been announced.
You also run your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity be made the mantra of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat to connect this mantra with one Indian
Be it living, glorious, life-saving, and it is easier to connect everyone, what should the government do
What should the society do
What does the civil society do
There can be a lot of things.
I am confident that your suggestions will definitely be used.
My dear brothers and sisters, winter has come.
I would urge you to use this good weather for some time to keep the body healthy.
And to create an atmosphere in the family itself, to celebrate a festival of the family, to do this together for an hour.
You see how consciousness comes and how much the body supports the whole day.
If there is a good weather then there will be a good habit.
Once again my beloved countrymen.
Jaihind...
My dear countrymen, I bow down to you all.
Once again, I am fortunate to join you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, India and South Africa are going to play the fifth one-day match in Mumbai.
This category has been named Gandhi-Mandela category.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased significantly.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Kendra of Akashwani.
I would like that if the attention of such skies centres across the country goes towards such aware and active people in the area of their own then the objective of running the country will get a new strength.
And that is why I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the friends of Kannur Akashwani Kendra.
The students of St. Mary Oper Primary School in Chittor in Kerala have written a letter to me.
The letter is special in many ways.
Firstly, these girls have prepared a picture of Mother India with the mark of their thumbs.
I have sent a picture of India's map.
Earlier, I was very surprised to see why he made a map of India with his thumb print.
However, whenever I read his letter, I realized that he had given a good symbolic message.
These are the girls who have only tried to make the Prime Minister aware.
He is launching a public awareness campaign for organ donation.
He has also staged many dramatic dramas so that people understand the contribution.
Organ donation becomes a tendency and activity.
These girls have written to me in the letter that you appeal to people about your Mann Ki Baat.
He says that organ donation should be made a festival.
Recently, I have a lot of messages on the phone call.
Devesh ji of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
The aspirational goal of organ donation by every 10 lakh persons is a very fruitful step taken by the government.
I feel that this thing is very important.
More than 2. 5 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donations are required every year in the country.
However, in the country of 125 crore, only five thousand transplants can be successful.
Every year there is a need for one lakh eyesight.
And we can reach Kewal only up to twenty five thousand.
We can only give one in front of the requirement of four eyes.
Efforts are being made to guide the states in this direction.
Some states have made a good effort to reduce the leaflet and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the forefront of organ donation.
Many social institutions, many voluntary institutions are doing very well in this direction.
The National Organisation and Tissue Transplant Organisation Noto has been set up to promote transplantation of organs.
A 24-hour Helpline 1800 1140 services are also available.
And we have been told there, Ten Tyakteen Bhunjitha.
The best description of the joy of sacrifice is in the Mantra of Tyakteen Bhujitha.
A few days ago, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
And that operation was successful.
A life was saved.
Angandan Mahadan, let us realize the feeling of Tyakteen Bhujitha and give this momentum to us.
My dear countrymen, recently we celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi festivals.
And after a few days I will also celebrate the festival of Diwali.
Id is also celebrated and also celebrated by Ganesh Chaturthi.
The India-Africa Forens Summit is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 2nd October.
For the first time, such a large number of events are being organized on the land of India.
The Choppan has been invited to African countries and leaders of the Unions.
A PACKI summit is being organized outside Africa, the largest convention of African countries.
India and Africa have close relations.
The population of India is the same as the population of African countries.
And if we get both, we are third of the world's population.
And it is said that millions of years ago this was the same land.
Later, these two pieces of the Indian Ocean were divided.
We have a good deficit in natural resources.
And about 2 lakh people of India have lived in this country for a long time.
India has economic ties with African countries, cultural and political ties.
However, India plays a very important role in training the youth of the most African countries.
Human Resource Development, Capacity Building, Over 25,000 African students are studying in India.
And today there are leaders from many African countries who have learnt in India.
So how deep we have
And in that sense, this summit is very important.
Normally when the summit meets, heads of different countries meet.
In the same way, heads of the summit will be held.
But we are trying to mix the people in it too.
About 1600 schools participated in this event.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of school children wrote things that boost India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, an exhibition called the Memorials of Mahatma from Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is reaching Delhi from Porbandar to the Northern States on October 2nd.
Millions of school children have seen this exhibition.
The people of the village saw and how Mahatma Gandhi had played a great role in Africa and India's relations, how the personality of Mahatma Gandhi had influenced both of these landscapes.
The children of schools in our smaller places are also very exciting, their vision is broad and they see how deep they think.
Although this summit is of India-Africa, we can clearly see the opportunity to connect the people.
I congratulate all the children who participated in the competition, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
Last time on August 15, I had made a proposal on the Parliament Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Thereafter, many MPs fulfilled this work.
He was very confused.
Last month a workshop was held in Bhopal.
In this regard, the Sarpanches, the collectors, some MPs, the Government of India, the state government, all of them together discussed the subject of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Several types of new things were noticed and very encouraging things were found.
I would definitely like to bring some of these things to your attention.
Jharkhand is a very big region and tribal region in a way.
He chose the Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to be an ideal village.
It was difficult for government employees to go there too.
I congratulate the Honble Member of Parliament, Shri Kriya Munda ji.
And, in a way, the school provides education for children in the morning and in the evening to make children teachers.
And these children taught about five hundred and fifty neighbours and read them.
If you see, there is no budgetary system in the society, there is no specific system in the society, but we can see how big change can be brought from the will power through the Pudi Gram Panchayat.
This village is known for production of sugarcane and for Kurtai jaggery in the state.
Shriman Ruwala ji inaugurated the Kurtai Gold Seed Festival on 11th March in this village.
People of old public life also came.
Government officials who worked there also came and an exhibition was also organized to increase the sale of sugarcane.
How the village can be made a centre of economic activities, how the sand can be sold in the villages.
Shri Ruwala ji is indeed a complimentary officer for his efforts to build an ideal village as well as a self-reliant village.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be that there is talk of mind and there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai of Mumbai has sent me a telephone message: We clean our homes every year for the preparation of Diwali.
On this Diwali, let us make our home as well as the outside environment clean and keep it clean even after Diwali.
He has focused on the right thing.
I would like to remind you of my dear countrymen, after the festivals of Diwali last year, our country, especially the media, had run a big joke and even after Diwali, the garbage was dumped and said that it was not right.
All media persons launched a campaign for awareness.
And the result was that a cleanliness drive was launched immediately after Diwali.
So, Savita ji is true that even after the festival we should do as much as we worry before.
Every public programme should be done.
And today I would like to especially congratulate the entire media world of India.
I was fortunate to participate in the Safari Sammelan organized by India to Day Group on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhis birth anniversary and one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on October 2nd.
He gave the Clean India Awards and I was also watching how many activities are going on.
For this, people themselves are working like One Light One Mission.
What are the places in our country that have been kept so clean.
All these things came to light and I conveyed gratitude to the commendable work of India to Day Group at that time.
He has been encouraging cleanliness for the last one year through e-TV.
He has connected 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools in Andhra-Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, gardens, several places have started a massive campaign for cleanliness.
Now these news itself shows the power to realize the dream of a Swachh Bharat.
The Mission Clean India Mission is hundreds of channels of our country, thousands of prints and I cannot take the name of all of you in the absence of time but everybody has launched this campaign.
And therefore, according to the suggestions made by Savita Rai Ji, today the whole country is considering this thing as its own and it is moving forward.
From Meghalaya, I have written a letter to our Governor, Honble Shanmugnath.
And through that letter, I have mentioned the Mavalyanong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has taken the challenge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he received the award for Asia's cleanest village.
I am glad to hear this thing that there is a village in Meghalaya in the remote north east of our country which has been in the field of sanitation for years.
This nature of the citizens of the country has become a culture of the village.
This is the only thing that gives us confidence that our country will definitely become clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to say with pride that we had freed our mother India from dirt, my dear countrymen, on 15th August I said from the Red Fort that some things have been such that corruption has been done here.
Whenever the poor person goes for a small job, no one knows how much problems he has to bear and how the brokers borrow their money.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who completes a person in a two-minute interview.
And with this thought I had announced why don't we abolish the tradition of interview for small jobs
My dear young friends, today I would like to proudly say that the government has completed all the procedures and the Interview will not be taken to the non-gazetted posts of Group D Group C and Group B of Central Government.
The Rule will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is going on, but it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to you young friends.
Similarly, in the last budget, we had announced an important scheme.
Gold has become a part of social life in a way in our country.
Gold is considered a means of economic security.
The keys of the difficult times are considered to be gold.
This tradition has been going on for centuries in social life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the gold bank and the bank will pay you interest on it, the amount you deposit and the interest you get.
Earlier we used to keep gold in the locker and we had to pay the rent of the locker.
Now I will put gold in the bank and the bank will give you money as interest.
Say the countrymen cannot become the wealth of gold now
Whether it can change from gold to life force or not
We just have to do the same thing, give me your support.
Now do not keep gold at home.
Its security and interest. Two benefits.
Take advantage of it.
There is another scheme. Sovereign Gold Bond does not have gold in your hands but a paper comes.
But the cost of this paper is as much as a gold basket, the day you return this paper, the amount of gold will be paid on that day, the amount of money will be paid to you.
So we are launching these schemes.
Now we don't need to buy gold.
So I will definitely present this scheme with security guarantee to the countrymen next week.
I am glad to tell you that we are also bringing golden coins with Ashoka Chakra.
Our independence was about 70 years but till now we have been using foreign gold coins or we have been using Gold Bullion Bars.
Why should not our country have indigenous marks
Therefore, in the next week and in the first week, Dhanteras will be available to the ordinary citizens and Indian gold coins with five grams and ten grams of Ashoka Chakra are being started.
Besides, 20 grams of gold bullion will also be available to the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring new changes in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, I am the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
The map of All India comes in the memory of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This great man has contributed a lot to Indias unity.
As a iron man, he has introduced his strength.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but he had a dream to unite India, which he had shown in a geographical way, but this mantra of unity should always be the medium of our thinking, behavior and expression.
India is a diverse country.
Many sects, many sects, many sects, many sects, many dresses, some diverse diversity are our country and this diversity is our beauty.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we could not take pride for the beauty that we could not take.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity, this is the herb of development.
Over the last few years, programmes of Run for Unity have been held in the corner of the country on 31st October.
I have heard that this time too it is being organized all around.
People are enthusiastically preparing for a race for unity.
The race for unity is indeed the race for development.
Secondly, the guarantee of development is also a race for unity.
Come, pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
Please take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
I am very excited for my visit to the United Kingdom this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such sections of the society, whether they are Dalits, tribals, backward children and those who go to learn abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India are going to learn in Britain, this place of Babasaheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for them and will become an inspirational place.
And therefore I am saying that I am specially excited about my visit to the United Kingdom.
And now that building is being built with the wealth of 1. 25 crore people, with the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar, you can imagine how much pleasure people like me will be.
I will also have another opportunity to meet in London and unveil the statue of Lord Bashweshwar.
Many years ago, the work done by Lord Bashweshwar for democracy and for women empowerment is a part of the world's study.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Bashweshwar to the house of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India thought and how long they thought.
You know that when such incidents are connected, the minds of all of us become excited.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Later, your letters are also discussed on the Akashwani.
There is talk of government officials.
Some people write their problems and try to solve problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
However, there is a good relationship between us.
Last year I was completing one year.
Today we are entering the new year.
Once again my best wishes to my fellow countrymen.
Jayhind.
PM addresses Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
I have had a fundamental idea in my life and because of this I have had a lot of faith in Jan Shakti but with what Mann Ki Baat taught me, what he knew, what he knew and experienced, I can say that we think there is greater manpower than that.
Our ancestors used to say that Janardhana is a part of God.
I can say with my experiences of Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have a lot of power and a lot of truth because I have experienced that I had suggestions for Mann Ki Baat and every time I could talk about two or four suggestions but lakhs of people were actively informing me, this is a huge force.
Yes, these lakhs of papers also gave me a big note.
Different departments of the government analyzed the letters of the people and what are the things that are about the policy, what is the personal question, what is the matter that is not in the mind of the government.
Who thought that the source of these information will become Mann Ki Baat
One day I had said that selfie with doctor and the whole world were surprised.
Perhaps in all the countries of the world, one or another has got the dignity of millions of selfie with doctors and daughters.
And when he used to do selfie with doctors, he used to not only increase the enthusiasm of his daughter but also create commitment within himself.
Even when people were watching, it seemed that the neglect of daughters would have to be observed now.
There was a silent revolution.
Keeping in mind the tourism of India, I had told the same citizens that even if you go to Incredible India, if there is a good news then I will see.
However, there has been a huge change in the number of lakhs of people from every corner of India, perhaps the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism department of the state government had never thought that we had such a beautiful heritage.
There was a time when Khadi for Nation.
Is there no need for time now or Khadi for fashion
Today, I am very happy that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year and now this work has not been done due to any government announcement.
On a TV channel, I had seen that a retired teacher was standing in a widow women line to leave subsidy.
The common people of the society, the middle class, the lower middle class, for whom it is difficult to quit subsidy, but such people have left.
Is this not a silent revolution
Is this not a philosophy of manpower .
The governments must also learn that the work done in our government offices is a powerful, powerful and determined society outside Umbra.
We made every small thing ourselves and tried to connect ourselves for the good of the country.
What can be a big satisfaction with this
This time I thought of doing a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
I had prayed to the citizens of the country to mention your questions and suggestions by telephone.
I will focus on Mann Ki Baat.
This is a pleasant experience.
All the adults have given a message.
I liked to hear some messages myself.
My team is working on the rest.
You might have removed one minute or two minutes but your phone call for me is very important for me.
The entire government will definitely work on your suggestions.
But one thing was surprising and happy for me.
It seems as if there is negativeity and negativeity all around.
But my experience was different.
Thousands of people had to say their own words.
But I am surprising that all things were like Mann Ki Baat.
Completely positive, informative, creative.
People have said more than the remaining 70 percent of the energy filling and enjoying things.
They must have heard the radio.
I remember how important the radio would be for visually impaired people.
I see a new dimension and have said so good things that these people and the government are sufficient to make them sensitive.
I have given this message to Pawan Acharya from Alwar Rajasthan.
Listen, what they want to say - surely listen - My name is Pawan Acharya and I am from Alwar Rajasthan.
I am confident that like wind, your feelings will definitely reach every corner of India.
It has been a good suggestion that soil should not be rooted and therefore soil dungs are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers.
Whether it is our navy, land force, air force- Army, Air Force, Navy.
The war that took place in 1965 had completed 50 years with Pakistan.
On this occasion, an exhibition has been set up at India Gate in Delhi.
If you see from the point of view of history then you will be able to learn a lot and if you see for inspiration in life then perhaps there can be no more inspiration than this to serve the motherland.
Whether it is the battle of Hajipeer, the actual north, the Chaminda and the scenes of victory near Hajipeer are thrilled and our army is proud of the soldiers.
My meeting with these brave families was also with the families of those sacrifices and those who participated in the war are now in the northern part of life.
If you want to make history then it is necessary to understand history in depth.
I returned in two and a half hours but you will definitely take three-four hours.
Look at the strength of democracy, a small child has ordered the elderly, but the child has forgotten to call his name at the earliest.
We should also make the nature of cleanliness and make arrangements for cleanliness.
I got a lot of satisfaction with the message of this child.
I also have to hear a lot.
I see the best thing that the Parliament of the country is also discussing the cleanliness of India.
And on the other hand, on the one hand Parliament and on the one hand the child of this country talk about cleanliness - what could be the fortune of a big country
The movement that is going on - the environment of filth towards dirt - the awareness of cleanliness - it will also make the governments compulsory to work.
If there is deficiency, we have to move forward and this India will be celebrated in 2019, when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dream of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say.
Once he said: If I want to choose one of the two freedom and cleanliness, then I will first choose cleanliness, and after independence, more important was cleanliness for Gandhi than freedom.
Gulshan Arora ji from Delhi has conveyed a message on MyGov.
He has written that he wants to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life of great men has always been a cause of inspiration for us.
And it is not our work to evaluate the ideas of the great man.
You will take out any date and one of the grooms of history will get the name of a great man.
Let us remember all these great men in the coming days, let us bring the message of their life to every household and let us also try to learn something or the other.
I would particularly like to appeal once again for 2nd October.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, Mahatma Gandhi.
I had also said last year that you will have all kinds of fashion clothes, every kind of fabric, there will be many things but there should be a place for Khadi.
I once again say that from 2nd October to 1 month of Khadi is exempted.
We should take advantage of this.
And along with Khadi, handlooms should also be given the same importance.
The poor manufacturers will go to the house of widows and therefore, in this Diwali, we must place Khadi in our house and place our body.
And when we went, sales almost doubled.
How many poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot do with the announcement of billions of rupees has been done by you people with a small help.
This is the manpower and that is why I once again appeal to you for this work.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy with one thing in my mind.
You should also get a little taste of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in the month of May and came to meet the family of Subhash Chandra Bose.
His brother Chandra Bose organised everything.
For a long time, I had the opportunity to spend a happy evening with the family members of Subhashbabu.
You can imagine how much happiness will be for me
Perhaps for the first time in his life, the family members of Netaji might have visited the Bada Prime Minister's residence.
But more than that, it is a matter of great happiness for me that I will never have the privilege of hosting such a hospitality at the Vada Pradhan Niwas place.
More than 50 people of Subhash Babu and people from all over the family live in different countries.
I got a message from the Bhargavi ear and listening to his voice, I felt like a leader himself and perhaps he would become a leader.
My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to make a statement to the elderly Prime Minister to awaken the younger generation about water registration so that the participation of the younger generation in the coming days is increased and the government is selecting and running the important cooperation of the younger generation in the future.
Every voter in democracy is the fate of the country and this awareness is increasing gradually.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Election Commission is working as a controller, but in the last few years, there has been a major change in it.
Today, our Election Commission has not only been a controller, it has become a facilitator, it has become a voter friend and in all its ideas, it has been a big change.
The voter list should continue to be upgraded and we should also be surprised.
I am telling you during the elections that after the first polling, drinking water.
Everyone should do the sacred work.
On the ultimate day, I visited Kashi.
One of them, I got the seventh grade student named Krishij Pandey.
He is the seventh grade in the Central School in Banaras Hindu University.
However, it is of very intense intelligence.
But I saw his interest in physics research at such a young age.
It was very surprising that how sensitivities came in robots.
There should be constant questions in the mind of the child - why
How to .
When
This child should ask the mind.
Similarly, I had to meet Sonam Patel a very small child.
It's nine years old.
The daughter of Sadabrij Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, is a daughter of a very poor family and I am surprised that the entire Gita is familiar with her.
But the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him, he used to say shlok, he used to interpret it in English, he used to define it in Hindi.
Only the Gita reads or else the other is very well .
If you take history then you have to face it in the evening.
We all are surprised that how is it so talented in the entire family
I was very impressed.
Sometimes some children are fond of celebrity but Sonam had nothing like this.
Besides what you see on TV, you read in news papers, we also do a lot of work and sometimes we also enjoy such work.
Similarly, my interaction with these two children was memorable for me.
I have seen that in Mann Ki Baat, some people take a lot of work for me.
Sandeep ji, what will you do with me
I have to make a lot of effort in the month to do so once in a month.
Sometimes my friends of Akashwani have to wait for half an hour.
But I respect your feelings.
I thank you for your suggestions.
Now it's okay for a month.
Mann Ki Baat has completed one year.
Do you know how much Subhash Babu used to use the radio
He started his radio from Germany and he was constantly acquainting the citizens of India through the medium of radio in connection with the freedom movement.
He started Azad Hind Radio with a weekly News Bulletin.
He used to run this radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushto and Urdu all languages.
It has been a year since I talk about Mann Ki Baat on Akashwani.
I also talk to you and this is my satisfaction.
We will meet again for Mann Ki Baat next month.
You keep sending suggestions.
Your suggestions also benefit the government.
The reform begins.
Your contribution is valuable for me.
Once again, my best wishes to you all.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modis Mann Ki Baat
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
Once again, I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to do Mann Ki Baat.
People are celebrating the festival of Onam in remote areas and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan.
With a view to social security, the Government of India has implemented several new schemes for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short span of time, all of them have accepted these schemes in a wide range.
I had made a small request to offer this security scheme to our sisters on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have received the first information that 11 crore families have been linked to this scheme from the beginning of this scheme till date.
Moreover, I was also told that about half of the benefits have been given to mothers and sisters.
I consider it a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up in a big way.
The work that has not been done for sixty years will be done in such a short time or why .
I have also seen the Amir of the poor
Shunya was about to open an account from Balance.
However, the poor have saved the amount of Rs. 20,000 crore.
Young people have been employed.
You will be happy to know that in this year, one lakh and three thousand financial literacy camps have been organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not only to open and stop accounts.
And now thousands of people have become officers to get overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana and they have also taken it.
And there was a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
I have brought it to you and now it is your work to maintain it.
Our accounts should be active.
I am sure you will do this.
Last days, the incidents of Gujarat have made the entire country a batch of violence and violence.
But in a short span of time all my eldest citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat have taken care of the situation.
The situation deteriorated and played an active role in the past and once again the Gujarat went on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brothers - this is the true path.
And we have to walk shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution to our problems.
In the last few days, I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
I got the opportunity to listen to them.
And I have really said that I had the opportunity to listen to the kind of things they had experienced that in a way some music was playing.
I looked very good.
Perhaps it is the most important to realize the true form of Islam in the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and generosity will bring this message far and wide, which will benefit the human race.
And I also say to others that even if we believe in any sect, we should sometimes understand the Sufi tradition.
In the coming days, I will have another opportunity and I am fortunate to see this invitation.
In India, the scholars of the Buddhist tradition of many countries of the world will come to Bodhgaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru visited Bodhgaya.
I have the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to tell you specially today.
I have already mentioned this in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard me in Parliament, you must have heard me in public meetings, you must have heard in Mann Ki Baat.
I have been telling you every time that the mind of the government is open about the debate regarding the Land Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion for the benefit of the farmers and I have been saying it again and again.
But today I have to tell my farmer brothers and sisters that the reforms in the Land Acquisition Act have come through the states, if you want to make the villages and the poor farmers a canal for providing water to the fields, pillars for providing electricity to the villages, roads for the poor of the village, houses for the poor of the village, if we have to make arrangements for the employment of the poor youth of the village then we have to leave the law from the clutches of this implementation.
And then there was a proposal for reform.
But I saw that so much fear was spread and the farmer was so scared.
My farmer brothers and sisters, My farmers should not be confused and fearless.
And I do not want to give any such opportunity to anyone who fears the farmers.
We presented an order.
Tomorrow, the period of Ordinance is being completed on 13th August.
And I have decided to let it end.
This means that the situation before my government was formed has now been re-established.
But one of them was incomplete.
And that is why we had brought him to the Ordinance but due to these disputes, these cases were also reversed.
And I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan is not the slogan for us.
Villages, welfare of poor farmers.
And that is why on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Farmers Welfare will be formed.
And when there is talk of the 1965 war, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
It is also natural to remember the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan.
It is also very natural to remember all those martyrs who have maintained the Tricolour Flag of India and their glory.
I salute all those associated with the victory of the 1965 war.
I am happy to hear them and I am happy that India is doing a great job in many directions in the field of science.
Our scientists are really doing excellent work.
Now we have the opportunity to bring these researches to the common man .
How to convert the principles into equipments
How to connect Lab with Land
It has to be pushed forward as an opportunity.
I also got some new information.
I can say that it was also an immense inspiring for me.
And when I had said last time in Mann Ki Baat that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there is a lot of opportunity and a lot of possibilities.
I get several letters from the citizens.
It has been written about Skill Development.
From Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, Shri Prakash Tripathy has stressed the need for good teachers for primary education.
Reforms in the education sector have been emphasized.
I have also spoken one thing to my young friends.
I had told the Red Fort on 15th August that why is the interview for low level jobs
And whenever an interview comes, every poor family, widows and feelings will be found from where they will get jobs
The poor do not have to run for emotion.
No exploitation, no taxation.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially mother mortality and infant mortality rate reduction, call-to-action was discussed by twenty-four countries of the world together on the land of India.
This was the first time in any other country outside the US.
However, there has been a lot of improvement.
India's appreciation is also being done internationally, but this figure is not small
Just as we have got rid of polio, tetanus in the death of mothers and infants also got rid of it.
The world has accepted this.
Brothers and sisters, News of Dengue continues to come.
It is true that Dengue is dangerous but it is very easy to save it.
And the Swachh Bharat that I am talking about is directly linked to it.
We need advertising on TV.
There is a widespread public education in this regard, but we do not pay attention.
I will urge you all to say that we should not make death so cheap.
Life is valuable.
Consciousness about water, satisfaction about cleanliness - it is not right to become the cause of death.
Dengue free testing facilities are available at around five hundred four centres across the country.
Cleanliness should be given a lot of importance.
These days, there is a festival in our country from Rakshabandhan to Diwali.
Why should not every festival be connected to cleanliness now
You see, Sanskrit will become a nature
Hitendra Mahajan, Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan, but in his heart, the feeling of serving the tribals of India is strong.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
This year these two brothers won this race.
Indias honour has increased.
I convey my best wishes to these two brothers.
But I am very happy to note that this entire campaign of them is being done with the intention of evacuating Team India- Vision for Tribal for tribals.
Look, how every person is making efforts to push the country forward.
And that is why when we hear such incidents, chest swells.
Sometimes because of the penalties, we do injustice to our youth.
My experience in terms of youth is different.
Sometimes we talk to the youth and we also learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say, "Brother, I have taken a drama in my life that 'Sande on Cycle'.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day a week.
Today, I specially want to congratulate the Maharashtra government.
The new government of Maharashtra has completed this work and now it will become a grand, divine and inspirational memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London, the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar, which is now being built by the Maharashtra government, will be an inspirational place for us.
I thank the Government of Maharashtra for both these efforts to honour Babasaheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Once again after a long gap, we are starting Mann Ki Baat, peoples talk, peoples talk, peoples talk and peoples talk.
Several things used to listen, repeat and sometimes our words used to be inspired for us in the form of a dream of a family of 130 crore Indians sitting in the midst of them.
You can imagine how the time has passed, how it has gone.
Perhaps it wasn't a lifeless program.
I was doing something missing every moment and when I am talking about Mann Ki Baat, I am talking about it, words are mine, sounds are mine, but the story is yours, men are yours, Parakram is yours.
I used to use my words and words only and because of this I was missing you, not this programme.
I was feeling an emptyness.
But wait a lot on this Sunday.
Well, I've got a chance.
In a family environment, Mann Ki Baat, small, light, society and life are the reasons for change.
In a way, this sequence gives birth to a new feeling and in a way supports the understanding of a New India.
I feel myself.
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to the committee.
This is my journey from Ahm to Vayam.
For me, my silence dialogue with you was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in the run-up of elections.
Most of the people have taken political meaning from it.
For me, it was an opportunity to meet me.
The rest is your curiosity. I think I will also discuss it.
Just as people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I am constantly feeling your efforts to strengthen a positive thing.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are quite different from the regular government work.
Sometimes the work of pushing forward my thought process is done by you some words.
If someone writes for cleanliness, he is also showing his credibility towards dirt but also describes the efforts of cleanliness.
If someone talks about the environment then it feels painful but at the same time, he also tells the experiments he has seen and also depicts the imaginations he has in his mind.
That is, in a way, I am feeling a glimpse of how the solution to the problems is socio-economic.
Mann Ki Baat is like an arisa for the country and the society.
It shows us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate that strength and talent, to provide opportunities and to activate it.
Mann Ki Baat also indicates that all 130 crore Indians want to connect with the development of the country with strength and proactiveness and I will definitely say that in Mann Ki Baat so many letters come to me, so much telephone calls come, so much messages are received, but the elements of the complaint are very low and somebody has asked for something, one thing has not been noticed in the last five years.
When I analysis these things, you can imagine, how much pleasure my heart will have, how much energy will I get.
I have not come here, you have brought me, you have helped me and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
With this feeling, let us move forward the sequence of Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever there was a crisis in the country, its opposition was not limited to the political sector, it was not limited to the politicians, till the burning of the jail, the movement was not united.
There was an outrage in the minds of the people.
There was a thirst for lost democracy.
When we eat food at the time of day and night, what is hungry, it does not know what is the joy of the rights of democracy in the common life, then it is known when a democratic right is snatched.
Every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been snatched.
Perhaps everybody in any country of the world had voted for democracy, not only for the rest of its rights, rights and needs but also for democracy.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, a huge election campaign was completed in our country, from Amir to poor, everybody was happy to decide the future of our country.
Whenever any thing is very close to us, we ignore the importance of it, its amazing facts also become calculated.
This number can seem very common to us but if I say in terms of the world, if we leave China then more than any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the US, about two times.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population of the entire Europe.
This indicates the vastness and comprehensiveness of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha election was the world's largest democratic election in the history so far.
You can imagine how much the need for resources and human power would have been raised to complete such elections.
Elections could be made possible by the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and employees.
In order to successfully finish this great sacrifice of democracy, about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces took up their responsibilities, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also worked hard.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more polling was done than the last time.
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 1 lakh VVPAT machines across the country for polling, you can imagine how big you can imagine.
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his rights.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one female polling station was constructed.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel there for two-two days. This is the true honor of democracy.
The highest polling stations in the world are also in India.
The polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahole-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is also a more proud fact in this election.
Perhaps for the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The percentage of voting for women and men was almost equal in this election.
One more enthusiastic fact related to this is that today in the Parliament, the record 8 is a women parliamentarian.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the electoral process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times that 'Buke No Book' was my request whether we can give books instead of flowers in the welcome.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Someone has recently given me a book named Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniya and I felt very good.
Though I couldn't get a lot of time, I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again during the visit.
My heart was also touched by the simple, simple and simple statements of human emotions.
His interaction contains the spirit of the whole of India.
When I was reading the story of his drunkenness, my mind was going on its own on the economic inequalities in the society.
I remembered the days of my youth how discussions were going on for night and night.
This story of the son of the landlord, Ishwari and the brave family of the poor is learned that if you are not aware then when the impact of the bad world falls.
Secondly, the one who touched my heart was Idgah.
The sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature feeling at such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid reaches his grandmother by taking cheepio from the fair, the human emotions are really at its peak.
In this context, a live portrait of the problem of life of the poor farmers was seen.
Despite the loss of their crops, the slightest farmer is happy that now he does not have to sleep in the field in the cold.
Though this story is almost a century ago, its relevance still feels the same.
After reading it, I felt a different kind of feeling.
When there is talk of reading, in some media, I used to read about Kerala's letter library.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the middle of the dense forests of Idukki.
The teacher of the primary school here, P.
Chinnathampi, both of them have worked hard for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by tied in Potla and laden on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new path to everyone along with tribal children.
The Vanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat.
Millions of people of every age participated in this campaign to read books.
During the time of Google Guru in today's digital world, I would also urge you to replace books in your daily routine after extracting some time.
You will really enjoy and write on the Narendra Modi App about whatever books you read so that every listener of Mann Ki Baat can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad that the people of our country are thinking about those issues which are not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your conferences on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Besides the Pawan Gaurai of Belagavi, Sitashu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf, many people have written to me about the water related challenges.
Water has a lot of importance in our culture.
App: Suktam of Rig Vedas has been mentioned about water, i. e.
Your mother, like mother, bless yourself and your grace keep on showering on us.
Due to lack of water, many parts of the country are affected every year.
You will be surprised to know that only 8 per cent of the water received from rain throughout the year is saved in our country.
8 per cent.
Now the time has come to solve this problem.
I am confident that like many other problems, we will also solve this crisis with the strength, collaboration and determination of 1.
With the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been formed in the country.
This will facilitate quick decisions on all matters related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something different.
I wrote a letter to Sarpanches from all over the country, to the village Prime Minister.
I wrote to the Prime Minister that in order to save water, to save water, to save the drops of rain water, to address the Gram Sabha meeting and to discuss with the villages.
I am happy that he showed full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, millions of people have donated labour in thousands of panchayats.
In the villages, people took the pledge to collect one drop of water.
Today, in Mann Ki Baat, I would like to hear you about a Sarpanch.
The people there are once again ready to play their active role in water conservation.
My best wishes to every village Prime Minister, to every Sarpanch for their activation.
There are many Sarpanches across the country who have accelerated water conservation.
In a way it has become an opportunity for the entire village.
It seems that the people of the village have now been engaged in the competition of constructing a water temple in their villages.
As I said, many positive consequences of collective efforts can be achieved.
There can be no single formula to come out of water crisis across the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But everyones goal is the same, and it is to save water, water conservation.
Drainage lines are being fixed in Punjab.
This effort is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging.
The construction of a tank in Themaipalli in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the village.
There has been a major change in the Kabirdham of Rajasthan from the small ponds built in the fields.
I was studying a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the river Nag.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are working very well on rainwater Harvesting.
I am confident that several such efforts are being made and when we work together, we can make the impossible possible.
When people connect, water will be saved.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I am urging the countrymen to make three requests.
My initiative is an insistence - as the countrymen have made cleanliness a mass movement, let us initiate a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us resolve to save every drop of water together and I am confident that water is the prasad of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier it was said that by the touch of Paras the iron becomes gold.
I say that water is Paras and from Paras, the touch of water creates a new life.
Initiate a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Tell them about water related problems, as well as propagate solutions to save water.
I specially urge different sectors to lead innovative camps for water conservation.
Whether it is the world of films, sports, our friends of media, people associated with social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, people who are narratives, every person leads this movement in their own way.
Connecting society, connecting society and connecting society.
You see, we can see changes in front of your eyes.
My countrymen is my second insistence. Several traditional methods are being used for the conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, Poojaya Bapu's birthplace then there is another house behind the house of Poojaya Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is an arrangement to stop the rain water, then I used to always say that whatever Kirti Mandir goes, you must see this water tank.
There will be many such experiments at every place.
Let us inspire people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.
You can share your content using all JanShakti4JalShaktiHeshtag.
My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude to you for one thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again on the day of Yoga, with fervor, with enthusiasm, three-three generations of each family, together celebrated Yoga Day.
The glory of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for holistic health care.
In every corner of the world, as soon as the sun rises, if a Yoga lover welcomes it then it is the entire journey till the sun sets.
Perhaps there will be a place where human beings are not connected to Yoga and Yoga has taken the form of Yoga.
In India, from Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft carriers, from AC gyms to the jungles, from villages to cities wherever possible, Yoga was not only done, but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family.
We are convinced that healthy and sensitive people are required to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
It was a matter of great satisfaction for me to announce the Prime Ministers Awards for the promotion and contribution of Yoga in 2019.
This award has been given to those organisations around the world which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the propaganda of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, which has made Yoga popular throughout Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutes and training courses or Ms.
Antonietta Rozi, who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
This is an inspirational example in itself.
If this is a matter related to Yoga, can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger have also been honored and it has been dedicated to Yoga for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established Life Mission and Lakhulish Yoga University.
The honour of the comprehensive celebrations of Yoga and the message of Yoga at home has made this Yoga Day special.
Connecting with your ideas is a big journey for me. Mann Ki Baat is a matter of fact.
Come on, let's keep talking.
Keep listening to your emotions, be sure, keep understanding.
Sometimes I keep trying to live those feelings.
Keep getting your blessings.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Let us together enjoy Mann Ki Baat and also fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons.
These brave brave brave brave brave people have given their hospitality for the protection of millions of Indians.
Our brave sons had done one day and night so that they could sleep peacefully.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack, there is a heart-breaking and anguish for the people and the people of the country.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have been raised all around.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who have sacrificed their lives while protecting Mother India.
We all have to face the challenges faced by the country by forgetting all the differences of casteism, sectarianism, territorialism and others so that our action against terrorism becomes even more stronger than before.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour.
He has shown unprecedented potential to establish peace.
On the other hand, the attackers have also worked to answer their language.
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
The Army has pledged to destroy the group of terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the motivation and inspiration of the members of their family has given the nation the courage and strength.
Ramniran ji, the father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all in this hour of grief.
He said that he will also send his second son to fight against the enemy and if necessary, he will also fight himself.
The entire country is saluting the brave courage of Meenaji, the wife of the martyrs of Jagatsinghpur of Odisha.
They have also pledged to fill one of their daughters in the CRPF.
When Martyr Vijay Soren's Parthiva Deh reached Gumla in Jharkhand, he said that I will also join the army.
The passion of this month reflects the spirit of every child in the whole of India.
Such feelings are seen in the house of our brave martyrs.
I urge the younger generation to try to know and understand the spirit that these families have shown.
We do not need to go towards the ancient events of history.
Shri Omkar Shetty of Karnataka, who has been flying on the Narendra Modi App, has expressed happiness over the preparation of the National War Memorial (National War Memorial).
I was also surprised and painful that there was no National War Memorial in India.
This is such a memorial where the brave tales of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation can be preserved.
I decided that a memorial in the country should be certain.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am glad that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, we will dedicate this National Military Memorial to our Army.
The country will make a small effort to pay its loans.
The heart of Delhi is that place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are located, just near it, a new memorial has been built.
I am confident that it will be appropriate for our countrymen to go to any pilgrimage to this national military memorial.
This National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation towards the supreme sacrifices since independence.
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our soldiers.
The martyrs of Amar Chakra are a symbol of the immortality of the soldiers.
The second is Circle Veerta Chakra which expresses the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
Thereafter, there is a sacred chakra.
These Circle showcases the sacrifices of soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who made the highest sacrifice for the country are written in golden letters.
Subsequently, the Raksha Chakra demonstrates security.
This circulation is a line of dense trees.
Overall, the identity of the National Soldier Memorial will emerge as a place where people will be aimed at studying them for expressing their gratitude to the great martyrs of the country.
Those who sacrificed their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed.
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
Last year in October, I was fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our thinking under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women police who are constantly engaged in our security.
I hope you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
My dear countrymen, I keep reading thousands of letters and comments for Mann Ki Baat in different ways.
This time, when I was reading your comments, I remembered a very interesting drop of Atish Mukhopadhyayji.
He has written that when the British caught Birsa Munda on 3rd March in 100, he was only 25 years old.
On 3rd March, Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata.
He further writes that these two personalities are completely different from the family background, which enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand.
To pay homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is right to salute the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great dignitaries have not only brought the name of Jharkhand but the entire country.
The whole country is grateful for their contribution.
Today, if our youth need an inspiring personality to guide, then it is Lord Birsa Munda.
Whenever he was sleeping, the British hid him very carefully.
Do you know why the British took the shelter of such a cowardly action
Because the British who created such a big empire were also afraid of them.
Lord Birsa Munda had hampered the British rule with guns and cannons only with his traditional architecture.
In reality, when people get an inspiring leadership, the collective will of the people is overwhelmed by the power of the armed forces.
Lord Birsa Munda did not fight against the British only for political freedom.
But the tribals also fought for social and economic rights.
They have done all this in their short life.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited, he shines like the sun.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life at the young age of 25 years.
The sons of Mother India like Birsa Munda have been in all parts of the country.
There should be no corner of India where no one has contributed to this struggle for centuries of independence.
But unfortunately, the words of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of them are not reached to the new generation.
If a person like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize his existence then a great personality like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a bigger institution.
Jamshed ji Tata was a visionary person who not only saw the future of India but also laid the foundation stone of it.
He knew very well that it was his vision to make India a centre of science technology and industries.
This has resulted in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, which is now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Not only this, he also established world-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on February 2nd.
You all know that this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai Desai, the master of simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai, the biggest budget presented in Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India in such a difficult times when there was a threat to the democratic tension of the country.
Morarji Bhai Desai had fluttered in the movement against crisis for the protection of democracy.
For this, he had to pay heavy prices in old age too.
The government of that time had arrested him and put him in jail.
But in 1977, when he won the Janta Party election, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The Amendment also added that the jurisdiction of the fundamental rights obtained under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be slaughtered.
For the first time, it was arranged that only after the written recommendations of the Cabinet, the President would announce the Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminal Criminals.
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the manner in which the democracies were murdered in 1955 could not be repeated in the future.
The future generations will always remember their invaluable contribution in maintaining the month of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, this year also there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving forward on the path of a New India, we want to respect those people who are doing their work at the foundation stone.
With their hard work, those who are bringing about positive changes in the lives of others in different ways.
In reality, he is a true workforce who remains selfless in the service of the nation in front of public service, social service and all of them.
I would like to tell you about some of these people.
Talking about Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he worked amazingly to revive the traditional disease color of Kutch.
He is doing a great job to bring this rare painting to a new generation.
The Trie of Life Tree built by Abdul Gafur was presented to former US President Barack Obama.
Shabid Said of Marathwad is known as the servant of Gautama for the Padma Award.
The way he has delivered his entire life to the service of Mother Gau, it is unparalleled.
You will be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-Lynch of America. Lynch has become a living institution of Yoga today.
Even at the age of 100, he is training people from all over the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, known as Lady Tarzon in Jharkhand, has done a bold work to combat Timber's pardons and counterfeits. He not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also motivated 10,000 women to protect trees and wildlife.
It is difficult to find an example of the work that he has done for the upliftment of Divyang women despite being himself Divyang, by establishing an institution called Pragyacharya Mahila Sevakunj, he is renewing the renewed work of making the eyeless children self-reliant.
He has presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their area to join the Self Help Group and inspire them to become a financial step.
My dear countrymen, I would like to talk about the experience that I have experienced for the past few days.
Today, whenever I go to the country, I have been trying to meet some of the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana PMJAY.
Brothers and sisters, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I have seen how big change is coming in the lives of the poor.
If all of you are aware of any such poor person who cannot get treatment due to lack of money then tell him about this scheme.
This scheme is for every poor person.
My dear countrymen, the time for examination is to start in schools.
Different Education Boards across the country will launch operations for examination of 10th and 12th Category Board in the next few weeks.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the students of the examination, their talents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a very big event of Pariksha Pe Church was held in Delhi as a Townhole.
The specialty of the exam-pay discussion programme was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the exam.
Some aspects have come up which can definitely be beneficial for students.
All the students can see this entire programme on their parents and teachers on YouTube and congratulate all my exam warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, be it India's talk and not the festival
Perhaps there should not be any day in our country which does not have any significance, which has no festival.
Because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture.
After a few days, the festival of Mahashivaratri will take place and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, its special significance is spread in our mind temple.
My best wishes to you all on the auspicious occasion of this Shivratri.
My dear countrymen, I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend time with Divyang brothers and sisters.
So, he said, "I am mailing the Prime Minister.
I was indeed very impressed by the power of the Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, I have had a unique experience for connecting you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through Radio, I meet millions of families every month.
Sometimes while talking to you people, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts on the phones, I feel like giving me a share of your family.
This is a very happy feeling for me.
Friends election is a great celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the run-up of all the elections.
And for years I will continue to talk to you about Mann Ki Baat.
Once again I express my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar. On 21st of this month, the country has received a very sad news.
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to the service of the society.
Bhagwan Basaveshwar has taught us that the place of Lord Shiva is similar to being in Kailasam Dham.
His fame was a scholar who had a wonderful hand in English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He put his entire life behind the goal that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
It was the priority of Swamiji's life that the farmers should be well-being in every way.
Siddhganga Math organized animals and agricultural fairs regularly.
I have been fortunate to receive the blessings of Param Puja Swamiji several times.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for revered Swamiji on this occasion.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shivkumar Swamiji and the mission of Siddhganga Math beautifully.
Once again, I pay my homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is also older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
There is no stone unturned in ensuring that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, has an opportunity to vote.
When we hear that polling stations are set up in the area of 15,000 feet above sea level in Himachal Pradesh, then in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, polling is also arranged in the interior islands.
Just for a voter
When we hear these things, it is natural to be proud of the Election Commission.
Keeping this in mind, the entire team of employees of the Election Commission goes to the interior region and arranges for voting and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for making constant efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all the States, all the security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and indefinite elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country. This will be the first time where the youth born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become a part of the decision making process in the country.
The time has come to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register themselves as a voter if they are eligible to vote.
Everyone of us should realize that becoming a voter in the country, achieving the right to vote, is one of the important achievements of life.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote - this feeling should continue in us.
There should be a lot of pain if you cannot vote for any reason in life.
Whenever you see something wrong in the country then it should be sad.
I urge the well-known personalities of the country to create awareness among the people by conducting a campaign about the registration of voters or voting on the day of polling.
I hope that a large number of youngsters will register as voters and strengthen our democracy with their participation.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and these great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On 23rd January, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
You know that many rooms and buildings have been closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
The rooms of the closed Red Fort have been converted into a very beautiful museum, the Museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, Yad-e-Jalian and the first freedom struggle of 185-India and the entire campus have been dedicated to the nation as the Kranti Mandir.
The fragrance of our glorious history lies in each brick of these museums.
The corner of the museum inspires us to go inside the history of the story of the heroes of our freedom struggle.
The British rule had run the case on the brave sons of Bharat Mata - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I was visiting the memories associated with Netaji in the Kranti Temple in the Red Fort, then the members of Netaji's family gave me a very special hat.
Netaji used to wear this cap.
I kept the cap in the museum so that people visiting the museum can see it and inspire it to patriotism.
In fact, the bravery and patriotism of our heroes need to be repeated to the new generation in a different way.
Just a month ago on 30th December I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
In a programme, the tricolor was flagged at the same place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose flagged the tricolor five years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was driven on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there was a tradition on 15th August.
This was the occasion to mark the completion of 5 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled organiser.
A brave soldier who played an important role in the freedom struggle.
Netaji made a place in the hearts of every Indian with the auspicious sources like 'Delhi Chalo', 'Tum Muze Khun Do', 'Main Tumhe Freedom Dunga'.
There was a demand for several years that files related to Netaji should be made public and I am happy that we could do that.
I remember the day when the entire family of Netaji came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we did a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop several places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 Alipur rods associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar or whether it is Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you go to Delhi then definitely go to see these places.
My dear countrymen, today, when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to call you a matter related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of connecting people in the way Netaji also had a deep connection with the radio and he also chose the radio to interact with the people.
In 1942, Subhashbabu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers of Azad Hind Fauj and the people of the country through radio.
I was told that the radio station, weekly news bulletin was also broadcast which lived in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu.
The Radio Station was operated by the resident of Gujarat M.
Vyas ji played an important role.
The programmes being broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the common people and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
A visual museum has also been built in this revolution temple.
This effort has been made to showcase Indian art and culture in a very attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and more than 450 artefacts and paintings of three centuries old have been installed.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanidranath Tagore, Gaganendra Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Selose Mukherjee.
And I would specially urge you to visit there and also look at the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you will be thinking that there is talk of art and I am talking about you to see the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You must have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician.
But I would like to tell you that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made pictures on many topics.
He has also made pictures of animal birds, he has also made pictures of many beautiful scenes and after that he has worked to bring human characters to Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his most works.
He believed that those who see their pictures themselves would understand those pictures, see the message given by them in the pictures from their own point of view.
His pictures have also been exhibited in European countries, Russia and America.
I hope you will definitely go to see their pictures in the Kranti Temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have given a message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Such a saint was Sant Ravidas.
Ravidas Jayanti is on 1st February.
The Doha of Saint Ravidas ji is very famous.
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines.
He said that if God is indeed in every man, it is not right to share them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire lifetime through his message.
It is not wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of the prestige of labour to the world.
He used to say, Man Changa, Kathauti me Ganga meaning if your mind and heart are sacred then Sakshat God resides in your heart.
The messages of Sant Ravidas ji have influenced every level, every section of the people. Whether it is the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or the queen of Meerabai, all of them were his followers.
Once again I bow to Sant Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I will highlight the aspects related to Indias space programme and its future.
He also wanted me to inspire students to take interest in the space programme and seek to move ahead from the sky - Kiranji, I appreciate your ideas and specially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was Ahmedabad where I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that the satellites developed by our students and sounding rockets are reaching the space today.
The Kalam-Set launched by our students on 24th January has been launched.
The sounding rockets built by university students in Odisha have also made a number of records.
The number of space missions that took place since the independence of the country till 2014, almost the same space mission has been started in the last four years.
We have also built a world Vikram to launch 104 satellites together with the same spacecraft.
We will soon mention the presence of India on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is using space technology in a beautiful way in protecting Janmaal.
Whether it is vajjournal or rail and road safety, all these are getting a lot of help from space technology.
Navic Devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in their safety as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve delivery and accountability of government services.
Around 40 lakh households in 23 states have been generated under this scheme.
At the same time, nearly three and a half crore wealth under Manrega has also been generated.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing power of the country.
It contributes to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has provided development gifts to our neighbouring countries.
Through our immense competitive launch services, India today launches not only developing countries but also satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for children.
Our space programmes give children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the boundaries which have been considered impossible till now.
It is a vision of watching stars for our children and inspiring them to find innovative stars.
My dear countrymen, I have always said that the sportspersons will play and this time many young and young sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When sportspersons perform best at the local level, they will also perform best globally.
This time in Khelo India, sportspersons from every State have performed well at their respective levels.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring.
In Mukkabaji, the young sportsperson Akash Gorkha won the Silver Medal and I was reading that the father of the sky Ramesh Ji works as a watchman in a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
So, the captain of the Under-21 Women's Cubdi team of Maharashtra is a resident of Sonali Helvi Satara.
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged Sonalina Hunar.
It is often seen that girls do not get so much encouragement in sports like Kabddi.
Despite this, Sonali chose Kabaddi and performed excellently.
Innovative Shaw, 10 years of Asansol, is the youngest medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games.
In Karnataka, a farmer's daughter Akshata Baswani won a gold medal in weightlifting.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is the resolution of the youth power that is a New India.
These stories of Khelo India are showing that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India but also the youngsters and young talents from small towns and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard of a lot of prestigious beauty competitions.
But have you heard about the toilet shining competition
Hey, more than 50 lakh toilets have also taken part in a unique competition that lasted for nearly a month.
This unique competition is called Swachh Sunder Toilet.
Along with keeping their toilets clean, you will be able to see many pictures from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all Sarpanches and villagers to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely share the pictures of your clean beautiful toilet with MyIzzatGhar on social media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a memorable journey together to free our country from clean and open defecation.
Today, with the help of the people of India, India is moving towards open defecation free long before 2nd October, 2019 so that Bapu can pay homage to him on his 150th birth anniversary.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the audience of Mann Ki Baat has also contributed a lot and therefore, I am happy to share with you all that more than five lakh fifty thousand villages and 6000 districts have declared themselves ODF and the Swachhta coverage in rural India has crossed 8 and about nine crore families have been provided toilet facilities.
My little friends, the days of examinations will come.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and test fights.
Ansul Ji, thank you for taking up these issues.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the period of examination.
Students, their parents and teachers, many people are busy in the work related to the examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all the students, their parents and teachers.
I would like to discuss this topic today in Mann Ki Baat programme but you would be happy to know that I would like to interact with students from all over the country at the Pariksha Pe Charcha programme at 11 a.m.
And this time students from many other countries will also participate in the programme.
In this exam-pay discussion, I will have a lot of talk with my young friends regarding all aspects related to the exams, especially the stress-free exams.
I had requested people to send inputs and ideas for this and I am very happy that a large number of people are holding their thoughts on MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will be placed before you during the Town Hall Programme.
You must be part of this programme...
You will also be able to see its live broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, on 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
We must pay homage to the martyrs for two minutes wherever we are.
Remember the blessings of revered Bapu and fulfilling the dreams of revered Bapu, building a New India, fulfilling our duties as a citizen, let us move forward with this pledge.
May this 2019 visit be successfully carried forward.
My best wishes to you all and my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
What should we do so that we can transform our lives and contribute to the country and the society together.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
You must have thought how to remember the year 2019.
It is also important to remember how India will remember 2019 as a nation, as its capability of one hundred thirty crore people.
It is a matter of pride to all of us.
In 2018, the worlds largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched.
Electricity has reached every village in the country.
The world's dignitaries have believed that India is making the country free from poverty at the pace of provocation.
With the unprecedented resolve of the countrymen, cleanliness coverage is moving towards crossing 5.
For the first time from the Red Fort after independence, the tricolor was hoisted on the 75th anniversary of the Government of Azad Hind.
In the honour of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who served the country in the form of unity, the highest statue of the world was found by the Statue of Unity.
The name of the country has risen in the world.
The nation was honored with the UN's highest environmental award, the Champions of the East Award.
Indias efforts in the Solar Energy and Climate Change have been ranked in the world.
The country's self-defence has got new strength.
This year, our country has successfully completed the Nuclear Triad, so now we have become atomic energy in all the three waters, places and novels.
The daughters of the country have made the country proud by visiting the entire world through the Navika Sagar Parikrama.
Indias first waterway was started in Varanasi.
This has led to a new revolution in the field of waterways.
The longest rail-road bridge in the country was dedicated to the nation, the first Sikkim and the first 100 Ma airports in the country-Pakyong.
India won the Under-1 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India won a large number of medals in Asian Games.
India has performed very well in the Para Asian Games.
However, if I continue to talk about the manpower and our collective efforts of every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that perhaps 2019 will come.
All this is possible by the efforts of 130 crore Indians.
I hope that this journey of India's progress and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will be able to scale new heights with greater strength.
My dear countrymen, in December this year we lost some extraordinary countrymen.
Dr Jayachandran was known for providing affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that they were always prepared for the treatment of the patient.
They used to pay the rent to the elderly patients coming for treatment.
I'm theebeterindia.
He has read about many of his works that inspire the society on the Com website.
Similarly, on December 25, the death of Sulagitti Narasamma of Karnataka was reported.
Sulagitti Narasamma was a helper in delivery to pregnant mothers and sisters.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
There are many inspiring personalities like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the welfare of everyone in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to discuss the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
In the last few days, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are treating the poor free of cost by setting up camps.
Today, hundreds of poor patients are benefiting from this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors associated with selfless service is really commendable.
Today, I am proud to say that Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign due to collective efforts.
Some people told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the Safai Abhiyan in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I got to read about Jayachandran and whenever I get the opportunity, there was a tebeterindia.
I have been trying to know such inspiring things by going to com.
I am glad that today there are several websites that are inspiring the lives of such visions to introduce us with many stories.
Like thepositive India.
Com is working to spread positiveness in society and make society more sensitivity.
I am confident that more and more people will be able to know about our heroes who transform society.
It is easier to spread negativeness but many good work is being done around us in the society and all these are being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is important in every society.
When sports are played, the minds of the audience are also filled with energy.
We have experienced many things in the name, identity and respect of the players.
However, sometimes there are many things behind it that move ahead of sports and those who move ahead of sports are very big.
I would like to talk about a daughter of Kashmir Hanaya Visar who won the Gold in the Karate Championship in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and is a resident of Anantnagar in Kashmir.
Hanaya practiced hard work and hard work and demonstrated himself by observing it in a minute vision.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for a bright future.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about a 16-year-old daughter-in-law.
You must have read it.
Rajni has won the Gold in the Junior Women's Mukkabaji competition.
On winning the medal, Drink one glass of milk and drink one glass of milk.
After that, Rajni wrapped her medal in a cloth and put her in a bag.
Why do you think , why do you drink one glass of milk
He did this in honour of his father Jasmer Singh ji. He sells luxury at a stall in Panipat.
Rajni said that his father has made a lot of sacrifice to reach this place and has suffered a lot.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work before he got up in the morning and his brother and sister.
When Rajni expressed his desire to learn boxing before his father, the father encouraged him to get all possible assistance.
Rajni had to start Mukkebaji study with an old time as the economic condition of her family at that time was not good.
Despite all this, the courage of Raj was not lost and Mukkebaji was learning.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajni.
And I congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani ji for giving her support and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni has become the fastest Asian to travel the world from the cycle.
He used to run around 300 kilometres of cycles everyday for 15 days.
Can we not get inspiration by knowing this kind of achievement
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such incidents, we also inspire us to do something among the difficulties.
If there is strength and enthusiasm in the resolution then the obstacles are removed by themselves.
Problems can never be obstacles.
If we hear such examples then we also get a new inspiration in our lives.
My fellow countrymen, there are many festivals full of enthusiasm and enthusiasm in January like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Madhi
During this time, the sun enters the makar rashi by descending.
After this day the day starts growing gradually and the crops of cold start cutting.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The spirit of unity in diversity, the spirit of Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat is gathering in our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals and festivals are connected to nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not considered to be different and there is only one person and society here.
It is a good example of our close relations with nature, a calendar based on festivals.
Besides festivals, there is also a list of planets.
This traditional calendar shows how old our relationship with natural and astronomical incidents is.
As per the moon and the sun calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the date of festivals and festivals is determined.
It depends on which calendar is considered.
Festivals are also celebrated in many areas as per the status of planet constellations.
All these festivals are celebrated on the basis of the lunar calendar and Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Paila Baisak, Bihu, are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar.
In many of our festivals, the feeling of rivers and water conservation is particularly inclusive.
Chhath festival - rivers, ponds are connected with sunrise.
Millions of people drown in the sacred rivers even on Makar Sankranti.
Our festivals also give us understanding of social values.
On the one hand it has an archaeological significance, on the other hand every festival learns the inspiration to live with each other with brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you all the joy of the coming festivals.
Share the pictures taken on these festivals with all so that the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture can be seen.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of things in our culture that we can pride and show the whole world with pride and one of them is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
Even in films, there must have been a lot about its magnificence and vastness and it will be true.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh fair, the people of faith and devotion emerge.
Millions of people from all over the country are connected to one place together.
The tradition of Kumbh is blossomed and flourished with our great cultural heritage.
This time, on January 15, the world famous Kumbh Mela that is going to be held in Prayagraj, perhaps all of you will be eagerly awaiting.
Cellsilos have also been started for the Kumbh Mela from now on.
Its global significance can also be estimated from the fact that last year, UNESCO has marked the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries had seen the preparations for the Kumbh and the flag hoisted of several countries together.
The Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj is likely to visit more than 150 countries.
The divine divinity of Kumbh will spread Indias magnificence throughout the world.
This can be a very big learning experience especially for the youth.
I myself had gone to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that preparations for the Kumbh are going on at a rapid pace.
The people of Prayagraj are also very enthusiastic for the Kumbh.
There I had dedicated the Integrated Command Control Centre to the nation and devotees will get a lot of help in it.
This time a lot of emphasis is being laid on cleanliness in Kumbh.
If there will be cleanliness along with faith in the event then its good message will reach far and wide.
This time every devotees will also be able to visit Akshayvad after a sacred bath in Sangam.
The symbol of the faith of the people was closed in the fort for hundreds of years, whose devotees could not see.
Now the doors of Akshayvad have been opened for all.
I insist on you that whenever you come to Kumbh, you must keep pictures and aspects of Kumbh on social media so that more and more people get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
The Kumbh of spirituality becomes the great Kumbh of Indian philosophy.
This Kumbh will also be the Kumbh of nationality.
This Kumbh of devotees also become the Mahakumbh of the world's tourists.
This Kumbh of artistics also becomes the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
Poojaya Bapu and South Africa have an unbreakable relationship.
He was South Africa from where he became Mohan and Mahatma.
In South Africa itself, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly in opposition to diversity.
He also established Finix and Tolstoy Pharmaceuticals, from where the world was looking for peace and justice.
2018 is also being celebrated as the birth centenary year of Nelson Mandela, who was also known as Madiba.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was an example of conflicts against diversity all over the world and who was Mandela's inspirations
He had got the tolerance and inspiration of spending so many years in jail from the revered Bapu.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only inspiration for the entire world but their ideals also encourage us to build a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, a DGP Council was held in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat where the highest statue of the world is the Statue of Unity, there was a meaningful discussion with the police personnel of the country.
What kind of steps should be taken to further strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen have been discussed in detail.
In the meanwhile, I also announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity and the award will be given to those who have contributed to national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He always tried to keep India's integrity intact.
Sardar Saheb believed that the power of India is in diversity here.
We pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of unity honouring that feeling.
My dear countrymen, on January 13, it is a sacred festival of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
He had lived in North India for a long time and sacrificed his lives in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi in Patna, Karmabhoomi in North India and the last moment of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole year got his blessings.
If you want his lifetime then it gives a glimpse of the whole of India.
After the martyrdom of his father Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji had achieved the post of Guru in the young age of nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice in Varanasi from Sikh Gurus.
He was a peaceful and simple personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voice of the poor and the vulnerable people, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice firmly for the poor and the vulnerable people and hence it is said that every lakh to one war, Chidio Son Main Baj Tuduantbe Govind Singh should not say.
He said that power cannot be displayed by fighting with the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh ji knew that the biggest service is to remove human sufferings.
He was a divine man full of valour, valour, sacrifice, religion, who had an unilateral knowledge of both weapons and sciences.
He was also an architect of Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
Once again I bow down to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
That is, food safety and standard autonomy is being done by India.
Several events are being organized across the country on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In this series, F.
Under the Eat Right India Mission, a healthy India journey is going on across the country.
The campaign will run by 2nd January.
When India becomes clean and healthy then India will also be prosperous.
The most important for good health is nutritious food.
You should also participate in it and especially I would urge the children to show these things.
Important education of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018.
In 2019, we will meet again, we will talk about mind, the life of a person, the life of a nation, the life of a society, the inspiration is the basis of progress.
Come, let's move forward, change yourself, change the country, change the country too, very much thankful.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October 2014, we all started a journey together through the holy festival of Vijayadashmi, Mann Ki Baat.
This 50 episode of Mann Ki Baat has been completed.
Similarly, today this Golden Jubilee App-Golden Jubilee App.
The letters and phones you have received this time are mostly in the context of this 50th app.
On MyGov, Anchukumar of Delhi, Amarkumar and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain of Delhi, Burdwan, Presensed Government of West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri of Nagpur have asked about a similar question on the Narendra Modi app.
They say that many times people connect you with latest technology, social media and mobile apps, but why did you choose radio to connect with people
Your curiosity is very natural that when the radio had forgotten in today's era, why did Modi come with a radio
I was in the month of May and I was going to some other place traveling in the evening.
In the mountains of Himachal, it becomes cold in the evening, then on the way stopped for tea on a dhaba and when I ordered tea, before that, it was very small, one person himself used to make tea and sell it.
There was no clothing above.
He was standing with a small lari on the edge of the rod.
He said, "No, you don't know what Saheb is a matter of great happiness.
I didn't understand anything. He said, "Look, listen to the radio, there was talk about it on the radio.
The reach and depth of communication cannot be corrected by the radio.
This thing has been fulfilled in my mind since that time and I had realized the strength of this thing.
And when I became the elderly Prime Minister, it was very natural to see my attention towards the most powerful medium.
And when I assumed office as a Prime Minister in May 2014, I wished that the unity of the country, our glorious history, its bravery, its diversity, the diversity of India, the salvation of the people, the devotion of the people, the sacrifice of the people, all these things should be delivered to the people.
From far-flung villages to metropolitan cities, from farmers to young businessmen...
Recently, Akashwani also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen some of these talents which are very interesting.
Out of those who have been surveyed, an average of 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat's biggest contribution is that it has enhanced the feeling of positiveness in society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, peoples movements have been encouraged at a large scale.
There is also a comprehensive discussion on India Positive.
It is also a reflection of the feeling of positiveness and positivity in the minds of our people.
People have also expressed their experience that Mann Ki Baat has increased the possibilities of doing something with volunteerism.
Radio, mobile, internet, Facebook Live and Pariscop are also connected to Mann Ki Baat through the Narendra Modi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you from Mann Ki Baat for expressing confidence in it and becoming a part of it.
Your fear is true.
In fact, if the leader gets a mike and listens to millions of crores then what should be done
Some young friends conducted a study on all the topics in Mann Ki Baat, they analyzed the word analysis, laxical analysis and studied how many times the word was spoken.
Which words have been spoken again and again.
One of his stories is that this programme has been non-state.
When Mann Ki Baat was started, I had decided that there should be no politics in it or the government should be appreciated in it, there should be no Modi in it and the biggest strength and inspiration for fulfilling my resolve.
Modi will come and go away, but this country will remain immortal, our culture will remain immortal.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
This will take the country to new heights with new inspiration and enthusiasm.
There will be such a power of any government that the zobesh of selfiewithdaughter will start from a small village in Haryana and spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Every section of the society, celebrities, every section of the society should be connected and in a new, modern language of ideas in the society, which the present generation understands.
Sometimes Mann Ki Baat also enjoys but there are always 130 crore people living in my mind.
His mind is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government matter. This is a matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is a special India, an ambitious India.
India's original life is not a politics, India's original life is not a political power.
Indias original life is social policy and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life and one aspect of politics is also there.
It is not a good arrangement for a healthy society.
Sometimes the events and politics of politics are so convinced that other talents and other men of the society are buried.
For the bright future of a country like India, it is our collective responsibility and Mann Ki Baat is a soft and small effort in this direction.
Your question is a question of spirituality in a way.
I believe that the biggest achievement of the 50th episode of Mann Ki Baat is that you are not asking the elderly Prime Minister, as if you are asking questions to one of your close friends.
Whatever question you have asked, if I answer it in a direct word then I will say nothing.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Every time people's letters come before Mann Ki Baat.
People share their views on MyGov and NarendraModi Mobile App and also have a toll free number 1800 11800.
By calling there, people also record their messages in their voices.
As soon as Mann Ki Baat app comes closer, I read the ideas and information sent by you during the journey very closely.
And because of this, when I read the letter, I can easily connect that place and context with you.
Later, I remember some facts like the name of the village, the name of the person, etc.
Ask the truth, there is a voice in Mann Ki Baat but examples, emotions and feelings are of my countrymen.
There are millions of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat till date but they keep sending their letters and their comments without being disappointed - your thoughts and feelings have a lot of importance in my life.
I am confident that I will get many more things from before and make Mann Ki Baat more interesting, more effective and useful.
Efforts are also made that the letters which are not included in Mann Ki Baat should also be taken into account by the concerned departments on letters and suggestions.
With his hard work Mann Ki Baat reaches more and more people.
The Akashwani team prepares every appsad for broadcasting in many languages.
Some people efficiently hear Mann Ki Baat in the voice of Modi in regional languages and in the same tone.
In this way, he becomes Narendra Modi for just 30 minutes.
I congratulate and thank those people for their talent and skills.
I will urge you all to hear this programme in your local languages too.
I would like to congratulate my friends of the media who have regularly broadcast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
Any political media is never happy, it feels that it gets very little coverage or the coverage that is available is negative but the media has made several topics raised in Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Dr.
Without your cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat remains incomplete.
Actually, I don't have any mystery.
Whatever I am doing is happening in all the families too.
In a simple language, I try to move myself into the youth and keep myself in that situation and make a valent match with its ideas.
It is the old bag of our own life when we do not come in between then it becomes easier to understand anyone.
The youngsters of today are very high that they do not do anything that they don't believe in themselves and when they believe in something then they leave everything behind it.
Many times people discuss the Communication Gap between adults and youth in families.
In fact, interaction with youngsters in most families is very limited.
In most of the times, there is an obstacle in the matter of learning or habits or lifestyle, the words of the open minds are slowly decreasing in the families and it is also a matter of concern.
Discussion will be effective instead of accelerating and dismissing instead of experiment.
I have been trying to constantly interact with the youth through various programmes or social media.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or what they are thinking.
They always have Idea stores.
They are very energetic, innovative and centric.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I try to share the efforts of the youth and their words as much as possible.
Many times there is a complaint that the youth ask a lot of questions.
I say that it is good that a new question is made.
This is a good thing because it means that they want to check from the roots of all things.
Some people say that there is no patience among the youth, but I believe that there is no time for the youth to get widened. This is the same thing that helps the youth to become more innovative today because they want to do things faster.
We feel that today's youth is very aspirational and thinks a lot of big things.
It is good to see big dreams and achieve great successes.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I say what is wrong in it
He is transparent in multi-skiing and hence he does this.
If we look surrounding, we want it to be a social enterprise or start-up, be it sports or be it a big change in society.
Those youngsters who showed the courage to ask questions and to see big dreams.
If we bring the ideas of the youth to the ground and give them an open environment, they can bring about a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinita ji has written on Mai Gov that I should talk about the Constitution Day coming tomorrow i.e. 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
They say that this day is special because we are going to enter the 70th year of adoption of the Constitution.
Vinitaji, thank you very much for your suggestions.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The day to remember those great dignitaries who made our Constitution.
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1947.
The Constituent Assembly took two years 11 months and one days to complete this historic work of building the Constitution.
Please imagine that within three years these great personalities gave us such a comprehensive and detailed constitution.
The extraordinary pace he created is an example of time management and productivity even today.
It also inspires us to fulfill our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country, each of them was committed to a Constitution to empower the people of India and the poorest of the poor.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties are detailed in detail.
The synergy of these two in the lives of the citizens will take the country forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will be automatically protected and thus, even if we follow our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that when the Republic of India had completed 60 years in 2010, in Gujarat, we took out the beauty of the Constitution by putting an elephant on the elephant.
It was a memorable occasion to enhance the awareness of the Constitution in the youth and connect them with the aspects of the Constitution.
We will complete 70 years as a Republic in 2020 and will complete 5 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us all take forward the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man can never be forgotten which was at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
His Mahaparinirvana Divas is on 6th December.
I salute Babasaheb on behalf of all the countrymen who have given the right to live with respect to crores of Indians.
Democracy was in the nature of Babasaheb and he used to say that Indias democratic values have not come from outside.
What is the democracy and what is the parliamentary system - it has never been a new thing for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he made a very emotional appeal that we have to protect our freedom after such a struggle till the last drop of our blood.
He also used to say that we Indians may be from different backgrounds, but we have to keep the interest of the country above all things.
My dear countrymen, on 23rd November, two days ago, we all have celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and in the coming year, that is, in 2019, we are going to celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought for the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
Similarly, a train will also be run on the path of holy places associated with Guru Nanak Devji.
Recently, when I was holding a meeting related to it, I remember the letters of Saheb Gurudwara at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake of Gujarat, the Gurudwara had suffered a lot, but the way the state government renovated it with the local people is still an example.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit that sacred place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Pakistan and Kartarpur.
My dear countrymen, we will meet once again after 50 apps, in the next Mann Ki Baat and I am confident that today I got the opportunity to keep the feelings behind Mann Ki Baat in front of you for the first time because you asked such questions but our journey will continue.
As much as your partner will connect, our journey will be deeper and will be satisfactory to everyone.
Sometimes there is a question in people's mind that what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
I would like to say today that one of the talents of Mann Ki Baat touches my mind. Most of the people said that when we listen to Mann Ki Baat sitting with everyone, then it seems that the elders of our family are sitting among us and sharing their own words with us.
When I heard this in a comprehensive manner, I was very satisfied that I am from you and from among you and in a way I will continue to come and join you through Mann Ki Baat as members of your family.
Your aspirations, my ambitions.
Come, let us take this journey forward.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
About six and a half months before independence, there was a picture of Sardar Patel on the background of the edition published by the world's famous International Magazine Time Magazine on January 2, 1947.
He had printed a map of India in his main stories and it was not a map that we see today.
It was a map of India shared in many parts.
The Time Magazine wrote that there were threats like division, violence, food hazards, inflation and power policy on India.
Time Magazine further writes that if anyone has the capacity to feed the country in the formula of unity and fill the wounds then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
How did he give direction to Bardoli Satyagraha
His authenticity and commitment to the country was such that all the farmers, from labourers to entrepreneurs, trusted them.
Whether it was Junagarh or Hyderabad, Travancore or Rajwada in Rajasthan, it was Sardar Patel, whose talent and strategic skills we can see India today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after seeing this nation in the bond of unity, our mother India.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be special - on this day, we will dedicate the Statue of Unity to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double from the Statue of Liberty of America.
It is the world's tallest Gaganchubi statue.
Every Indian will now be proud of the fact that the world's highest statue is on the land of India.
Sardar Patel, who was connected to the land, will now increase the beauty of the sky.
I salute the families of our soldiers for their courage, but do you know why the citizens of India celebrate this Infantry Day
This is the day when the Indian Army had landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the valley from bribery.
This historic event also has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old interview of Sama Manekshaw, who had been a great military officer of India.
He was recalling the time when he was Colonel in the interview.
During this period, on October 14, the military campaign was started in Kashmir.
Field Marshal Manekshaw said that during a meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had become a hero for the delay in sending armed forces to Kashmir and Sardar Patel looked at him in his special style during his meeting and said that there should be no delay in military operations in Kashmir and solutions should be taken as soon as possible.
After that, the soldiers flew in Kashmir well and we saw how the army was successful.
On October 31, our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, is also the death anniversary of her.
Indira ji also paid homage to him.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports.
Recently, I had two memorable visits.
Our Para Athletes of the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta.
In these sports, India won a total of 2 medals and made a new Vikram and enhanced the pride of India.
I was fortunate to meet all these talents with Para Athletes personally and congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina had the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to know that our youth have performed the best in Youth Olympics 2018.
In this event, we won 13 medals and 3 other medals in mix events.
You must remember that India's performance in Asian Games was also excellent this time.
Look, in the last few minutes, how many times I have used such words as the best and the most glorious words till now.
This is the story of today's Indian sports that is touching new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those fields which have never been thought about.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur who has won a Gold Medal in the 2018 Asian Para Games for the country.
He is Divyang since birth.
When he was eight, he lost his father.
Later, he spent eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a weater in DTC buses to run a life car and at Dhaba along the road in Delhi.
Today, he has been winning the Gold for India in the Narayan International events.
Not only this, look at the growing performance of Indias sports, India has never won any Olympic medal in Judo, whether it is a senior or a junior level.
But Tababi Devi made history by winning a silver medal in Judo in Youth Olympics.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi is a resident of a village in Manipur.
Their father is a labourer when the mother works to sell fish.
There were many times before his family when he had no food money.
In such situations, Tababi Devi's courage is not there.
And he made history by winning a medal for the country.
There are innumerable stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson is the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, you all will remember that we had successfully organised Fifa Under-17 World Cup in 2019.
The entire world also appreciated it as a very successful tournament.
FIFA Under 19 World Cup also created a new performance on the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football matches in different stadiums of the country and enhanced the courage of young sportspersons.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing the Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will run from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian wants a sportsperson or a sportsperson or a sportsperson, there is a feeling of hockey in his mind.
India has a golden history in Hockey.
In the past, India has got gold medals in many competitions and once the World Cup winner has also been there.
India has also given Hockey a number of great players.
Whenever Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will be incomplete without these great players of India.
Hockey's magician Major Dhyanchand is familiar with the whole world.
After that, Hockey has cut a big basket from Balvinder Singh Senior, Lesley Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pillai.
Even today, team India sportspersons are inspiring the new generation of Hockey due to their hard work and linkages.
There is a good opportunity to see thrilling matches for sports lovers.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all the teams.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian man hockey team for this competition and assure them that 125 crore Indians stand with them and their support and convey my best wishes to all the teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward for social work, the volunteers are inspiring for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, new generations, new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
Every Indian will be proud to see the zeal and zeal they have for this work.
It has a smell of the journey from IT to Society, not me, Ahm or Ahm or Ayushman, from Self to Committee.
Some people are teaching children and some are teaching the elderly.
Someone is associated with cleanliness and is helping the farmers and there is no reluctance to do all this, but there is a selfless feeling of dedication and determination.
A young man learned Wheelchair Basketball himself to help the Wheelchair Basketball team of Divyangs.
This is the dedication and dedication that is going on with this mission.
Will no Indian be proud of this thing
This feeling of 'Main No Hum' will inspire all of us.
My dear countrymen, this time when I was watching your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a very interesting drop of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov - Please talk about Mann Ki Baat how the customs and traditions of the tribals of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
There is a need to learn some of them, how to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
I appreciate you for keeping this topic among the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one such topic that inspires us to look at our glorious past and culture, today the whole world is discussing environmental protection, and exploring new ways for sustainable lifestyle, balanced lifestyle.
Well, our India Year is not free from this problem, but for this, we just have to do so, we have to see our rich history and traditions, and especially to understand the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
Staying in harmony with nature has been a part of the culture of our tribal communities.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like gods and goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe of Central India, especially the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship trees like Pipalo and Arjun.
In a desert like Rajasthan, Bishnoi society has shown us the way for environmental protection.
They are particularly acceptable to sacrifice their lives in terms of protection of trees, but they do not approve of loss of one tree.
Mishmi of Arunachal promises to have a relationship with tigers.
He considers them as his brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, tigers are also seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Varali community in Maharashtra consider tigers to be the guest and the presence of tigers for them is prosperous.
There is a belief in the coal community in central India that their fate is connected to the tigers and if the tigers do not get food then the village will have to be hungry.
The Gond tribe of Central India stops fishing in some parts of the Kathan river during the sanctuary.
They consider these areas as the shelter of fish and they get healthy and abundant fish due to this practice.
The tribal community makes their homes with natural materials and is strong as well as environment friendly.
In the solitary regions of the Nilgiri Plateau of South India, a small rotating community is traditionally made up of the locally available settlements.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living with very peaceful and mutual harmony, but whenever someone is harming their natural resources, they are not afraid of fighting for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, tribals were people.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought hard against British rule to protect his wild land.
There are many examples of the tribal community that teach us how to live in harmony with nature and the wealth of the forests that we have survived today is a loan to our tribals.
Come, let us express our respect for them.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who are doing some extraordinary work for the society.
Such works which appear normal at first sight but in fact, they have a deep impact on changing our mindset and changing the direction of the society.
A few days ago, I was studying about the farmer brother of Punjab, Guru Bachan Singh ji.
A common and hard-working farmer was the daughter of Guru Bachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Guru Bachan ji had told Vai that we will marry simplicity.
Whether it is life or other things, there is no need to spend anything.
Some things that may be difficult for the family of the daughter but you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a straightforward farmer, what he had said, the condition that he had laid down is the true strength of our society.
Guru Bachan Singh ji told him that you promise me that now you do not burn the slaughter in the field.
You can imagine how big social power is in it.
Guru Bachan Singh ji feels very valuable but he shows how large his personality is and we have seen that there are many such families in our society that transform the individual occasion into the context of social interest.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh has set a similar example in front of us.
I have read about another village Kallar Majra in Punjab, which is with Nabha.
Congratulations to brother Guru Bachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to the people of Kallar Majra and those places which make their best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You all are moving forward the Indian heritage of a healthy lifestyle as a true successor.
Just as the drop-up lake is formed, small awareness and activity and positive work always play a very important role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it is said in our scriptures: : : : This means, O God, all around the three worlds, in water, in water, in the earth, in the sky, in the fire, in the wind, in medicine, in the vegetation, in the vegetation, in the unconsciousness, in the entire universe.
Peace be established everywhere in life, in heart, in me, in stars, in particles of the world.
India has a special significance for 11th November this year as the end of the First World War 100 years ago on 11th November, that is, the end of 100 years, that is, the end of a century of heavy devastation and loss of lives will also be completed.
The First World War for India was an important event.
If it was said in the true sense then we would not have been able to take any action directly with that war.
Nevertheless, our soldiers fought with bravery and played a very big role, sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that when there is talk of war, it is not behind anyone.
Our soldiers have shown their bravery in the inaccessible areas and in the odd conditions.
The only objective behind them was the restoration of peace.
In the First World War, the world saw the destruction of destruction.
As per the estimates, about one crore soldiers and almost so many citizens lost their lives.
With this, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Today, peace and harmony does not mean to be a war.
From terrorism to change in environment, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, the matter of our Ishaan India is something or the other.
The natural beauty of the Northeast is unique and the people there are very talented.
Our Ishaan Bharat is now known for its best work.
Ishaan India is an area which has made great progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food systems.
You will be happy to know that this award given for the best policy formulation in this field is like Oscar in the field.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by leaving behind the 51 eminent policies of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, the end of October is on.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
I will urge you all to take care of yourself in these festivals, take care of your health and also take care of the interests of the society.
This festival will also become an opportunity in your life to move forward in the form of a mission, to take a strong pledge.
Your progress is a major part of the progress of the country.
The progress of your country will be the same.
My best wishes to you all.
