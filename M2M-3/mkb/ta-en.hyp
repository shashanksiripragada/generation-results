Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
In particular, it is not that some Indian community participates in it.
Now many governments, citizens and social movements are also celebrating Diwali with full enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
In a way, we can also say that there is a country of India.
Friends, There is an attraction of festival tourism in the world.
There are many possibilities for festival tourism.
Whatever the festival of Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, we should share them.
In our country, various festivals are held in every state and in every region, of which people from other countries have a lot of country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in expanding the festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we had decided in the voice of the last Mann Ki Baat that we would do something different on this island.
All of us had also said that on this Diwali, we will celebrate India's women's power and its achievements, that is, we will respect the monks of the country of India or not
In a few days, many stories inspired by social media have begun to pour out.
Ramesh ji has said that his mother is his power in the Namo App.
In the year 1990, when my father's time was, my mother accepted the gold to maintain five children.
Today, we are sitting in good work only five brothers.
Ramesh ji, also bow to your mother.
On the other hand, Kidhika Swami, who is very engaging in the tweet, has said that Major Khushboo Kanwar is the mothers of India.
For the sake of Kavita Divadi Ji, the daughters of India are her daughters and she is giving her power.
She is very proud that her daughter is sweet to painting.
He has also received good values in the CLAT legislative entrance examination.
People are sharing such information.
Definitely read, inspire, share something in your presence, like those who are present in it, I salute all these monks of India on this occasion.
We are aware that the foundation for this was laid by him in the 17th century.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November this year, the 550th birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is spread not only in India but also throughout the world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are living in many countries of the world, they are completely dedicated to Guru Nanakdev's high objectives.
I can't forget that I went to Gurudwara in Venguar and Tehran.
There are many things about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji but they will need a lot of parts of Mann Ki Baat.
Nanakdev ji believed to have served above all.
Guru Nanakdev ji thought that selfless service was invaluable.
He made a strong voice against social evils like evil and acted.
The news of Shri Guru Nanakdev ji spread all over the world.
He was one of those who had travelled a lot during his time.
He went to many places and wherever he goes, he will win the hearts of all through his simple work.
Guru Nanakdev ji had made several important visits to the time, which is known as Udasi.
He took the messages of harmony and equality from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from all directions and from all places to the people of sovereignty and saints.
The renowned sacred Shankardev Ji of Assam is also believed to have inspired him.
He traveled to the holy land of Haridwar.
It is said that Guru Bagh, a sacred place of Kashi, had stayed in Gurudwara by Shri Guru Nanakdev.
He also visited pilgrimages like Rajgir and Gaya related to Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has travelled to Sri Lanka in the south.
During his visit to Pithar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev Ji had solved the water conservation there.
We all remember that a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb is in Pithar, which was dedicated to him.
At one time Guru Nanak ji had travelled in the north, Kashmir and nearby areas.
This has led to a strong link between the Sikhs and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Dev ji visited Tibet and the people from there accepted him as a Guru.
He is also bowing to the country of Uzbekistan.
As part of his pilgrimage, he has visited large numbers of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He took place in the minds of millions of people, who followed his teachings with full compassion and followed it even today.
A few days ago, government ambassadors from about 85 countries went from Delhi to Amritsaras.
There they had visited the Golden Temple and all this took place on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
On this day, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji, the iron man of India, was born and he was the sutradar who connected the country with oven.
Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to integrate the people, while he had the power to raise consciousness among those who had differences.
He's really the man of Detail, capable of looking at the authenticity.
Besides, he is an expert in organizational activities.
The art of making plans and formulating strategies has been given to him.
When we learn about Sardar ji's work, we can know how strong his plan was.
Thousands of delegates were coming from all over the country to attend the Congress conference in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the arrangements of the conference were imposed on Sardar ji.
He used this opportunity to improve the city's water network.
He assured that water conservation should not happen to anyone.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to make kadraf bags.
At the same time, a substantial increase in garland sales was also ensured.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitutional Council.
He was of great significance to determine fundamental rights, which led to no inequality on the basis of caste and religion.
Friends, As the country's first Home Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji won the success of a brilliant and devoted effort to unite the kingdoms in a big and golden piece of history.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, we only talk about his contribution to some specific areas in integrating the nation.
As soon as Sardar Patel received this news, he did not delay for a moment but immediately acted in a serious way.
After his order, the three-shovel was immediately released, while watching, the evil desire of the opponent to capture Lakshadweep was soiled.
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked the brothers to ensure that all necessary assistance is being made for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
This is an attractive tourist spot.
I am confident that all of you will visit its beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the statue of unity was dedicated to the nation and the world to the memory of Sardar Shai on 31st October, 2018.
This is the world's largest statue.
This is a statue of two parts higher than the statue of the Freedom Goddess in America.
Every Indian is proud of being the highest statue of the world.
The head of every Indian is proud.
I am glad that more than 26 lakh tourists have come to see the statue of unity in the same year.
Thus, every day 8,500 people have seen the pride of unity.
It is observed that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji has faith and dedication in the hearts of these people.
Now there are several attractive centres like Chapathiyala Garden, Batamboochi Garden, Wildlife, Children's Nutrition Park, Unity Nursery. This has led to the development of the economy of the region, people get new opportunities for employment.
Friends, This statue of unity can be a testimony for all the states and for tourism for the country.
We all are witnesses of how one place can become a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There are people from our country and people from abroad.
A number of such organizations are developing one after the other, transportation, housing, guides and environment friendly organisations.
I also urge you to extract your invaluable time and see the statue of unity.
But at the same time, I reiterate my request to every Indian who travels and his family to visit at least 15 places in India and stay there at night.
Friends, You must be aware that from 2014, on 31st October, we are observing the nation's unity day.
This day gives us the message of saving the price of unity, unity and security of our country.
On 31st October, every year, unity is being organised.
It will include all sections of the society and every section of the society.
In this way, this drive is being implemented not only for the body but also for the inner and friends, for the unity of India and to touch new heights.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel ji had linked the country with the vision of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a friend in our lives and in a diverse country like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every stage, at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very positive and awakening to strengthen the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look around us, there will be many examples of those who are involved in sustainable activity to develop mutual harmony.
But sometimes, the efforts of the society, its contribution, and the memories, are very quickly disappearing.
Friends, I am very remembered in September 2010 and the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict on Ramjanmabhumi issue.
But after the verdict on Ramjanmabhoomi, the then government, political parties, social organisations, society, representatives of all religions and saints and saints had made a very quiet and middle opinion.
This is an attempt to reduce the pressure in the environment.
Those days, these moments remind us of our duties.
This is an example of how much strength is unity for the nation.
He is also the gods who have experienced the benefits of 125 crore Indians.
But there is a pleasant experience and a pleasant experience.
I heard, why shouldn't I share with you, I'm sharing.
Just imagine that the world's highest battlefield is 50-60 degrees below the temperature.
There is only one name in the air.
In such a opposite situation, living within such challenges is not a little less than any mighty act.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders but are also organising the Clean Siachen Movement.
I convey my greetings and thanks to the people of the country for this wonderful duties of the Indian Army.
It is difficult to eat anything in the severe winters there.
In such a situation, it is a very important task to analyze and make arrangements for garbage.
There is such an environmental system here that lives in rare species of animals like snow and there are rare species of animals like ibex and brown bears.
My dear countrymen, festivals are not going to create a new awareness in the lives of all of us.
Moreover, on Deepawali, especially in every family, buying something new and bringing something from the market.
I had also said once that we should try to buy local goods.
If we get the necessary thing in our villages then what is the need to go to the regional level
If one thing is available at the regional level then what is the need to go to the district level
As much as we are trying to buy locally available goods, Gandhi will blossom himself as a great opportunity.
I reiterate my request to buy something or the other in the hands of our weavers, the clothes weavers and the things weavers weaving.
Besides conveying my best wishes to Deepawali, I insist that we will turn the local goods into more lucky people.
Through this, we should realise how important we can contribute to fulfill the dreams of Gandhiji.
Once again I convey my best wishes for this Diwali day.
On the day of Deepawali, we blew a variety of slaughter.
However, sometimes it is because of our deficiency.
It's hurt.
Therefore, while you protect yourself, I also urge you to celebrate the festivals.
My best wishes to Deepawali.
Thank you very much.
He is always ready to express his happiness and express his support to our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated the victory of the valour of Bharakram Parv.
We were reminded of the accurate attack in 2016, and our soldiers gave a strong response to the horrific insurgency war on our country.
Our soldiers were organising exhibitions at various places in the country to inform the citizens of the country, particularly the youth of our power.
See how capable we are, how our soldiers are saving our countrymen with their lives.
One day such as the Parakram Mountain reminds our youth of the glorious tradition of our soldiers.
Moreover, it inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, a brave Rajasthan.
Now it has been decided that those who are trying to contribute to the peace and development environment of our country, our soldiers will give them a strong answer.
India has always committed its commitment to maintain peace and dedication.
In the two world wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh of our soldiers have sacrificed their great sacrifices for peace, even in those wars we have no connection.
This is also a mighty act in the direction of peace that our soldiers have understood.
Our brave soldiers have been wearing blue helmets for years and have played an important role in maintaining peace in the world.
My dear countrymen, things related to heaven will always be different.
In this way, it is not surprising that the Indian Air Force has shown its strength in the sky and attracted the attention of every citizen.
They have given us a security feeling.
On the occasion of Independence Day, one of the most eager and eager expectations of the people of the march is air adventure in which our Air Forces will showcase their strength with depression.
We are celebrating Air Force Day on 8th October.
In 1932, our Air Force, which had launched a small scale with six aircrafts and 19 Air Force personnel, has now been among the most courageous and powerful air force of the 21st century.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the Air Force personnel and their families who have provided their service to the nation.
In the year 1947, when Pakistanis launched an unprecedented attack, our Air Forces decided to save Sri Nagar from the attackers and landed the arms and war bases of Indian soldiers at the right time in the battlefield.
The Air Force responded strongly to the enemies in 1965.
Tell me, who will be those who don't know about the 1971 Bangladesh freedom struggle
In the Tiger Hill area, the enemies were hiding all nights and rained them and dragged them into the soil.
The country is grateful to the Air Force for the excellent work of our Air Force personnel be it rescue and relief operations or disaster arrangements.
Their feelings are marvellous to tackle all the calamities ranging from storms, rains, floods and forest islands and help the people.
Air Forces have taken an example in creating gender equality in the country and have opened the doors of every department for women.
Now there is a transformation of women joining the Air Force with short-term work and I had announced this year from the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
We can proudly say that not only men's strength but also the contribution of women's power to the Indian Army's military forces is increasing.
Women are powerful, but now they are also armed.
My dear countrymen, in the past, one of our navy officers faced the struggle of Abhilash Tomi and Live Sawa.
The whole country was concerned about how to save Tommy.
You know Abilash Tommy is a very courageous officer.
As an individual, he was the first Indian to travel around the world without any modern technological help.
Over the last 80 days, he was moving forward without decreasing his speed in the sea to participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.
He was a magnificent example of courage, commitment and valour, and a few days ago, when I came out of the ocean, I spoke to him with a telephone conversation.
I have already met Tommy.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tomy, his courage, his valour, his perspective, his fighting power will definitely inspire our youth.
My dear countrymen, every child of the country is aware of the importance of our nation on October 2.
There is another feature on 2nd October this year.
Now, for the years, we have organized several events across the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
The ideas of Gandhiji have inspired the entire world.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another important work of devotional field, and the people of the country should know this thing.
In 1941, Gandhiji started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle in 1945 was intensified, he prepared a compilation of these thoughts.
He put his views in front of the country on several issues such as the protection of the rights of respectable farming, farmers, villages and workers, cleanliness and the spread of education.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Everyone has experienced it in the most unique form of his personality.
Everyone was very important for the country and he made the feeling of being inevitable for every person.
It was his biggest contribution in the freedom struggle that turned it into a mass movement.
In the freedom struggle, all the departments of the society and all sections of the society had taken up their lives and joined themselves.
What is said in it, 'I give you a coffee sweet, whenever you feel doubtful, you're in yourselves', take this measure - whoever is poorer and weak, look at that man, remember his face, listen to your mind, listen to what you have to do, so ask your mind how much benefit the person will be.
This will brighten his life and future
My dear countrymen, this defence line of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the growing middle class people in the country, their growing economic power, their purchasing power...
If we go to buy something, can we remember the dam for an hour
Could you remember that defence belly
Happiness in whose face
Who will benefit directly or indirectly if you buy
If it benefits the poor, then my joy shall be doubled.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind that in the days to come when we all buy something, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, whenever we buy everything, let us remember that those people of our country who have sweated to make this thing, who have invested their money, who have sown their capabilities in it, all of them should get some benefit.
He might have been unaware of how it would happen, but this happened and India got freedom.
Today, we can see how this small work can contribute to my country's economic development and the power to fight against poverty for the poor.
But today, this is the real patriotism and I believe that this will be the correspondence we can give to the field.
He said that all these doors are very hardly weighed and every work of them should be used.
And it came to pass, that, behold, there was learned in the land, and in the people of the land, and in every corner of the Holy Ghost, which was a small idol.
We are going to celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastri along with a devotional land.
His anger, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, is a symbol of his individuality.
As a result of his unhealthy commitment to the nation, he was able to give a mantra to the country's soldiers and farmers in less than a year and a half.
Millions of people have joined themselves in this movement and I have got an opportunity to serve with Ambedkar School children in Delhi.
The foundation stone for that school was the respected Baba Saheb.
All kinds of people from all over the country were engaged in this service on 15th.
Organisations have also contributed with great enthusiasm in this regard.
Scholars, college students, national students, national welfare programmes, youth organisations, media groups and corporations all served in a big way.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those who want cleanliness for their contribution.
Let's hear a telephone call.
But if you hadn't been telephone to tell you how it was after the toilets, you would have been able to see the attention of the people associated with this movement.
I express my gratitude to you in a special way.
My hearted countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a success story not only in our country but also in the world and everyone is talking about it.
This time, India is organising the world's largest Swachhta Conclave in an unprecedented manner in history.
At the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Conference, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention, Health Ministers and Departmental experts from all over the world will jointly share their experiments and experiences on Swachhta.
The Closing Ceremony of Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Conference will be held on 2nd October this year at the inauguration of the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations.
There are many clauses in the Constitution of Babasaheb Ambedkar to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993, in accordance with this vision.
The commission has been set up and completed in a few days.
This Commission is not only protecting human rights but also working to improve human dignity.
The close leader of our hearts, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, and human rights, is not our stranger principle.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the principle of the Vedic era Sarve Bhawandu Sukin: is engraved.
The Commission has created a comprehensive awareness on human rights, but has contributed commendablely to prevent its misuse.
This 25-year visit has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence to the people of India.
It provides a healthy society, a reliable function for the best democratic values.
Today, along with the work of human rights at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions are also operating.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and follow it, this is the source of progress for all, for all.
My dear countrymen, in the month of October, Jai Prakash Narayan ji and Rajmata Vijayraje Scindia ji are starting the birth centenary.
All these dignitaries have inspired us and remember them.
On 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Ji comes and I will talk about it in the next Mann Ki Baat but if I want to mention it today, for a few years, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Ji, on 31st October, the celebration of unity is being organised in every small town and villages of India.
This year, we have to make efforts to organise this drive for unity in our villages, regions, cities and cities.
The movement for unity is the best way to think about Sardarji because he worked for the unity of the country throughout his life.
I urge all of you to strengthen our efforts to unite every section of the society and every section of the country through the Run of Unity on 31st October, this will be a special tribute to him.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today, the entire country is celebrating Raksha Bandhan.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious day.
Raksha Bandhan has taken the lead in love and confidence between the mother and the brother.
This festival is also a great example of social harmony for centuries.
There are many special stories in the history of the country associated with the hope of the people of two different regions or religions.
After a few days, Janmashtami is coming.
Throughout the environment, elephants, horses, palanquins, Jai Kanhaiyalal ki and Govinda-Govinda jewellery are swimming.
The joy of Sri Krishna's devotion is Aladhi.
Our youth would have been making arrangements for Teh-Handi in many parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen for Raksha Bandhan and Janmashtami.
My heartfelt gratitude to Sister Sinmai for introducing a special thing.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, we are celebrating Sanskrit Day on the occasion of Chiravan Purnimi.
I convey my best wishes to all those who have dedicated themselves to this great treasure and bringing them to the common man.
There is a significance for every language.
India is proud of Tamil language as the oldest language in the world
Similarly, the Indians and all of us are proud that from the Vedic period to today, cultural language and wisdom have contributed greatly.
The Gnana Manchalanjayam, which is linked to every aspect of life, is blamed in the language of Sanskrit and its literature.
Be it science, technology, agriculture, well-being, aeroplane, architecture, architecture, management, economy or environment...
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoka district of Karnataka still use culture as a case language.
Thousands of words are in Sanskrit, the possibilities for the creation of 200 introductions i.e. prefix, 22 sequences i.e. Sufix and society's countless words
Therefore, any kind of hot feeling or matter can be described exactly.
We always remember Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji.
We celebrate Teachers Day throughout the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I convey my best wishes for science, education and dedication to teachers.
My dear countrymen, this season has brought the expectations of our hardworking farmers.
It is natural that there is more rainfall than other places.
We all have seen how bad the lives of the people have been affected by the severe floods of Kerala.
Although we cannot fully afford their sorrow, I am confident that 125 crore Indians stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this sad moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity should recover quickly.
Everyone is determined how to reduce the problems of the people of Kerala and how to share their sorrow.
We know that the soldiers were the heroes of the rescue work in Kerala.
They did not leave any effort to save the victims of the flood.
Air Force, Navy, Land Force, Border Security Force, Central Industries Security Force and Expedition have contributed to this movement.
In particular, I would like to mention the hard work of the NDRF Surats, the National Disaster Management Force.
Yesterday, the festival of Om is celebrated, we urge the nation to give strength to the country, particularly Kerala, to rise quickly from the impact of this disaster and to the development journey of Kerala.
Once again, I assure all the people of the country and the people of Kerala and all those affected by disasters all over the country that you have the strength and help in this painful situation throughout the country.
My dear countrymen
This time I was watching the suggestions for Mann Ki Baat.
I had to see what the people of the country have written more about - that is, the beloved Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
Kirti of Kaziaabad, Swadi Vatsa from Soniba, Praveen, brother of Kerala, Dr.
MyGov and Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi have also asked me to talk about the diversity of Atal ji's life and Akhilesh Pandey of Bihar's Kadihar.
On August 16, the country and the world heard the time of Atal ji and saddled.
He broke the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago.
In a way, he had been away from extreme politics for the past decades.
He didn't get a place in the news, he lived away from public life.
The country and the world have seen that the New Year was a great gap, but after the 16th August, the country and the world have seen that this decade has not made any gap in the minds of the common Indians.
The love, jealousy and grief that Atal has enhanced for them in the country shows his vast personality.
Over the past few days, Atal ji's most important dimensions have emerged before the nation.
People recall him as the best Member of Parliament, the best speaker, the best speaker, the Prime Minister of the people, and remembered him.
The nation will always be thankful to them for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
But today I want to talk about another dimension of Atal ji's broader personality and touch it, the benefits of India will be very beneficial in the days to come due to the political culture that Atal ji gave to India, the efforts to transform it into it and the efforts made to formally build it.
It's sure.
India will always be grateful for the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003.
This change has led to two significant changes in the politics of India.
Firstly, the number of ministers of the States should be only 15 percent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly.
Secondly, according to the anti-party law, he increased the level of one-third of the earlier members and made two-thirds members.
Moreover, clear norms have been framed for ensuring the postponement of members of the party.
For decades, there has been a political culture that has created a large number of cabinets in India, and these major cabinets were formed not to share the work, but to maintain political leaders.
Atal ji changed this situation.
This activity saved money and expenditure.
Moreover, efficiency has also improved.
This was possible only by a prophet like Atal ji, and a healthy tradition in our political culture started living.
Atal ji is a real patriot.
During his tenure, the change was made when the budget was submitted.
Previously, the budget was presented at 5 p.m. on the lines of the British.
In 2001, Atal ji made the time to submit the budget from 5 in the evening to 11 in the morning.
Similarly, today you have been watching the discussions on conducting elections in the country with the central government and state governments at the same time.
On this occasion, when we are committed to fulfilling his dream of a full and prosperous India, I dedicate to Atal Ji on behalf of us.
In the speech of the Parliament, it is spoken about the confrontation, crushing and adjournment, but if something good happens, it does not speak much about it.
A few days ago, the Monsoon Session of Parliament was completed.
You will be happy to note that the capacity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the capacity of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
All parliamentarians tried to make the monsoon session more useful than party differences, resulting in the passage of 21 bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 bills in the Rajya Sabha.
This Monsoon Session of the two Houses will always be remembered for social justice and youth welfare.
Several important bills were passed in this session for the youth and backward classes to fear the interest.
This initiative will help in achieving the objective of social justice.
The Amendment Bill was also passed to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
The Act will further protect the interests of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
Moreover, there will be confidence in the minds of the underprivileged and preventing the evils of the guilty.
No civil society can bear the injustice committed against women.
The country is not ready to tolerate the slaves of sexual oppression
The Parliament, therefore, has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and has provided strict punishment.
You might have read a few days ago that a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh, had tried a case within two months and sentenced two offenders, including sexual penalties.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh, completed the investigation in just five days and punished the criminals.
Even in Rajasthan, the courts have expedited judgments in such cases.
The Act will enable them to prevent crimes committed against women and girls.
When we move ahead with the welfare of the country, we can transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the exploited and the deprived.
During the monsoon session this time, a special model was set up together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country.
Today, the attention of millions of people is from the Asian Games in arda.
Every day in public newspapers, televisions, news and social websites, what Indian soldiers have won medals.
Asian sports competitions are being held now.
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
I convey my best wishes to the sportspersons who are participating in the coming events.
India's sportspersons have done excellent achievements in the sportspersons, particularly in the shooting competition and war competition, but our sportspersons have also won medals in such unprecedented fields like Whushu competition and boat competition.
These are not medals - the evidence of the hopes and dreams of Indian sports and sportspersons...
Our women are also present in the growing number of medals for the country. This is a very positive sign.
As much as the medal winners, the young sportspersons will include our youth under the age of 15-16.
My best wishes to all on National Sports Day.
We all have seen building houses and buildings with bricks, but about 1200 years ago, you can imagine that a large mountain has been carved as a very special, broad and magnificent temple in Ellora of Maharashtra, but it has happened.
India's land has been an engineering testing platform.
Several engineers have emerged in India, who have achieved what they cannot imagine, have given examples that are known as miracles in the engineering world.
Millions of farmers and common people are benefiting from the Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the banks of the river Tagore.
He has been devoted to these parts of the country and the country also gives him respect in a very hearty manner.
In his memory, we are following engineers day on September 15.
On the path shown by him, engineers of our country have made a separate stamp all over the world.
While speaking about the wonders of the engineering world, it reminds me of a terrible earthquake in Kutch region of Gujarat in 2001.
When I was working there as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I had to meet a kiss who crossed the age of 100.
He was listening to me, calling my house to be a park in the Par-Katch area.
He added that this house has seen three landslides.
I have met three landslides.
I have realized them in this house itself.
But there is no impact anywhere.
Several centuries ago, the engineers of that period had imbibed how many buildings were built in accordance with the regional environment, so that the people were able to live safely.
When we commemorate the Engineers Day today, we have to think for the future.
The world is suffering from natural disasters.
We will be in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, we will speak openly, we will take the country forward through our minds, we will be united.
With this spirit, my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
Let's meet again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
My dear countrymen, salute me.
Although the vastness and diversity of India is on the one hand, sometimes the rain also shows its distinction.
But why should we reduce the rain
As a result, sometimes nature expresses its anger.
Therefore, it should be our responsibility to be nature lovers, to protect nature and to preserve nature, that is why there will be a deterioration in the gifts of nature itself.
A natural disaster incident that took place a few days ago attracted the attention of the whole world and driven humanity.
It usually takes a few hours to enter the cave and come out.
But the sports of the rules were different.
After they went far inside the cave, due to a sudden shutdown the cave's doorstep had a lot of water accumulated.
They stopped the way out.
They stayed on a small rock inside the cave, not for two days, but for 18 days.
You just imagine what the situation that those youngsters have to spend every moment while they die in front of their eyes.
On the one hand, they were wounded in large numbers, on the other hand, the entire humanity was uniting and expressing the humanity of God.
People from all over the world had been praying to bring these children out safely.
The parents will not be sorry or the eyes of the mother will not grow.
Beyond such difficult situations, the world was surprised to see that the boys had not left the faith in a dark cave filled with water.
This happens to us that when humanity stands together, miracles occur.
But it is necessary that we be calm and strong to target and work for it.
In the past few days, the beloved poet of our country, Niraj ji, left us all.
He has a specialty - confidence, self-confidence and mind.
The months of July-August are the most important months for the farmers and all the youth.
Because these months are the peak season of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Sathya come out of school and join colleges.
If the months of February-March are for examinations, question papers and answers, the months of April-May are enjoyed in the vacation and the results of the examination are to decide the direction of travelling in life and what work should be done.
In the month of July, the concentration of the youth goes away from questions and goes on cut-off standards, this is a very important period.
The attention of the students is going away from the house to the school.
Students leave the roof of the parents and join them under the roof of the professors.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about starting college life.
For the first time, when we leave the house and leave the village and leave a safe environment and start drive themselves away.
For the first time, all these youngsters have come out to leave their homes and create a new direction for their lives.
Many students will be involved in their colleges, some will come together.
Whatever I want to say to you, be calm, experience your inner mind in life, there is no doubt that books are essential, it is important to read, while making yourself the nature of looking for new things.
There is a special value for old friends.
Children's friends are very valuable, while selecting new friends and pursuing friendship is a big intellectual step.
Some new things can be learned, some new skills, new languages...
My best wishes to all the youngsters who have started a new lamp.
Talking about the college season, it was reported that Ashram Chaudhary, a student of the poorest family in Madhya Pradesh, had achieved success through the difficult challenges of life.
He has been tested in the first attempt of the AIIMS hospital medical examination.
His father has served as a sanitation worker and served his family.
I convey my best wishes to him for his success.
The students of such a poor family have achieved due to their untiring efforts and motivation by crossing the bad conditions.
Their achievements conceptualize us, the father of Kushi from Nagpur is a school bus driver, Karthik's father is a policeman from Haryana, Ramesh Sahu's father of Jharkhand is working on brick sweetheart. The student Rameshekoot is selling sports goods at the festival.
Similarly, Anushka Banda, a disabled woman from Kutka, was suffering from the spinal muscular atrophy since her birth...
All of them, with the help of consciousness, have struck the obstacles in their minds, have achieved the world's return.
If we had seen around us, we would have known many such examples.
And some good thing that walks in some corner of the country fills me with strength and inspires me.
This is the meaning of life when I talk about these youngsters, I am taking care of you.
I would like to invite the songs of the heavens and the songs of the earth to the light of the poem. I would like to drive the mountains with the songs that I would like to remove the evil of the people from the flowers.
My dear countrymen, my eyes went on a news a few days ago, it was written in it that two youths had fulfilled the dream of Modi.
While studying it in detail, it was learned how today our youth are trying to transform the lives of the common man using technology intelligent and positive manner.
I was interacting with the Indian youth in the city of San Jose, once known as the centre of technology.
I urge them to take time to think about how they can use their skills for India.
I urge you to enjoy the use of knowledge and talent from abroad to the country.
Two technologists from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji, have taken a new initiative by accepting this challenge.
Using their skills, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together created the SmartGaun App and Intellectual Villages App.
This App connects the villagers with the world and provides for any information and information in their mobile phones.
All the residents of Rae Bareli, the Chairman of the Panchayat, the District Judge and the district rulers have created awareness about the use of this app.
If you look at this event in a sympathetic manner, we should keep in mind that these youngsters are living in the United States and are living in the middle of lifestyle and emotions, even if they leave India several years ago, they have sympathetically knew their village, understand the challenges and are emotionally connected to their villages.
This is the reason why we have been able to understand the needs of the village.
The thirst to achieve something for their motherland is natural in every Indian.
But sometimes, because of the compulsions of time, the compulsions and circumstances, this feeling is slightly deteriorating in it, then this feeling is dragging itself towards the past days.
Bandarpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
On Adi Ekadashya, about 15-20 days ago, Varkari i.e. pilgrims are walking along with the teeth for a pilgrimage to Bandarpur.
This journey is called Vari, in which lakhs of devotees participate.
Gnanaswar swamis and Dukaram swamis are walking towards Bandarpur by singing, singing, singing, singing, singing, singing, singing and singing rhetoric.
Pilgrims come there to visit Bhagwan when they are called Vitoba or Bandurangan.
Vital Bhagwan protects the interests of the poor, the denied and the victims.
Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are filled with hard work and devotion.
Going to Vittoba temple in Bandarpur, its glory, beauty and spiritual joy are all very different experiences.
I would like to appeal to the lovers of Mann Ki Baat that if you get the opportunity, you should once enjoy Bunderpur Warri.
Innumerable great personalities like Gyaneshwar Swamis, Namdevas, Eknath, Ramdas Swamis, Dukaram Swamis are still being guided by the common people of Maharashtra.
The tradition of these greats is inspiring every corner of India to fight against hypocrisy.
We get a great message about the importance of Parud songs, the importance of harmony, love and brotherhood.
As the great tradition of the great majestics, who devoted themselves to the feet of God, was in our country, as well as the great men who dedicated themselves to the wrists of Mother India, showed them their lives.
Such a great man is Lokmanya Tilkar, who has laid down a seal in the minds of many Indians.
While we celebrate the birth anniversary of Tilak on 23rd July, we observe his commemoration day on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilkar is full of adventure and self-confidence.
He was filled with the power and innovation that directly cited the mistakes of the British rulers.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very attracted by Lokmanya Tilkar.
When Lokmanya Tilkar died on 1st August 1920, Patel ji promised to build a memorial to him.
When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, he immediately selected Victoria Carden, named after the UK ueen, to establish the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak.
Inside, the British discovered this act, so the ruler refused to allow it.
The most interesting thing is that Gandhijis addressing the opening ceremony said that after the assumption of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only received a good man but also a heart that has led to the construction of the statue of Tilakar.
My dear countrymen, the significance of this magnificent statue is that this magnificent statue is very rare in which he is seen in the shape of a chair in which self-respect is engraved under it.
I am shared with you about the years of the British.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilkar, there is a tradition of celebrating the Ganesh Festival socially.
It can be understood from this that our ancient heritage and our brave heroes of history still have a great attraction in our younger society.
Today, we can see the balls of worshipping the snakes in almost all the streets of many cities.
I would like to introduce a widespread campaign to celebrate the Ganesh celebrations of the environment loved Ganapati festival in every city and to be given awards and to the MyGov and the Narendra Modi App.
I will definitely take your views to the people.
Every Indian, goodwill and goodwill of development should reach.
This will build a New India.
On the same day i.e. on 23rd July, another son of Mother India was born after the birth of Tilkar.
He dedicated his life to the countrymen to breathe a free wind.
I am talking about Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Any young man of India will be inspired by these words: Revolution thirst remains in our hearts, we will look at the power of the flyers and these poems are sympathetic for many youngsters like Ashfakulla Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad.
Chandrasekhar Azad's courage, freedom candidate and his mindset inspired many youngsters.
Asad ji possessed his life, but did not bow to the foreign regime.
I had the greatest privilege of going to Alirajpur, the village of Chandrashekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again, I offer my memories to these two great saints of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilkar and Chandrasekhar Azad.
A few days ago, Hima Das, India's brave and farmer's daughter, won a gold medal in the 400-meter race in the World Championship Games in Finland.
Ekta Bayan, another woman in the country, has written to me through an e-mail from Indonesia, now she is preparing for Asian Games.
Ekta said in his power, "I am very proud that once the most important moment in the lives of the heroes, it is to hold the tri-flag in the hands of the world platform, and I have shown it.
Ekta, we are all proud of you.
You are proud of the country.
In Tunisia, Grand Prix has won the medals of Ektan Gold and Bronze in 2018 for Divyangjans.
It is his achievement that he had transformed the challenge of Divyangjan into a means of his success.
Due to the road accident in 2003, the lower part of Ekta Bayan ji's body was deteriorated, but he did not lose his heart, strengthened himself and took the target.
Yogesh Kadunia, a disabled person, has won the Gold in the Grand Preyl, the Gold Medal in Berlin City and along with Sundar Singh Kurjar ji has also won the Gold Medal in the Gold Medal in Berlin City.
I convey my best wishes to Ekta Bayan ji, Yogesh Kaduniya ji and Sundar Singh ji for their self-confidence and indefinite thirst.
You need to move forward, play more, enjoy.
Friends, My dear countrymen, in August, many events of history are full of celebrations but sometimes due to the climate, the diseases are also in the households.
My best wishes to you all for this month of August and several festivals that have been guided by the centuries to raise the spirit of patriotism for the well-being and well-being of all of you.
Once again, we must meet in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a historic cricket strike took place in Bangalore.
You all understand that I mention the test competition between India and Afghanistan.
It is a matter of pride to every Indian that this is the first international test deal with Afghanistan and the historic test deal with India.
The President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Khani, also made me a tag and said that the people of Afghanistan are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I express my gratitude to our Indian friends for building a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talents.
Rashid is a representative of the special features of Afghanistan.
This lamp will be unforgettable for everyone.
On one hand, I consider it special for some other reason, whether it is the first lamp, it is memorable.
The Indian team showed an exhibition to the whole world.
We can understand the character of sportspersons from this event.
It shows that sports is an excellent way to connect the world and bring out the skills and talents of our youth.
My best wishes to both the Indian and Afghanistan teams.
I am confident that in the future, like this, we will play with each other immediately and develop.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June, when we celebrated the fourth International Day of Yoga, the entire world joined it.
I was told that for the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga has been held in which women have performed large numbers of asanas.
In Ladakh's highest peaks, India and China's military personnel together learned Yoga.
Some soldiers learned Yoga in the vessel
Similarly, some soldiers learned Yoga at the snowy mountain peaks of Siachen.
Our soldiers of the Air Force, in the middle, performed Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth and despised everyone.
It is worth mentioning that they did not do it as they sat on the plane, and did it as they flew in the sky.
Yoga practices were conducted everywhere in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports grounds.
A scene of Ahmedabad touched the heart.
There, about 750 Divyangjan brothers and sisters were present at one place and joined together with Yoga and got the World Cup.
Without any control of caste, religion and geographical definition, Yoga has done the work of connecting all the people of the world and we have been living for centuries with the feeling of Vasudhaiva family and unity all over the world.
Moreover, people will make it a part of their lives.
We remember the doctors only when there is a problem
But on this day we celebrate the services, dedication and achievements of doctors, I express my gratitude to them.
Our doctors have made their marks all over the world because of their talents.
While it is efficient and hardworking in the medical industry, our doctors are well-known to solve complex medical problems.
India is a prosperous historical country as a day or a day that has not been a historic event.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is true that I am coming to Makhar on 28th.
You know why Kabirdasar had gone to Makhar.
Pilgrim Kabirdasar stressed on social unity, peace and brotherhood through his poems of poetry, poetry.
This was his goal.
In his works, this goal is to be seen and in the world of today it is equally conceptualized.
Behold, listen to his doha: Kabir Soi Beer Hai, Jo Jane Ber Beer, Jo Par Beer Na Janahi, So Ka Beer Man Beer.
Kabirdasar stressed on social harmony.
What does he say in another Doha...
There is a sin where there is jealousy and breastfeeding.
Besides, Jadi Na Bhuchsho Sadhu Ki, Bhuch Lejiye Gyan.
Do not ask the saints what their creed is, and seek wisdom among them.
His appeal to the people is to accept and respect the people with their knowledge and beyond caste religion.
His views have been influenced by centuries and even today.
Guru Nanak Dev ji - the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God.
Wherever he goes, there is a lot of support for social benefits.
Here, every caste, every section and every religion can come and eat food and introduce the cooking system of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
In 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated.
I want all of us to participate in it with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The India Freedom War is very long, wide, deep and full of many sacrifices.
There is another history associated with the state of Punjab.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 2019 is about 100 years, which is a demand for shameless humanity.
My dear countrymen, Raman Kumar ji of Rohini, Delhi and Dr.
Raman ji, first of all I express my gratitude to you.
I am happy to see your interest in the history of India.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji is the timely day of 23rd June.
In 1937, Dr.
In the name of the invitation given by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji and addressed the convocation of the Calcutta University in Bengal.
It is notable that this was the first time that the British had spoken in Bengal at the convocation ceremony at the Calcutta University during the reign of the British.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji was the first industrial minister of India and even more, he laid the foundation stone for India's industrial development and laid the foundation stone of India.
In the first industrial policy of Freedom India, which emerged in 1948, an indelible mark of his views and vision was emerged.
Dr.
The dream of Mukherjee is to make India self-reliant and self-reliant in every field.
While India is promoting big businesses, he also wanted to focus on MSMEs, handlooms, weaving and horticulture.
During the period from 1948 to 1950, he built the Board of Artisans, All Handloom Boards, Padars and Rural Industries Board to provide financial and institutional platforms for the overall development of small and medium industries.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee ji's contribution is.
He was convinced of the development of West Bengal.
As a result of his understanding, intellect and positive activity, a large part of Bengal is saved and part of India.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video conference.
Beyond the coffees, there was an opportunity to learn directly from them about the changes in life.
While knowing about an ordinary man... his simple words, his experience, the event about him, gave him an annually like a bright heart.
Women from far-flung villages are providing pension to passports of senior citizens in the villages through the Public Service Centre.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister has collected sita fruit and produced ice cream.
Like the Anjan Prakash of Jharkhand, millions of youngsters of the country are operating medicines as well as providing affordable medicines to the nearby villages.
School children from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste management at Tinkering Lab in their childhood.
I have been able to hear this programme more than the success of the government, the success of the common man, the power of the country, the power of the dreams of New India, the power of the mindset of New India.
Instead, there are some people in society - unless they talk about disappointment, unless they don't inspire unbelief, they go away until they don't seek the path of unity or the path of diversity.
In such a situation, when talking about the events in our lives with the common man, new hopes and enthusiasm, I do not consider it a success to the government.
The story of a young woman from a small village far-flung has become a motivation for 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-50 lakh people have joined this video bridge programme and you have done the work of providing new energy to me.
Once again I would like to thank you all.
If we look around us, I have always found the truth that somewhere or the other good thing will definitely be seen in our eyes.
There are people who understand good.
We can also face the aroma of goodness.
In the past, one thing attracted my attention and it was a very serious link.
On the one hand there are professionals and engineers, on the other hand there are agricultural brothers and sisters associated with agriculture.
The farmers have joined themselves in this thing, the schemes have been implemented, the farmers have made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Scientists and engineers trained the farmers through this Trust to teach new strategies of agriculture, to do organic farming, to cultivate one thousand other crops in the fields.
Today, they are not only comparing vegetables, they are selling their vegetables through this Trust and selling them for good prices and the farmers who produce cereals have also added them to it.
In another way, I am glad that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, engineers and technologists have left their circles and have linked themselves to the villages and have made their way to work together with the fields and crops.
Friends
Your young man is really conceptualized for any young man.
The other youth of the country will definitely visit their portal and take care of their work on their own and they will also be inspired to work in different fields of the society in their respective areas.
One nation, one tax is a dream for all the people of the country.
If anybody wants to appreciate the implementation of the same tax reform system then I would like to appreciate the same congratulations to the States within myself.
So far, 27 GST meetings have been held, various political fantasies are sitting in it, people from different states participate, states with different priorities participate
Before the implementation, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country, but now only one tax is being replaced.
The success of the GST currencies is a celebration of currency measures.
Since the arrival, the checkpoints have come to an end, the movement of goods is going on at a rapid pace, which will save time and there is considerable profit in the goods sector.
It will be the world's largest tax reform.
Normally, such a big reform, such a big country and such a big country, it was considered that it could take 5-7 years to completely establish it.
Within this, the biggest success is that only 125 crore people have achieved this success.
Congratulations to you.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Salute me.
Once again I have got the opportunity to meet you all through Mann Ki Baat.
I hope that all of you will remember that a group of six women commanders of the Indian Navy had travelled for several months.
They have travelled in various oceans and many seas and crossed about 22,000 marine distances.
This is the first time in the world.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet these women's gems and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate them for their valour, the pride of the navy and the dignity of the country, especially the women of India who are not in the world.
Who doesn't know the feeling of courage.
For centuries, the Everest peak has become a challenge to humanity and the vicious people have been facing this challenge.
On May 16, a group of five tribal students from an ashram school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra - Manisha Truve, Pramesh Ale, Umanand Madvi, Kavidas Kathmode and Vikas Soyam - climbed the highest peak of the world.
The students of the Ashram School started their training in August 2017 and were trained in Warda, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under the SHAURYA Mission Training Scheme.
Accordingly, at the Everest peak, they possessed the pride of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the students of Chandrapur and my young friends.
Accordingly, the 16-year-old Shivangi singer from India was the youngest Indian woman from Nepal to Everest.
Many congratulations to Shivangi.
The first father and daughter of India who touched the Everest peak will be associated with Ajit Bajaj ji and his daughter Daya.
Some young people are climbing the Everest peak.
On May 19, Sangeeta Behl ji climbed the Everest peak over 50 years.
Some of the climbers at the Everest peak have shown that they have talent and sense.
In the past, the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, according to the Swachh Ganga Abhiyan, a group of border police personnel climbed the Everest peak, but when they came down, they brought the dustbins into their hands.
This is a commendable thing, while in the context of cleanliness, this field gives them the brightness to the environment.
For years, people have climbed the Everest peak, many of whom have won.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these courageous soldiers, especially to women.
My dear countrymen, especially my dear young friends, I have not seen that when I had spoken about Fit India two months ago, there will be no such response.
All the sectors do not seem to have supported it.
When I talk about Fit India, I acknowledge that the country will be in the same way as we play in sports.
In social media, people share video related to fitness challenges, i.e. physical challenges, tackle each other and challenge each other.
Today everyone is coming together with this mission of Fit India.
Whether it is a film industry or a sports sector or a common man of the country or a military soldier or a school teacher, India will be determined to be all around.
I believe that tackling such challenges helps us to keep ourselves physical and inspire others to be physical.
Savi Yadav Ji, thank you for your telephone call.
It is true that the games played in the streets have become part of the life of every child, which are surrounding today.
In particular, these sports have been an important part of summer holidays.
At the time of breakfast, after having dinner, children will play for hours without any concern or concern.
In some of these sports, the entire family was able to participate and play.
The games ranging from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Kutch to Kamrupam have been part of the youth.
Yes, they might have been called by different names in different places.
For example, 7 stons, which is known as Lahori, Pittu, Sadolia, Digori and Sadodiya.
In these sports, we see unity and unity in the background of the diversity of our country.
One sports is known in different places and in different names.
I am from the state of Gujarat and I know about a game called Somal-Isto.
It is played in a 8-8 square square square square square with a leopard or pomegranate.
It was played in almost all the states.
It is called Saukapara in Karnataka, Atu in Madhya Pradesh, which is called Bhagidagali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Tayam in Tamil Nadu and Shangabo in Rajasthan.
I don't know however, in every state language, but only after playing, I realized that we were playing it too.
Is there anyone among us who don't cross the kitchen and the kitchen
It is known by various names in various parts of the country .
It is called Kottibilla or Karrabilla in Andhra, Kulibadi in Odisha and Viditalu in Maharashtra.
When everybody leaves the wind, when everybody plays, we can express the unique characteristics that we have.
You can see that many children are fond of crying, but when they play, they become very active.
They themselves express themselves, look deeper, the hiding childhood emerges in them.
Deciding the goals, how to achieve mindset, how to create a team spirit, how to help each other.
In the training programmes related to business management, I can see that our traditional sports are now being used for the development of humanity and development of mutual skills.
From children to elders, when everyone plays together, the gap of generations is that it disappears.
At the same time, we can understand our culture and traditions.
Many sports create awareness about society and environment.
Animation films can be produced, played in streets and silvers, they will also see these sports that appear towards our new generations, play and develop.
My dear countrymen, on June 5, India has officially organised World Environment Day celebrations.
This time BEAT PLASTIC POLUTION is a concept.
And I appeal to all of you that in this regard, we will take a decision to understand its importance and avoid the use of polythene and low quality plastics and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on the nature, on the wildlife and on our health.
Enter the Wed India 2018 World Environment Day website, and many suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner. See, know, try to adopt them in your daily life.
When there is heavy heat, when there is a flood, when there is no rain, when there is no unbearable cold, all become experts, world warming, environmental change etc.
Over the past few weeks, we have seen a storm in many parts of the country, a strong wind and a heavy rain in the country. This is not a natural weather.
These have also caused deaths.
All these are mainly the result of the change of climate change
Our culture and heritage have not taught us to fight with nature.
We have to live with nature and have to be associated with nature.
Gandhiji had taken this thing forward throughout his life and every step.
We will not only stop the middle of the tree but also provide a way to maintain it till it grows and grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
This is the message of Yoga and a harmonious society for unity, which the world has again experienced for the past few years.
Psychological generates through yoga, it always protects us like a father.
However, there is a feeling that it looks like their mother in children, mental peace becomes our sustainable friend.
The pride of Yoga continues to be our children, our brothers and our brothers, our brothers and the earth is our bed, and wisdom is our hungry.
If such qualities are one's friends, then the yogi will win over all kinds of fears.
Once again I invite all the nations to take forward the tradition of Yoga, to build a healthy, happy and harmonious nation.
Today, on 27th May, the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
I salute Panditji.
In May, he was associated with each other, he was Veer Savarkar.
In the same month of May 1857, our citizens expressed their strength against the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers gathered together against injustice and expressed their sorrow.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, the 1857 incident had been described as a riot or a soldier's riot.
In fact, this is not just an attempt to reduce the incident but to humiliate our self-pride and self-pride.
In 1857, Veer Savarkar, who wrote without fear of being a first war of independence.
Together with Savarkar, many freedom fighters celebrated its 50th anniversary in India House in London.
He is an expert in handling both arms and weapons.
We usually salute Veer Savarkar for his bravery and his struggle against British imperialism
But apart from all this, he has always strengthened the wonderful poet, social reformist, harmony and unity.
I remember the words of our beloved respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee about Savarkar Ji.
He was a poet of understanding and was a brave revolutionary.
I convey my best wishes for the bright future of these women's sacrifices full of aspirations and expectations.
If you are determined to achieve something then you can achieve success by crossing all the obstacles
Considering the dreams of others, the story of some of them who dedicate themselves to fulfil them is T.
Prakash Rao belongs to him.
You will be surprised to know that today the poorest person selling tea is taking education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He provides all the facilities for education, health and food to all the children coming to school.
I congratulate Prakash Rao ji for his untiring hard work, his temptation and illumination in the lives of the poor children and giving him a new direction.
He has removed the darkness in his life.
Who does not know the scripture of Damaso Ma Jyotirgamaya
But if there is a person who has done it then he will be able to do it.
His life is a concept for all of us, society and the entire country.
There may be such a motivation around you.
In the next few days, they will also wait for the arrival of Janyachandra.
I am confident that all of you will celebrate the day of Egypt with great enthusiasm and the children will be specially awarded the Egypt Day.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
The 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in this.
You can imagine what kind of environment will be there when thousands of sportspersons are participating from all over the world.
If there is an atmosphere of enthusiasm, expectations, motivation, aspirations, aspirations and aspirations, can anyone be affected
..India has achieved an unprecedented achievement.
Winning the medals is a matter of pride for the winners but it is a matter of pride for the entire country and for the people of the country.
Encouraging and motivation smiles.
We all mix together with one feeling.
I have no words to express this feeling.
But I would like to share with you what these sportspersons have told me.
For the first time, many things have been done in this regard.
This time all the warriors who participated in the Commonwealth Games have won medals.
Manika Bhadra has won medals in all the sports he has played.
He is the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in the Table Tennis Single.
India has received a lot of gold shooting competition.
India's only Para Power Lifter to win the medal in the Chatchin Chaudhary Commonwealth Games.
Moreover, if the competition was special this time, most of the winners were women.
Whether it is Squash, be it square, be it square, be it square, be it square, the shooting competition, the women's heroines played very well and showed their talent.
The final competition of the Bhup Phool is to be held by two Indian vessels - Saina Nehwal and B.
V.
It took place between Sindhu.
I was urging you to join Fit India and come to the leadership.
I am glad that people have joined it with great enthusiasm.
Several people have written letters to show their support for this, sharing important aspects of their sex and Fit India information in the social media.
Sashikanth Bhonsley shared his film in the swimming pond and wrote that my body is my weapon, water is my own, swimming is my world.
Do you know what Ruma Godnath has written I feel happy and healthy after morning walking
For me, physical smoke was mixed with smoke and when we are happy, we have to smoke.
After seeing all these things, it is good that many well-known people have been inspiring our youth in a very interesting way for Fit India.
Akshay Kumar, a film star, has welcomed a video in Twitter.
His other video is also popular, in which he can be seen playing with the people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences with Fit India efforts.
Your city, your village, your area, your school, your college, all the elderly people, men and women should make efforts to connect with Yoga.
You must have been deep in the thinking of how to experience holidays and where to go.
Today I invite you to a new work
I can see many youngsters spend their time to learn something new.
The significance of training in the summer is increasing, youngsters are engaged in search of this thing, training is a new experience.
Outside four walls, there is an experience of living in a new dimension by crossing the records and computers.
My young friends, I urge you to do a special training.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, be it the Department of Sports, Human Resource Development and the Department of Drinking Water Resources, have jointly organised a Swachh Bharat Summer Training 2018.
Go to MyGov website and register yourself to participate in Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I am confident that our youth will take this campaign for cleanliness further.
Definitely send your information, send photographs, and welcome the video.
Come on
We will have an opportunity to learn new experiences during this vacation.
A few days ago, Kut News was showing a thing about some of the youth of Delhi and they are doing the service of teaching the poor children.
These youngsters have ended a massive campaign to educate the street children and children living in slums in Delhi.
This innovative work was started because of the condition of children who were begging on the streets or slaughtering in the streets.
Initiated with 15 children in the slums near the Gita colony of Delhi, this movement is connecting 2000 children in 12 places in the capital today.
Youth, teachers and teachers, who have joined themselves with this movement, have been working for them for two hours in their daily routine and are trying to transform society.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers of the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have become a source of conception for the farmers across the country.
Their integrated efforts have not only enriched their position but also the future of their region.
In Bhageshwar, Uttarakhand, particularly small pieces of pulses, corn and parli are cultivated.
Being a mountainous region, the farmers did not get the right price for these
They formed a cooperative system in the village of Munnar, where they built a factory to produce biscuits.
Considering the mindset of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Rural Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are being added not only to 50 Anganwadi centres in Bhageshwar district but also to Almora and Kausani.
Due to the hard work of the farmers, the income of this organization has not only increased to Rs. 10-15 lakhs per annum but it has also prevented the evacuation of people from the district from creating jobs for more than 900 families.
Everyone speaks about this, but don't we have the responsibility
Have we not seen that water conservation is the responsibility of the society
It must be the responsibility of every individual.
How can we save every drop of water in the rainy season
Our ancestors have done this for centuries.
They gave priority to the importance of every drop of water.
They have found new methods and learned how to save every drop of water.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Tamil Nadu, you might have noticed that in some temples there are large inscriptions related to water conservation and dry time arrangements.
In Mannar temple, Cheranmadevi, Mandir Pitta and Madurai, large inscriptions are found.
We should not forget that even today, various stairs are known as well as tourist destinations, which are the living examples of our ancestors of water conservation mission.
Atalj in Gujarat and Rani Ki Vav in Patan have been declared as the world heritage of UN education, science and cultural organisation.
In the months of April, May, June and July, they get the best opportunity to harvest rain water, the more we are prepared before, the more we get the benefits.
The budgetary scheme of Mahatma Gandhi Grameen Employment is being spent only for water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, all of them have been making their own efforts towards water conservation and water management.
On an average, an average of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water conservation and water management across the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme every year.
64,000 crore in 2017-18, about 55, i.e., about Rs. 35,000 crore has been spent in measures such as water conservation and water management.
In the last three years, more than 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted through these water storage and water management works.
Seventy thousand people working under the scheme have worked hard in seventy days and have revived the river Kuttumberur in Kerala.
Rivers of Ganga and Yamunu, but in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, for example, two rivers Sasur and Katheri in Fatehpur district dried up.
The district administration faced a huge challenge on land and water conservation activities under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
With the help of the people of about 40-45 villages, this dry sasur was revived to the rivers of Kaderi.
Whether it is cultivation, birds, farmers, agriculture or villages, have you seen how big a blessed victory
May, June and July are going to come, we also have some responsibilities for water conservation and water management, and we will also dispose of some schemes and we will achieve something.
My fascinating countrymen, before the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there are reports from all around me, letters are concentrated and phone calls are going to come.
Ayon Kumar Bener ji of Devidola village of North 24 Burganas district in West Bengal has registered his views in MyGov: We celebrate Ravindra Jayanti every year, but many have not been aware of Rabindranath Tagore's 'Peaceful, Beautiful, Beautiful and Beautiful Philosophy'.
Please talk about this thing in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that people will have an opportunity to know about it.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore was a complete form of wisdom and wisdom and his writings have made an incomparable mark in the minds of all the readers.
Rabindranath is intelligent and diverse but we can experience that every moment a teacher was alive.
He wrote in Kithanjali that he, who was the Knowledge Has the Responsibility to Impart it to the Students, that is, he has the responsibility to teach students who have knowledge.
I am not familiar with the Bengali language, but I was a habit of awakening early in my childhood, radio broadcasting in Eastern India will start fast and it will start late in western India.
Anantloke, Akuner and Borshmoni will get an opportunity to listen to these poems and there will be great inspiration in the mind.
Rabindra Sangeet and his poems must have lived.
My dear countrymen, in a few days Ramlan is going to start the holy month.
The month of Ramalan is celebrated all over the world with compassion and respect.
On the side of Nonbin's social side, it is only when a human being gets dry, he feels hungry of others, he feels thirsty only when he is thirsty.
This is an opportunity to remember the message and teachings given by the sovereign Mohammad Nabis.
The journey of equality and brotherhood is the lesson we learn from his life.
Once a man asked the sovereign, what is important to do in Israel.
The sovereign angel said, 'It is to be harmonious in all, even if we do not know, if we do not know the poor and the needy.'
Sovereign Mohammed Nabis believed in wisdom and compassion.
The sovereign Mohammad Nabi has said that if something is more than your requirement, then give it to the needy person, so that there is greater significance in the month of Ramlan.
People donate to the poor in this holy month.
The sovereign Mohammad Nabis claim that no man is a wealthy person because of his clean soul, not because of his wealth.
Lord Buddha inspires equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Baba Saheb provided power to millions of people who are undermined by the Constitution, to the victims, to the deprived, to the oppressed and to the oppressed.
There is no better example of compassion.
The compassion was one of the greatest virtues of Buddha in the piercing of the people.
In many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia and Myanmar, Buddhist traditions are mixed with the roots of Buddha.
This is the reason why we are enriching infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which connects the important places of Southeast Asia with India's special Buddhist places.
Today, there are conflicts and sorrows in all the places of the world and the teachings of Buddha Brahmin dissolve the path of eradicating hatred.
I convey my best wishes to the Buddhists and those who believe in the compassionate principles and to all others on the occasion of Buddha Purnima.
I offer blessings to the entire world from Buddha, through which we can fulfill our responsibility to create a peaceful and compassionate world on the basis of his teachings.
You must have heard about the laughing Buddha statues, while talking about it, it is said that this laughing Buddha will have the luck, but only a few people know that Buddha is associated with an important event in the security history of India during the revival.
Well, you can imagine what is the relationship between the Buddha and the Indian soldiers.
The Indian diaspora spread all over the world has given a new confidence.
That day is a Buddha Purnami.
On May 11, 1998, India conducted nuclear tests in Bokran, Rajasthan on its west border.
India's testing was successful and in a way, it can be said that India has demonstrated its strength in the field of science and technology.
On that day, in the history of India, the power of our armies was scattered in golden scriptures.
Lord Buddha said that the power of Andrathma is essential for peace.
Similarly, if we are strong as a nation today then we can remain peaceful with all.
On that day we showed the world that India has the power to achieve new goals and summits every day under the strong leadership of the land of great scientists and great scientists.
We will be able to see the new joy and new joy that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, once again we can join Mann Ki Baat and we will talk about many more things.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
Today, on the auspicious occasion of Ram Nawami.
On this auspicious day, my best wishes to all the countrymen.
In every moment of his life, we were able to see how much the power of Ram was in the life of a commemorative son.
On January 26, all the leaders of ASEAN countries came here and brought together the Cultural Committee.
It is a matter of great pride that most of the countries have given Ramayana to all of us.
That is, Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN countries of this region of the world.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of them.
My dear countrymen, like this time, all your letters, e-mails, telephone information and ideas have been received in large numbers.
You have heard about the launch of Sanskrit lessons in Gomal Ducker ji's MyGov online style, which I read.
Besides being from the computer sector, it is a pleasure to see their attraction to culture.
I have asked the concerned sector to tell you about the efforts made in this regard.
I would like to appeal to all those who are involved in the work related to culture and listening to the voice of Mann Ki Baat that you should suggest how to implement Gomal ji's idea.
Kanshyam Kumar ji of Baragar village of Nalanda district of Bihar and I read the ideas written by him in the Narendra Modi App.
You have expressed concern over the fall in the level of ground water, it is of course a matter of great importance.
You have been urging animals and birds to keep water in the summer.
Shakal ji, I bring your feelings to all the lovers.
Do you know what Yogesh Bhadresha ji has said this time, he has requested the youth to ask for health.
He believes that our youth are physically weak compared to Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, this time I have thought of speaking in detail with everyone about the health of India. I talk about a healthy India.
Young people can join hands and implement a healthy India movement.
In the past, the President of France had visited Kashi during his visit to our country and all the scenes of the journey were heart-touching and an impact.
Now, I urge you to lecture them, redweet them and bring them to your friends.
Anaka, Jayesh and many more children from Chennai have sent me the ideas made in their minds on gratitude cards behind my book Exam Warrior.
I would like to tell Anaka, Jayesh and all the children that after seeing your letters, all the tiredness of that day disappeared like a snow that saw everyone.
If I can read so many letters, so many telephone calls, comments, so many things I can hear are in touch with my heart.
If you want to tell them only then I have to say for months.
This time most of the letters have been written by children and they have written about the examinations.
They share their holiday plans.
In the summer, animals and birds have expressed concern over the water.
There have been letters from the farmer brothers and sisters about the programmes related to agriculture across the country.
Some citizens have positive suggestions on water conservation.
Our festivals, our culture, our traditions, have been tolerated during the festivals.
That is, Mann Ki Baat changes to the climate and the truth is that the voice of Mann Ki Baat has changed the climate of life of many people.
Why don't you change
In these things of you, in your experiences, in your examples, such conception, so much energy, so much concentration and thirst to do something good for the nation.
These have the power to change the environment of the entire country.
When I got the opportunity to read your letters, I knew how Ahmad Ali, a rickshaw driver from Karimganj district of Assam, had set up 9 schools to study poor children with his deep desire.
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Calcutta's taxi driver Saidul Laskar died.
In his mind, he made a pledge to build a hospital himself so that no poor person should die because he couldn't get treatment.
Sayedul sold the dragons in his house and collected money.
Many travellers travelling in his taxi gave money in a lucky way.
An engineer's sister donated her first month's salary.
In this way, after 12 years of collection of money, the Bhagirata attempt made by Sayedul Laskar ended with benefits.
Today, due to his hard work, a 30-bed hospital is ready in the village of Punari near Kolkata.
There are many such conceptions introducing and marking to my country.
Today, when the name of India is highly honoured, the unparalleled acts of Mother India's wealth are buried.
Today, this belief is born in the minds of everybody in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class.
We can move forward and progress can be seen by our country.
There is a creative and self-confidence atmosphere full of aspirations.
This self-confidence is a positive feeling that will fulfil our dream of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the months to come will be very important for the farmer brothers and sisters.
This is the reason why a lot of letters have come to agriculture.
This time when I see a video of discussions with the farmers in the Kisan wave of Doordarshan farmers, I feel that every farmer should connect himself with the DD Kisan wave of Doordarshan, see it and implement the benefits shown there in his fields.
Be it Gandhiji or Lal Bahadur Shastri ji or Lohia ji or be it Chaudhary Saran Singh or be it Saudri Devi - everyone has considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy of the country and the lives of the people.
Likewise, Lal Bahadur Shastri ji also repeatedly spoke about the importance of trees, plants, vegetation and the importance of a better agricultural system.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia has said that a large number of people should create awareness about ensuring better income for our farmers, better irrigation facilities and enhancing the production of food and milk.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Saran Singh ji urged the farmers to use new technologies and create innovation.
In the past, I had visited the Agriculture Development Festival in Delhi.
During the interaction with the farmers brothers and scientists there, I had a pleasant experience of learning, understanding and learning about the innovations related to agriculture.
But the impact of me was Meghalaya and the hard work of the farmers around there.
This region with less land has done a great job.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have achieved in Mahsoor compared to the last five years in 2015-16.
If the goal is determined, if the mind is inspired, it can be achieved and achieved.
Today, technology is handling farmers' labour, which is causing substantial strength to farmers.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big resolution has been taken to provide affordable prices to the farmers.
Besides, the work on Agricultural Marketing Reforms in the country is being done in a big way to ensure that the farmers get the right price.
Efforts are being made to connect the regional markets in the village to the gross markets and the world market.
While the farmers will develop and develop the necessary infrastructure for 22,000 rural markets across the country, the APMC and the e-NAM platform will be integrated.
In a way, such a system is being developed from the crop to any market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the beginning of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Gandhiji is the beginning of the Mahotsav.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Clean India is our mindset. Besides, how can 125 crore Indians shoulder to shoulder and should be able to show our tributes to Gandhiji in a very special way
Can we organize new programmes
Can we create new ways
I urge all of you to share your views on this through MyGov.
What could be the symbol of 'Gandhi 150'
What the hell can be
Please write to me your comments about these.
Today, the entire country has crossed a common approach in the health sector.
All the health related works in the country had already been the responsibility of the Health Ministry but now all the departments and Ministries, whether it is the Ministry of Cleanliness, the Ministry of AYUSH, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs or the Ministry of Women and Child Development or the State Governments, all are working together for a healthy India, there is no greater pressure on health and affordable health.
Disease prevention is a very low cost of health and is also very easy.
As much as we are aware about the prevention of diseases, it will benefit the individuals, the family and the society.
Cleanliness is the first need to be healthy.
We are all committed to a nation, as a result of which health security has doubled to about 80 in the last four years.
Besides, extensive work is being done in the direction of setting up of healthcare centres across the country.
In the form of preventive healthcare, Yoga has created a mark throughout the world with a new energy.
Yoga guarantees both physical and health.
This is the beneficial benefit of ourselves, so today Yoga has become a peoples movement and every household has got its place.
There are more than 100 days left for the upcoming International Day of Yoga on 21st June.
In the last three International Yoga Days, people have participated in the country and everywhere in the world with great enthusiasm.
We will also ensure that Yoga is an inspiration for all of us, our family and friends.
It should be further popularized by the new favourable methods, including children, youth and senior citizens.
Moreover, televisions and electronics from all over the country have been providing various programmes related to Yoga throughout the year
But can we create awareness about Yoga as a movement from now on Yoga Day
My sweet countrymen, I am not a Yogamaker.
But some people have converted me into a Yoga faculty through their creation, and I have produced three minute video like Yoga.
A widespread effort is being made to ensure that healthcare is accessible to all, to be affordable and accessible to the common man.
Today more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
Moreover, new centres are being opened.
I urge Mann Ki Baat lovers to bring the information about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras to the needy.
This will be the biggest service you have done to them.
Heart stent prices for heart patients have been reduced by 85 percent.
The cost of joint alternate surgery has also been fixed and reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Suraksha Yojana, about 10 crore families, that is, about 50 crore citizens will be treated and Rs. 5 lakhs will be spent in one year.
The number of medical seats in 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
New AIIMS (AIIMS) hospitals are being opened in many states to provide special treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be opened between every three districts.
By 2025, the target of getting rid of TB has been set.
Today, the mission of Make in India-Make in India is working successfully
Dr. Ambedkar ji had dreamt of being an industrialist and his vision is inspiring us today.
Today, India is emerging as a shining centre in the global economy and the highest FDI in the world is coming to India.
The world is looking at India as a centre for investment, innovation and development.
Baba Saheb had a firm faith in self-sufficiency.
He does not want any person to spend his time in poverty.
Moreover, he did not think their poverty would go away if they share something to the poor.
Today, Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India entrepreneurs, innovators and entrepreneurs from our youth have been created.
Today, historical efforts are being made to connect the waterways and ports of the country.
New ports are being built at various beaches of India and infrastructure is being strengthened in the old ports.
Most of the 40 debates were surrounding the 2nd World War, the emerging ice war and the country's division.
At that time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of Team India on one hand.
He spoke of the importance of federalism and strengthened the central and state governments to work together for the progress of the nation.
Today, we have accepted the mantra of cooperative federalism - cooperative federalism in all aspects of the administration and competitive federalism - competitive sir federalism
It is a matter of great significance that Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a concept of millions of people like me from the backward classes.
He showed us all that there is no need to be born in a big family or a seaman family and the poorest of the poor families in India can dream and all efforts can be made to fulfil those dreams and succeed in them.
But the painting of New India is completely different.
I would like to appeal to you that you should enthusiastically participate in this movement.
My dear countrymen, in the next few days there will be several festivals like Bhagwan Mahavir Jayanti, Anuman Jayanti, Easter and Baisakhi.
It is a day to remember the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir, his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir who has spoken of the message of non-violence will give us imagination.
My best wishes to the people of the country for Mahavir Jayanti.
As soon as the eastern talk comes, the inspirational instructions of Jesus Christ will always be reminded of his messages of humanity peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion.
Paisakhi Festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April
In the same days, Judg Sheethal and Sathuvain are celebrated with joy and joy in Assam, Bihu and Boila Paisa in West Bengal.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you for the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat Feb 2018
Today, I start Mann Ki Baat with a telephone call.
My young friends have asked me a lot of questions about science and some have written letters.
We all know that the colour of the sea is blue, but due to our daily experience, there is no color for water.
Why do we ever think that the river, or the sea, and why do you see
The same question was a young man in the 1920s.
This question has created a great scientist of modern India.
When we talk about modern science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
The name of Satyendranath Bose was given to the well-known fame, which is called Boson.
A few days ago, the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence - Wadhwani had participated in the inauguration ceremony of Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
This artificial intelligence is facilitating creation of robots, B (B) and specific machines.
Today, the machines are making their intelligence even more intense through machines.
This technology can be used to make the lives of the poor and the poor better.
During this programme related to Artificial Intelligence, I asked the scientists to think about how this artificial intelligence can be helpful to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can we know more about the occurrence of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can we help farmers in the field of crops
Can this artificial intelligence help in ease of accessing healthcare and diagnosing diseases through modern methods
A few days ago, I went with the Prime Minister of Israel to inaugurate the I Create Programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There was a young man and a digital device.
The young man said that if those who cannot speak through this instrument write what they want to speak, the instrument transforms it into a voice, it does so as to interact with each other.
I believe that in such a way we can use artificial intelligence.
Scientific and technology is a medium value.
There is no self-esteem for these.
Any machine works as we want.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered Light Bulbic, was defeating many of his tests.
Once asked about this, he said, "I have found ten thousand methods of how I cannot produce the light bulb."
That is, Edison has turned his defeats into a power.
Today, I am in Aroville, the Karmabhumi of Maharishi Aravind, not only accident but also a great deal to me.
As a revolutionary, he became a challenge to British imperialism, fought against them, raised many questions against their regime.
As a great sage, he questioned every corner of life.
He also discovered the answers and pushed the path to humanity.
It is important to know the truth and raise questions again.
This is also the genuine concept of scientists following the search.
Why, why don't you have to live until the answer to such questions is known.
My best wishes to our scientists and all those associated with science on National Science Day.
Rabindra Singh of Pune wrote on the Occupational Safety at the Narendra Modi App.
In our country, security standards are not as good as in factories and construction workplaces.
In his Mann Ki Baat on Safety, the Prime Minister has asked the people to be aware of security, as the National Security Day is on 4th March.
While we talk about public security, two things are very important - one being cautious and the other being prepared.
Security is two-way, one is important in disasters, the other is essential in daily life.
If we are not aware of security in our daily life, it is a difficult thing to achieve this situation in the times of disasters.
Beyond this, these words do not usually have any benefit in our life.
In view of natural calamities, most of the places are the result of some of our mistakes.
If we wake up, if we follow the necessary rules then we can save our lives and protect our society from large places.
Sometimes we might have seen many words about security in our workplaces, but we have seen that they are not followed properly.
I urge the municipalities and municipalities to conduct a model of training once a week in schools or once a month.
There are many natural calamities in this country, and disasters created by human beings related to chemicals and industries that we have experienced.
Today, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is heading the countrys disaster management issue.
Volunteers have been trained in the districts of floods and cyclone accidents and have been named as Dangers.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people were dying due to the wave of heat.
Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) organised a campaign to create awareness among the people by organising training camps for safeguarding the heat wave.
The contribution of everyone has had a good impact.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to the Heat wave attacks decreased to about 220 than expected.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can be safe.
We must turn into a society that is cautious against danger.
We have been traveling several times, and introducing defence mentions at the very beginning of the airplane journey inside the plane.
Well, was there a way to provide information
This is how we have experience in every field of life.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, emphasis has been laid on the use of natural gas in the villages from waste to wealth and from waste to energy.
The initiative taken for this has been named as GOBAR-Dhan-Galvanising Organic Bio-Agricultural Resources, i. e.
The objective of the Gobar-Dhan Action Plan is to make villages clean, livestock food, crop wastes of the fields, fertilizers and natural gas, through which wealth and energy are created.
Some European countries and China use animal food and bio waste to produce energy
But India has not been fully involved in this field.
Now we are progressing in this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen.
It has been decided to improve natural energy production through livestock waste, agricultural waste and kitchen waste.
Under the Gobar-Dhan scheme, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India should be encouraged and they should see food and waste not only in the waste but in the form of a wealthy instrument.
There will be opportunities for new jobs in waste storage, transportation and natural gas sales.
A cyber-trading platform will be set up for effective implementation of the Gobar-dhan scheme, which will connect farmers with the buyers and provide the right price for farmers' crop waste.
My dear countrymen, till date we have heard some kind of festivals like musical festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But a unique effort was made in Chhattisgarh's Raipur - the first bag festival of the state was organised here.
Raipur's inspirational and other districts also organized a sewerage festival for their participation.
Everyone shared innovative ideas about cleanliness in their corner, was involved in discussions, organised for the seminars.
There was a climate like a festival that was the centre of cleanliness.
This is a wonderful thing, especially the schoolchildren participated in it with great enthusiasm.
I congratulate the Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh, the government and the government administrations of Chhattisgarh for hosting the platform in the most innovative ways of waste management and cleanliness.
Every year on 8th March, we are celebrating International Women's Day.
Several events are being organised in our country as well as in the whole world.
Nari Shakti Puraskar is being conferred on this day to women who have done models in various fields in the past.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led progress, beyond the status of women-development.
On this occasion, I am reminded of Swami Vivekananda's golden language.
Today, it is our duty to ensure that the contribution of women in every field of socio-economic condition is equal.
Today our women's power is showing spirituality and self-confidence in their activities.
Where women are powerful and partners in all the developments of the country, it is our dream of a New India.
In just 20 days, starting on 26th January this year, these women have constructed one lakh seventy thousand toilets and have set up a preference, including about one lakh women groups.
In the lives of the poor people, the women of Jharkhand have shown that the Swachh Bharat Mission and the Swachhta culture have the power to convert it into a very common man.
Brothers and sisters, I was aware of the fact that in the three villages of Elephanda Islands, I was watching the news about how much pleasure they were about the fact that we had got electricity after 70 years of independence.
I am surprising that despite being such a special tourist destination, it has not been able to access electricity from Mumbai for so many years since independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanda Island - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Senthbandar - had left darkness and light from the lives of those who were drowned in the dark.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
Tell me what is the time that the lives of the people of the country will be illuminated and the happiness of their lives will be more pleasant and pleasant.
Brothers and sisters, Just a few days ago, we celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
The month of March is green boiling fields, the beauty of the swimming crops and the beauty of the swimming crops - these are the characteristics of this month itself.
At the same time, this month's Holip Pandik is close to our hearts.
On March 2, Holi festival will be celebrated across the country with great enthusiasm.
The importance of colors in the festival of Holi is that of Holika, because on this day we smell all the evils in the fire.
This is a brilliant moment for forgetting all the differences, participating in each other's pleasure and forgiveing unity and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, I am extremely grateful and salute.
My dear countrymen, Prakash Tripathy ji has written a long letter in the Narendra Modi App and has asked me to talk about all the things in it.
Kalpana Chawla ji went to space on 1st February.
Though they are not with us today because of the danger of Colombia space, they have been inspiring the youth from all over the world.
In this way, I express my gratitude to Prakash ji for telling Kalpana Chawla ji about the last day and initiating his letter.
It is a matter of sadness for all of us that we have lost Kalpana Chawla in such a young age but they have left the message that there is no limit to women's power throughout the world, especially for thousands of women in India.
Today, it is a matter of great pleasure that women in India are moving forward at a rapid pace in every field and are making the country proud.
Since ancient times, respect for women in our country, their contribution to society has been surprising in the whole world.
This details the importance of women in our society.
So they have given the status of women power in our society
It shows that the scholarship of the Vedic period of Lopamudra, Karki and Maitrei, the wisdom of Aka Mahadevi, Meerabai, the governance of Ahilyabai Holkar, the valour of Rani Laxmibai, etc. have inspired us and the pride of the nation has been inspired.
Prakash Tribadi ji has given many more examples.
Our Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recognised that the aircraft Sukoi was flying into the sky on 30th and said that the Indian Navy-led Indian Navy women group had travelled around the world at the INSV TARINI cell.
Pawana Khand, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi are the three vulnerable women who are conducting the training of Sukoi 30.
You're absolutely right to say.
Today women are not only moving forward in all fields but are also leading.
Today, for the first time in many fields, women-power is understanding and setting up a milestone.
In the past, the Honble President had taken a new pioneer.
Our President met a group of extraordinary women who were the first achieved in their respective fields.
These women accomplishers of the country, the first female captain of the ships, the first female driver of the train, the first female firefighter, the first female bus driver of Antarctica, the first woman to reach Antarctica, the first woman to touch the Everest peak, have achieved extraordinary achievements in every field.
With the help of harsh hard work, motivation and mental power, they have proved that they can cross all the barriers and barriers and create a new path.
On this path, they are inspiring not only the people of their times but also the future generations.
They have filled a new spirit and a new inspiration.
This lady accomplishers have also written a book on the first women who have come to know about these women-powers across the country and inspire them through their life.
This book is available in the e-book form of Narendra Modi App today.
Today, the importance of women's energy is contributing to the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, while we are talking about women's empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
You can imagine what kind of connectivity can be between a railway station, women's empowerment.
All workers are women at Madunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
This time, after watching the Republic Festival Parade, many of the people on Twitter and other social websites have specific significance about the packing section of the Border Police Force.
They were understanding adventurous acts and wondered that the scene was also surprised by the guests who came from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance.
Today our women-power is leading.
Self-sufficient shape is taking place.
I remember the wonderful work done by our tribal women of Chhattisgarh and they have given a new example.
When talking about tribal women, there is a decisive scene in the minds of everyone, there are jungles, roads, where women are burdened on their heads.
But our tribal women, our women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new scene in front of the country.
The Dandewada area of Chhattisgarh is a part of the Maoist extremists.
Maoists, such as violence, oppression, bombs, guns and gardens, have created a terrible situation here.
Tribal women have become self-sufficient and sufficient in such a terrible environment.
Besides, environmental protection is also strengthened.
I congratulate the government administration here and have contributed greatly after the success of these women from financial assistance to training.
Abandonment of contemporary disappearance and adjustment of changes in all necessary.
For centuries, efforts have been made individually and socially in the country against social deterioration and destruction.
A few days ago, a tasty step was taken in Bihar.
A human chain program was organised to root social deteriorations in the state of Bihar over 13,000 kms.
Through this movement, awareness has been inspired against the evils of child marriage and evil.
All the people of the state resolved to fight against evil and child marriage.
Children, elders, enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters have come forward and joined themselves in this movement.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this human chain is long in collaboration with the border of the state without self-confidence.
If the people of all sections of the society get the benefits of accurate progress then our society should get rid of such evils.
Together, we will not let these destructions go away from the society
Let us build a New India, a powerful and powerful India.
Over the past few years, people have written to me about this matter and have been telling me.
I have also seen several video and social media related to beneficiaries through this scheme.
It gives me the feeling of Darshan ji and others to get it.
The following objective of the scheme is to boost healthcare and ease of living.
People's medicines are at a lower price of 50 to 90 compared to traded drugs.
It provides economically beneficial benefits to the elderly citizens, especially the medicines that can be used for the common man, which increases the savings.
Generic medicines purchased here, i.e., similar medicines are in line with the standards of the World Health Organisation.
This is why good quality medicines are available at affordable prices.
Today, the central government has established more than 3000 Jan Aushadhi medicines across the country.
Through this, medicines are available at affordable prices and entrepreneurs have created new opportunities for employment for individuals.
Affordable medicines, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi and Amruth shops of hospitals are available.
The only objective behind all these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Mangesh ji of Maharashtra is sharing a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
That photograph attracted me very much.
One of them, along with his grandfather, participated in the Morna River Cleanliness.
The citizens of Akola have done the work of cleaning the Mornah river in connection with this Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Though the Morna river has ever been a 12-month-long river, it has now become a climate.
Another sad thing here is that the river is filled with forests and waterfalls.
I was told that the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched on 20th January 2018 and till the Morna river is completely clean, this mission will continue on every Saturday morning.
It shows that if one has decided to try, he cannot achieve anything.
Through the Jan Abhiyan, big changes can also be made.
I express my gratitude to the people of Agola, its district and municipal administration and all the citizens who have participated in the mass movement for this endeavour and this effort will inspire other citizens of the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion on the Padma Awards being conferred on the President of India tomorrow.
Newspapers and televisions are attracted to this.
However, it is a matter of great pride to you when you look at it, and we have great pride in us and we have great pride in getting awards and recognitions without any recommendation to them.
It is no longer necessary to be awarded, a person should be popular, but his actions are recognized by him.
He has been manufacturing sports goods for 40 years, so that he is working towards scientific interest in children.
It has been his endeavour to see children doing scientific tests with useless things.
For this, he is going to 3000 schools across the country and showcasing video films made in 18 languages.
See what a wonderful life, a great dedication
The lives of Sitavava couple of Karnataka state are similar.
There is no point in calling him a goddess that empowers her.
He has played an important role in transforming the lives of countless women in the last 30 years.
From the age of seven, he dedicated himself as a goddess, and dedicated his whole life for the benefit of the goddesses.
Not only this, no one has worked unmistakably for the welfare of the underprivileged women.
You might have heard about Bajju Shyam from Madhya Pradesh and Bajju Shyam ji was born in a very poor tribal family.
Even though he had done simple work for his life, he had an unprecedented country on traditional tribal paintings.
Because of this glory, today he has a value not only in India but also in the whole world.
His pictures have been displayed in many countries like Netherlands, Germany, UK and Italy.
The talent of Bajju Shyam ji, who was renowned by India overseas, has been given the Padma Shri award and honored.
The life of Laxmikutti, a tribal woman from Kerala, can be a pleasant surprise for you.
Laxmikutti is a teacher in the Kalar region, even today he lives in a drained settlement in the dense jungles and tribal habitations.
He has been chosen to produce medicines to be used after snake bites.
Lakshmi ji is constantly serving the society through herbal knowledge.
He has been recognized and awarded the Padma Shri Award for his contribution to the society.
Today I would like to talk about another one and the 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal has been selected for the award.
Subhasini Mistry ji washed utensils in houses and sold vegetables.
Today, the hospital created by his hard work is providing free medical treatment to thousands of poor people.
Sometimes, in schools and colleges, such people should be called and shared their experiences.
Beyond all the awards, society should take some initiatives.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
On the same day, Annal Gandhijis returned to India from South Africa.
On this day, we are celebrating an unparalleled bond between India and Indians from all over the world.
This year we had organized an event for the overseas Indians, in which migrants from India and members and mayors from all over the world were called.
The event was attended by Indian diaspora in many countries like Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States.
Some of them have printed in various fields such as Internet Safety, Ayurveda, music, poems, research on climate change, Indian literature, etc.
Some people have built gurudwaras from truck drivers, some have built mosques, that is, wherever our people are, some of those countries have been reformed in some way.
I express my gratitude to the European Federation for the recognition of the excellent work of the overseas Indians and for the significant contribution of these information to the two warriors around the world.
Even in today's times, we see how true the teachings of the field are.
As soon as we can, if we decide to go by the bottom of the eye, what else can we pay to him more than that
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you for the year 2018 and get a reply from you.
We have shared many things throughout the year.
Your exchange of letters, ideas and ideas for Mann Ki Baat has always been giving me a new energy.
After a few more hours, the year will change, but our shares will continue to continue.
In the coming year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for the year 2018.
A few days ago, on December 25, people from all over the world celebrated the Christmas festival.
We can also see the essence of service mindset.
It shows us the importance of service mindset.
In our country, we talk about "indecent action", that is, there will be no expectation of reflection in such a process.
'Seva Paramo Dharma', that is, service is the best.
My dear countrymen, this year Guru Gobind Singh is the 350th year of his birth.
The extraordinary life of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the great values of life and life on the basis of these values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, worked to inspire the people through all these contributions.
He fought against repression and injustice.
In this struggle, he had to lose many things in personal life.
But he has never placed mentality in his mind.
Every moment of his life has given the message of love, sacrifice and peace
Have you seen the uniqueness of such great features
I got the opportunity to participate in the 350th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh Ji in Patna Saheb in the beginning of this campaign.
Let us all learn from the great teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his conceptual life and try to improve our lives.
Those who were born in 2000 or after that, i.e. in the 21st century, will start becoming the eligible voters in 2018.
In the democracy of India, I welcome the voters of the 21st century and the voters of New India.
I convey my best wishes to these youngsters and I appeal to all of you to go and register yourself as voters.
Throughout India, as voters of the 21st century, there is a lot for you.
Voting is an instrument of a big impact to transform millions of lives.
You will not be empowered only to vote.
Today, in my voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about our commendable younger community, which is full of 18-25 years of age.
I consider them as the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth of New India, the youth, the enthusiasm, the energy of New India.
I am confident that the dream of a New India will be fulfilled by the talent and talent of our powerful youth.
When we talk about the New India, the New India should be freed from casteism, religion, terrorism and corruption.
It should be free from dirt and poverty.
Everyone should get equal opportunities in New India and fulfill the aspirations and aspirations of all.
Peace, unity and harmony in New India should be our guiding forces.
My youngsters, let's go ahead and see how to build a New India.
Young people from 18 to 25 years of age can sit together and participate in the exchange of ideas on New India, find ways and plans
How can we think of fulfilling our resolutions before 2022
Can we imagine the dreams of our freedom fighters to build India
Gandhijis transformed the freedom struggle into a massive mass movement.
My young friends, it is a time for us to create a peoples miracle to create a great India of the 21st century and this is a peoples miracle for progress.
How to achieve success through mindset
Today, a lot of new opportunities have been created before the youth.
Our youth are moving forward from skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken about the importance of positivity and positive thinking in the last Mann Ki Baat.
There is also a case in English - Pessimism Leaders to Weekness, optimism to Power.
I was asking the last Mann Ki Baat to share positive accounts of 2017 and welcome the year 2018 in a positive environment.
I am glad that a large number of people have given positive answers to the social workplaces, the MyGov website and the Narendra Modi App.
Positive India Hashtag has also made millions of tweets, which has gone up to more than 150 crore people.
In a way, this extension of honesty has spread all over the world starting in India.
The incoming tweets and answers are really conceptual.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
Some of the countrymen have mentioned some of the events that have had a positive impact on their minds this year.
Some have shared their personal achievements.
My name is Minu Batia.
I live in Phase-On, Phase-On, a packet of Mayur Vihar in Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
She wanted to study.
For this, I needed loans and I got it very easily and my daughter was able to continue to study.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm living in the boss.
My husband had done an accident to pay one rupee a month.
Unfortunately, he lost his life in the accident.
We know about the worst situation that we have done then.
We got a lot of benefits due to the help of the government and we were able to get it a little bit.
My name is Santosh Jadav.
Our BHINNAR was started in 2017 via Bahar village.
Because of this, our roads have become excellent and our business has started increasing.
My name is Dipansu Ahuja and I reside in Saddganj district of Shaharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Sadish.
We have been dependent on the military's pipeline for the last 40 years because of the water constraints in our region.
Now a pipeline has been built for us alone...
This is our biggest achievement in 2017.
There is a positive change in the lives of a large number of people because of many of the work done by their own positions.
In fact, this is the New India, we are building it together.
Come, let us go to New Year with these little joys, start a New Year, move from Positive India to Progressive India - from a positive India to a constructive India.
While we all talk about positive ideas, I feel like sharing a thing.
I was asked about the stories inspired by Anjum Bashir Khan Kathak, who was the most excellently elected in the State Governance Examinations.
He has emerged from the bailout of extremism and disintegration and has been the best in the state's regime election.
In 1990, you will be desperate to know that the militants had burnt his predecessor's house.
While extremism and violence were punished, his family was forced to break the soil of their ancestors.
He never left faith.
He had set a path for himself - the path of service to the people.
He came out of the opposite environment, he made his success story.
Today, he is an inspiration to not only Jammu and Kashmir but also to all India.
Whether the environment is bad, it has proved that through positive activities, it can dissolve clouds and dissolve them.
Last week, there was a chance to meet some women from Jammu and Kashmir.
The moments I spent with those women have inspired me, this is the strength of the country, these are my young wealth, these are the future of my country.
Millions of devotees come every year to this world famous temple to receive the gift of Sayaban.
But the Sabarimala temple is an example of how to convert cleanliness into a culture and how to find a way to solve the problem and how to transform peoples contribution into a power.
B.
Vijayan, a police officer, launched an Action Plan called Punyama Parkvan, in which he launched Swachhta Mission to create awareness about Swachhta.
This pilgrimage garden movement has become a part of the journey of every traveller.
There is also a strong resolution on cleanliness with difficult problems.
My dear countrymen, on October 2, 2014, we all made a resolution on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji, that is, the unfinished work of food, that is, Swachh Bharat, the free India of pollution.
He worked for this work throughout his life. He made efforts.
On the 150th Birth Anniversary, we had decided to dedicate to him the Swachh Bharat that we dreamt of, and contribute in that direction.
In the direction of cleanliness, efforts are being made throughout the country.
The transformation of rural and urban areas has been seen in a widespread manner with the help of public welfare.
The world's largest survey called Swachhta Survey 2018 is being conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to measure the quality of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will include about 40 crore people in more than 4000 cities.
The Survey will encompass the measurements of the Survey include elimination of open defecation in the cities, waste collection, transportation of garbage, scientific processing, transformation of conduct, capacity building, innovative initiatives for cleaning and peoples participation in this work.
As per the Survey, various groups will go to cities and conduct research.
They will talk to the citizens and get answers from them.
He will review the use of Swachhta App and development of various service centres.
It will also be observed that the cleanliness of the city has been created by the cities in order to make the citizens the nature of the city.
Cleanliness is not the only government to implement.
Every citizen and citizen organisation has a huge contribution in this.
On the basis of this survey, if there is a population of more than one lakh in your city, if there is a national level and population of less than one lakh then it will be given partial standards.
Today, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one thing with you through this programme.
I was observed that if any Muslim woman wants to travel to Haj, she cannot go without Mahram or her male guardian.
When I was asked for the first time about this, how could this be
Why did this distinction emerge
For many years, there has been injustice against Islamic women, but there is no discussion about this.
Such regulations are not even in many Islamic countries.
But this right has been denied to Islamic women in India.
I am happy that our government has focused on this thing.
The Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken necessary steps and finished the tradition of 70 years.
Today, I am happy that the Muslim women can visit Haj without a male guardian, and this time 1300 Islamic women have applied for Haj without male guardians. From Kerala to North India, women from different parts of the country have expressed their interest in traveling Haj.
Ministry of Minority Affairs has been advised to ensure that all women applying for a separate trip are allowed to visit Haj.
I am confident that the development journey of India is progressing and progressing only by the strength and knowledge of our women power.
Our sustainable efforts should be made to ensure that the powers and opportunities of women are equal to the men, and they will also see equal progress in the path of development.
My dear countrymen, on 26th January, all of us are historically important.
However, on 26th January, 2018, the next year will be remembered.
In the Republic Day celebrations this year, leaders of 10 ASEAN countries are coming to India as chief guests.
The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the gathering on the occasion.
This has not happened so far in the history of India.
In 2017, ASEAN has been an excellent one for India.
The ASEAN Organisation completed its 50 years and in 2017, India's joint 25 years with the ASEAN Organisation.
It is a matter of pride for all of us that on January 26, these great leaders from 10 countries of the world will be present here.
It is rare that there will be no festival on a day or the other.
Now all of us have celebrated Christmas festival and the next year is to be born.
May the coming New Year convey many pleasures, happiness and fulfilments to all.
We will all come forward with new temporary, new zeal, new inspiration and new determination and progress the country.
In January, the sacred period of Sun's Uttarayan will be celebrated in this month itself.
This is a time connected to nature.
If we say, every festival is connected to nature in some way or the other, but in our culture with diversity, this wonderful event of nature is a habit of celebrating in different ways.
If Lohri enjoys enjoyment in Punjab and Northern states then Kitchi and Til Sankranti are expected to come in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
Sankrand in Rajasthan, Mak-Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, all of them have a special significance and special significance for this.
All these festivals are celebrated between 13th and 17th January.
Even though it is different in the name, the philosophy of their foundation is the link between nature and agriculture.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on these festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to you all for the New Year 2018.
Thank you, my dear countrymen.
We will meet again in 2018.
Mann Ki Baat September 2019
There is no doubt that there will be any Indian citizen who does not pay respect to him.
He was the oldest of us at the age and was a witness in different stages of the country and at different times.
This is a great learning experience not only for our new generations but also for all of us, you have been the greatest concept of all of us, even after all these achievements in your life, you have always been primarily lauded for the development and work of your parents.
This feeling is very pleasant to me.
Nijama, I don't want to give you any trouble.
Why, I know how active you are, how much work you have, I do everything to see, I know.
Moti ji: Yeah.
Modi ji: Because of your love, we're very happy.
Modi ji: I am grateful to me for the gratitude that you have consistently shown on me.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on the birthday of my love.
Modi ji: When I came to Mumbai this time, I thought to talk to you.
We will celebrate several festivals like Navaratri Mahotsav, Karba, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Deepawali, Paiya Dhuj and Satpuja.
Several NGOs and start-ups of the youth are engaged in this work in many cities.
They integrate all the dresses, sweets and food items in the houses of the people and find the needy and bring them to them without any publicity.
This time, in this season of festivals, will we break the darkness in the light with complete awareness, mind and mind
The smoke of the faces of many poor families shall double your joy in the festive seasons, your face shall be even more bright, and your light shall be more bright, and your light shall be even more bright.
My dear brothers and sisters, on the day of Deepawali, ladies are welcomed at home to provide many daughters and full lives.
We welcome the monks traditionally.
Would we welcome the monks this time in a new way
In our culture, we salute women as monks because women are considered to be a compassionate compassionate.
Can we organise programmes to respect women in our society, in our villages, in cities this time
We can organise public programmes and accomplishments by their hard work and motivation, many accomplished women will be amongst us, in our families, in the society and in the country.
Can we organise programmes to give pride and value to these monks of India during this Diwali
The women who have done a lot of extraordinary work will be among us.
Some people might have tried to create awareness about cleanliness and health, some would have been engaged in some social service as doctors, engineers and teaching the poor children.
As a prosecutor, it may have been trying to fight for justice.
Our society should identify such women and be proud of them.
Just as we all jointly drive a cellphy with daughters across the world, we will end the movement of Bharat ki Laxmi.
The incentive for the people of India is to ensure a full life of the country and the people.
My dear countrymen, I had already spoken about the voice of Mann Ki Baat so that I get the opportunity to interact with many unknown people.
In the past, Alina Thayang, a student in far-flung Arunachal Pradesh, wrote to me an interesting letter.
I am from the Roying region of Arunachal Pradesh.
Some asked me if this time when my exam results came, if you were reading the book by the Exam Board.
I said I didn't read that book.
But after returning home, I bought this book and I read it twice or three times.
After that, the experience that I had experienced was very comfortable.
My brethren wealth is my first thanks for writing a letter.
I am very grateful to you for telling me the grievances thereof while studying.
I'll follow your order.
What is your experience in your daily life
Once again I express my gratitude to our young friend of Arunachal and student Alina Thayang.
My hearts and my countrymen, you will be aware of the untimely events of the Prime Minister of the country through TV, you will be discussing the unrest and unrest.
This time, Medveda's address to the second event in the final race was discussed as much as it was spoken about the victory in the US Open.
I also asked about the speech being spoken in the social networks and then I saw the lamp.
The simple and simplicity of Medveda in Dan, which was 23 years, was worthy of all.
If he was another, he would have been sorry and disappointed, but there was no argument in his face, but he made smoke in the smoke and smoke of everyone through his words.
All the audience from there welcomed his speech in a big way.
In the same lap, the motivation of the producer and the wonder of the winners was fascinating.
If you say you haven't heard Medveda's speech so far, especially the youth, please go and see, listen.
It has a lot of learning to all sections and to all the adults.
These moments are beyond the failure of victory, and there is no meaning for the failure of victory.
Life is a success and our pictures are very important to tell us this thing.
The idea of our ancestors is really surprising.
Mani Kanchana Samyog: Janayathi Loksya Losan joy: If a person has the ability and work together, he cannot win the heart of anyone
In fact, this young sportsperson has won all the hearts of the world.
My hearts and my countrymen, especially my young friends, I am going to say this thing for your direct benefit.
But in the beginning, if we wake up and prevent them, then it can be very safe.
I would like to keep this feeling in mind, especially to the younger community.
You all know that tobacco addiction is a very bad effect for health and it becomes very difficult to eradicate that habit.
Cancer, diabetes and blood pressure are more dangerous for tobacco users.
Due to this habit in adolescence it has a lot of impact on brain development.
But today, I have come to share a new thing with you.
You know, now there is a ban on e-cigarettes in India.
E cigarettes different from ordinary cigarettes are a kind of electronic device.
A kind of smoke is produced by humidation of nicotine liquid substances in E cigarettes, through which nicotine is inserted.
We are well aware of the dangers of ordinary cigarettes, but the misconception of E cigarettes has been spread.
That is, there is no danger of this E-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it should not have smell, so they mix a fragrant substance in it.
If a father constantly smokes at a house, we might have seen that others in that house would not smoke, and his children would not have a habit of smoking like him.
It is his endeavour that no one in the family should smoke.
Because he knows how bad the body will suffer from smoking and smoking.
Someone who smokes smokes knowingly, he is well aware of this.
But this is not the case of E cigarette.
People have no such awareness about EC cigarettes.
They are not fully aware of the danger of this, because of which sometimes e-cigarette enters the house quietly.
In fact, E cigarettes consist of many evil commodities, which will have bad effects on health.
Anyone in the occupation smoke will show us the smell thereof.
The dreams of every family should not be swimming in their feet.
Leave the habit of tobacco, do not take any wrong concept of E cigarettes in mind.
Come, let us together build a healthy India.
Yes, don't you remember Fit India
Fit India means that it is not enough to go to Jim at two o'clock in the morning.
It is necessary to get away from these things.
I hope you don't feel bitter to say that it will definitely be good for you.
All of them have not lived for themselves, but have dedicated themselves to others.
He is honoured by such a person in the Vedican city on October 13.
The works done for the benefit of humanity in the shortest life of the 50 years of Sister Variam Thrasia is an example for the entire world.
He had a great contribution in the field of social service and education.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but also for the entire world today that when we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, 130 crore people have been committed to liberate themselves from the vibrant neglect.
In the direction of environmental protection, India is leading the entire world in a way and today the vision of all countries is on India.
I am confident that all of you will be able to participate in the movement to get rid of the Negheti that will be used once on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this movement in different ways of their own.
But a young man of our country has taken up a very serious movement.
When I was looking at the milk of his work, I tried to call him and know about his new test.
When I heard this word of plogging for the first time, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word may be more useful in foreign countries.
Hello Riputman, salute me, I speak Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to you.
If 130 crore Indians have taken one step in this direction then India will move ahead with 130 crore feet towards the direction of getting rid of the neighbourhood used only once.
Ribudaman, once again, thank you for my great gratitude.
Moreover, I congratulate you and your team for such a new imagination.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, the world and the world are working on the preparations for the 2nd October, but we want to travel on the path of Gandhijis 150.
We want to move forward by transforming the interests of the country in our lives.
I would like to remind you of one thing earlier.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat I will speak in detail about it, why don't you even have an opportunity to make preparations for this
All of you will remember that on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
Thousands of children, elders, schools and colleges and thousands of villages of India should run for unity on that day.
My dear countrymen, all of you might remember that I had spoken from the Red Fort on August 15 and I had asked you to visit India by 2022.
At least 15 places, one or two or two or two places, should be set up to keep them there.
Once again I urge you to visit some 15 places in India because people are sure to visit the festival of Diwali.
Moreover, all these have been done only because of your cooperation, especially because we understand the importance of tourism.
My heartfelt countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you for various festivals in a diverse India.
A few days ago, there was an opportunity to have a far-reaching connection with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times team's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper published a journal about the children, in which they asked the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
They published some selected letters in the newspaper.
When I read those letters, they were good for me.
Kirti Hektay of North Karnataka appreciated the Digital India and Smart City programme and said that there is no country for children on classroom courses in today's times and they are keen to know about nature.
If we give information about nature to the children, then they will be an opportunity to be in the future for natural security.
Reeta Nadaf, a child from Lakshmeshwara, writes that she is the daughter of a soldier and it gives her pride.
If you are the daughters of the soldiers, there is no wonder that you are proud of yourself. If Irfana Begum writes from Kalburgi, then his school and his village will have 5 kilometres away.
My countrymen, I am glad that a newspaper has taken such a pilgrimage, these letters have come to me and I have got the opportunity to read them.
It was a pleasant experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today 2611.
Our Constitution Day is 26th November.
In 1949, on this day, the Constitution of India was accepted in the Constituent Assembly.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is the day when we remember the members of the Constitution.
They have been working hard for three years to resume the Constitution of India.
Those who read these debates are well aware of how their dedication to the nation was in those discussions.
Do you know how hard they have worked for building a Constitution for our country with diverse diversity
With understanding and vision, when the country is free from slaves, they did it.
It is the duty of all of us to build a New India with the illumination of this Constitution, with the illumination of the Constitution and with the clear thoughts of those who gave the Constitution.
Our Constitution is very vast.
There is no sign of life that it doesn't seem to be a matter of nature.
It is our duty to pursue not even one element of the Constitution.
Be it citizens or rulers, we should understand the feelings of the Constitution and move forward.
The objective of the Constitution is to ensure that no one has any share.
It is a natural thing to remember Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on the Constitution Day today.
Seventeen different groups were formed on the important issues of the Constitution.
The draft committee is one of the most important groups.
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the draft Committee of the Constitution.
He was playing an important role.
Today, we are enjoying the pride of giving the Constitution of India and the destruction of the efficient leadership of Babasaheb Ambedkar in building it.
He ensured that the benefits of all sections of the society are benefitted.
On the day of his disappearance on December 6, we will remember and pay homage to him as always.
It is remembered that Babasaheb's role in making the country self-reliant and powerful.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji was the immortal day.
Ayediya Sardar Patel had done an extraordinary work to work for the country as a farmer's son.
Sardar ji was also a member of the Constitution.
He was a member of the Consultative Committee of fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
Though 2611 is our Constitution Day, how can this country forget the 2611 which took place 9 years ago
The nation remembers and pays homage to the brave citizens, the police and the security forces.
This country will never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is one of the worldwide today, something or the other is happening everyday, it is happening in a terrible form.
We have been suffering from terrorism for the past 40 years.
Our innocent people have lost thousands of lives.
But a few years ago, while speaking about India's extremism at the global stage, many did not take it intensely in the world, but today, when terrorism defies their patriotism, the world governments see terrorism as the biggest challenge.
This is aimed at destruction of human powers.
Therefore, not only India, but all human powers of the world must unite and defeat terrorism.
The land of Lord Buddha, Bhagwan Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Gandhi ji gave this land to the world for non-violence and love.
Terrorism and terrorism are engaged in a terrible effort to weaken and minimize our social system.
Therefore, there is a need for time to be aware of human powers.
My dear countrymen, we are going to celebrate Naval Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our coasts.
I convey my best wishes to all those associated with the Navy.
You all know that our culture has emerged on the banks of the rivers.
Whether it is the Indus River, the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Saraswati, our rivers are important in both the ways of ocean, economy and war.
This is our entrance to the entire world.
Their navy played a major role in the expansion of the Empire of Empire and making it an economic prosperity.
Several examples of the naval invasions and experiments of the naval invasions of the Christians are still present in Sangam literature.
Most of the world's navy had long been allowing women in warships.
However, about 800-900 years ago, a large number of women have played an important role in the navy of the Christians.
Women were also involved in the war.
The ruler of Egypt had a comprehensive technologies related to shipbuilding.
When we talk about the navy, couldn't Satrapati Shivaji Maharaj talk about the opening of his navy
The sea-ridden Konkan shores were dominated by Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts related to the empire of Shivaji Maharaj, Sindhu Durga, Murud Janjeera, Swarna Durga etc. were located on the sea shores or surrounded by sea.
The responsibility of the security of these forts is the Maratian army.
Large ships and small ships were included in the Maratia Navy.
His navy was capable of attacking or defending any enemy.
After talking about the Maratian navy, can't you talk about Kanoji Angrey
He took the Maratian navy to a new peak and built Maratian navy bases in many places.
Sumitra was immediately involved in rescue work and handed over many fishermen to Bangladesh without being drowned.
During the flood in Sri Lanka in May this year, three ships of our ships reached there immediately and provided assistance to the government and the people of the country.
In June, when the Pappua New Guinea government sent an immediate assistance to us, our navy helped protect the fishermen in their fishing boats.
Our navy has always been proud to the nation to bring medical assistance to the country, to provide immediate relief to the country and to bring humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring countries.
The Indians on our security forces have always brought respect and pride, be it the ground, be it our navy or the air force, the courage, courage, courage, courage, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers are equal to the salute of every citizen.
The life of 125 crore Indians is because of the soldiers who sacrificed their youth for the country.
Every year on 7th December, we observe the Flag Day of the Armed Forces.
Flags will be laid on everyone for the whole week and the younger and the elder.
The mission to respect the soldiers in the country will be launched.
On this occasion, we can distribute flags of our military forces.
This fund is being spent through the welfare of the soldiers for the welfare and rehabilitation of the families of the martyrs of the war, for the welfare of the injured.
You will be able to know about various ways of economic participation.
Come, let us use this opportunity to work towards increasing the mindset of our soldiers.
We will also contribute to their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day on 5th December.
I want to tell some things to our farmer brothers and sisters.
All our food is related to this soil.
In a way, the entire food shop is connected to the soil.
Just imagine what is happening if this rich soil needs to be produced is not there in this world.
Trees don't plant trees, how can human life be possible
How can microbes be produced
The farmers of this country have been giving great importance to the two subjects of devotion to soil as well as scientific reverence.
While the farmers of our country are associated with tradition, the country is possessing modern sciences, they are trying and compassionate.
When I went to the Boranj area of Dohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh, I was asked about the farmers there.
Here farmers have been using chemical fertilizers in the past, which has affected the soil.
The revenues were decreasing and the production capacity of the soil was slowly decreasing.
In 2016-17, the crop crops increased by 3 to 4 times per acre and income increased from Rs. 4 to 6,000 per acre.
Moreover, the quality of the soil was also improved.
Due to lack of use of fertilizers, there was also economic savings.
It gives me great pleasure, my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions given to them in the Soil Card and their enthusiasm increases when they see the outcome.
The farmer brothers have begun to understand that if we should first take care of the land and if we take care of the land then this land will also take care of us.
Our farmers have more than 10 crore soil cards all over the country, so that they can know their land well, so that they can seed.
We bow down to the earth, but have we ever seen how much harm she suffers from putting urea on her
It has been proved in all kinds of scientific methods that there is a serious impact on urea in the soil.
When the farmer is the land of the earth, how can he bear the sickness of the earth
It is necessary to once again awaken this mother-son relationship.
Can our farmers, the sons of our soil, the landlords of our soil ensure that the urea used by them will be reduced to half in 2022 when it will be 75 years of independence
We all have begun to experience global warming and environmental change.
There was a time for the start of the cool breeze before Diwali.
But even in such a situation, some examples inspire the people who are awake all the time.
A 8-year-old Dushar, a person with disabilities in Madhya Pradesh, has tried to keep his villagers free from defecation in the open.
The eight-year-old boy couldn't speak, but he had a weapon to dissolve.
He woke up at 5 in the morning and went to the house of his village, and shook them, and made them awakened by signals that he should not waste water in the open.
Kumhari village was freed from the habit of defecating in the open because of this child who had given education of cleanliness everyday by visiting 30-40 houses.
This little girl has been working towards inspiring Tushar to take cleanliness forward.
It shows that there is no age for cleanliness and no limit.
Whether it is small or big, women or women, cleanliness is important for everyone, it is important for everyone to contribute to cleanliness.
You may be remembered that our talented sportspersons have won four medals in the Rio Olympics and have won the T-20 World Cricket Champions for the blind.
Various competitions are being held across the country.
In the last few days, 17th National Para Water Competition was organised in Udaipur.
Our young Divyang brothers and sisters from different parts of the country have participated in this and have shown their skills.
One of them is a 19-year-old gigger docker from Gujarat, even if there are 80 percent of his body's muscles, look at his courage, mind and hard work.
As a result of this talent, the Sports Commission of India will now be trained in the Centre of Excellence in Gandhinagar, Gujarat as one of the 32 Para Swimmers selected by 20-20 Paralympics.
I salute the young Jigar Ducker and convey my best wishes.
Today, special attention is being paid to access and opportunities for Divyangjans.
After a few days, Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi is going to be celebrated.
This day was born by the sovereign Hasrat Mohammad Saheb.
Welcome to the Prime Minister, I speak from Kanpur to Nirja Singh.
And I appeal to you that I will share with you ten best things out of which you have spoken in the voice of Mann Ki Baat this year.
And there shall be elders in our villages, and they shall never forget grief, nor forget joy.
We look at the past year-long calculations and analysis of the ideas and undertake the results of these, we are implementing plans for the next year.
We are trying to recall the interesting events of the past year in the media.
It contains a positive thing and a negative thing.
But in the year 2018, we cannot recall the good things that we have taken up in the year 2018 or cannot be remembered
I suggest to all of you that if you have heard, if you share 5-10 positive things that you have experienced, you will not have a good feeling.
Can you contribute to this
Can we share five positive experiences in our lives this time
We invite all of you to welcome the year 2018 in a happy environment, we welcome it with good memories.
We will remember the inspirations of others.
We will remember good things and create a good environment.
Good things provide the power to do good.
We will unite the strength and its impact of this collaborative energy.
In my next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely be involved in an effort to bring things that have come to the people of the country in this positive India.
My dear countrymen, next month, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will come to you again.
There will be an opportunity to exchange a lot of things.
Sath Puja is one of the festivals observed with various appointments and regulations that will be celebrated after six days of Diwali.
Traditional appointments are followed in every matter of what should be eaten and what should be eaten.
The significance of cleanliness in our lives is also relentless in this festival.
Before the Sat Pooja, the house is completely cleaned and everyone is involved in the cleanliness work of rivers, lakes, waterfalls, pilgrimage and pilgrimage.
The festival of Sun worship or Sat Pooja is a celebration of environmental protection, disease relief and regulation.
The feeling of the destruction of jewellery is in the background of this tradition that obtains prasad, and this evil culture can be a major obstacle in the path of progress.
It is natural that this great tradition of India is proud of all.
My dear countrymen, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is commendable and critical.
We can take the example of doors and handicrafts.
The joy and joy of the heart enhances whenever you hear that there is so much sale in a shop only.
On Diwali, about 680 percent of the Garhi Award sales has been registered.
Approximately 90 percent increase in gross sale of inmates and handicrafts is seen.
Today, it shows that the youth, the elderly, the women and all the elderly are wearing garments and handicrafts.
I can imagine how much benefit the families of the wealthy families, the poor and the families of the handloomers will be.
Rajan Bhat ji has written in the NarendramodiApple that you should share my Diwali experience among the security forces and tell you how they celebrate Diwali.
You all have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This time Deepawali has also brought a special experience for me.
Once again, we got the opportunity to celebrate Deepawali with our armed security forces at the border.
This time it was an unforgettable experience with the security forces in the Kurage area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all our security forces from all sides and from all sides for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our security forces are defending the country by facing all the difficult and difficult situations in the borders.
Whenever we have the opportunity, whenever we have the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our security forces and listen to their adventure.
Many of us do not know that our security forces are engaged in several important tasks to maintain peace not only in our borders but also throughout the world.
As a peacekeeper, they are proud of India all over the world.
For us, we are following the theory of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, one family throughout the world.
India has always been putting pressure on women equality, and I am happy to note that India has always been putting pressure on women equality.
Usually, it seems to be a small change in India, but it reflects a crucial thinking.
If we say that India's biggest contribution to various works in the field of Venus, then it will be the ICD.
India has always played a positive role in the UN peacekeeping activities.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served in about 50 operations in 71 peacekeeping operations across the world.
These activities have been carried out in all parts of the world including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Kango and South Sudan, India's military has provided treatment to more than 20,000 patients through medical services.
Most of them know that India is the first country to send the first woman police force through the United Nations Peacekeeping Movement in Liberia.
This activity of India is a concept of all the worlds.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police units.
It is a matter of pride for everyone that India's contribution is not only with peacekeeping activities, but it is also a matter of pride for everyone that India is engaged in training around 85 countries for peacekeeping.
Our peacekeepers from this land of Gandhiji and Gautamputra have brought the message of establishing peace and harmony all over the world.
Peacekeeping is not an easy activity.
Our security forces have to go to difficult places.
We have to live among different people.
Various situations and different cultures have to be understood.
We have to change ourselves in accordance with regional goals and environment.
When we look at him, the hearts of all the people of the country are proud and the only ICD award for the Paramveer Chakra award.
In 1989, he was appointed as Force Commander for action in Namibia, who dedicated his services in ensuring the freedom of Namibia.
As a messenger of peace, India has always given the message of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
Although he was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him 'Nivedita'.
It means that Nivedita is completely dedicated.
In the following period, he dedicated himself to his name.
Yesterday, the 150th birth anniversary of sister Nivedita.
He was very attracted by Swami Vivekananda, breaking his comfortable life and dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was heartedly affected by the injustices of the British regime.
The British have not only slapped our country, but they have been trying to keep us slave.
Reflecting our culture, the work of depression in our minds continues.
Sister Nivedita re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He was working to raise the awareness of the nation and unite the people.
He went to various countries of the world and shouted against the wrong campaigns of Sanatan religion and philosophy.
In the poetry, the renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramania Bharati innovation describes the equilibrium of the New Yuga Pander and their circumstance.
It is said that he got inspiration from his sister Nivedita.
Brother Nivedita has helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Phose.
He has collaborated with Bose for propagating and spreading his research through his articles and conferences.
It is one of the most beautiful features of India to fulfil one thing in spirituality and science.
Brother Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Bhosh are special examples of this.
In 1899, there was a serious Black Disease in Kolkata, in which thousands of people died.
Brother Nivedita did not think about her health and started the work of cleaning the canals and streets.
He might have lived well but he was involved in the service of the poor.
Inspired by this sacrifice, they started contributing to the service of the people.
He taught a lesson on the importance of cleanliness and service through his work.
Thank you for your phone call.
It is very surprising to hear that children are also suffering from diabetes.
In the ancient times, such diseases are called Rajroga, which means that such diseases can only come to the rich and well-being people.
Such diseases were rarely seen in the youth.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today, we know these diseases as a lifestyle disorder.
One of the main reasons for such diseases in young age is the decreasing physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in food habits.
It is also important to focus on society and family.
If you look at these things then you will feel that there is no need to do anything extraordinaryly.
We should be able to change our old habits and do small things properly and we should be able to do it naturally.
Children should be in the habit of playing in the open fields, and the family members should make efforts with awareness.
If possible, the elders of the family can join these children in sports.
Children can have a habit of climbing stairs instead of using a lift.
Everyone in the family after dinner can walk for a while with the children.
Yoga is particularly beneficial to create a healthy lifestyle among our young friends and to avoid lifestyle.
Before starting the school, you can see how much benefit you can do with yoga for 30 minutes
If I say that it is easy then it can be learned easily and if it is easy then it can be done anywhere.
There is no need for special equipment or fields for this.
Yoga is very beneficial in controlling diabetes and many researches have been carried out.
A study is being conducted at AIIMS (AIIMS), which is very incentive in keeping with the results that have been received so far.
We will not see Ayurveda and Yoga as mere treatments but make them part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, there have been many good news in the sports sector in the last few days.
Our soldiers have been able to win the Asia Cup after decades because of their best playing.
Earlier, India won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
Congratulations to the entire team and helpers on my side and on behalf of the people of the country.
After Hockey, India has suffered good losses in Betminton sports.
Betminton star Kidambi Srikanth has won the best in Denmark Open and has made India proud.
This is the third Super Series Premiere after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
I congratulate our young sportspersons and their achievements for making India proud.
Friends, This month the World Cup competition for FIFA below 17 years of age has started.
The teams from all over the world came to India and all showcased their talents in the footsteps of the field.
I had a chance to see a lamp.
The sportspersons and audience were enthusiastic to all.
The world is taking care of the great event of World Cup.
When we saw such a huge lamp, the strength of all the young men, the thirst to achieve it, the frustration grew up.
As the World Cup was successful, all teams showed their talents very well.
Even though India cannot win, the young sportspersons of India have won the hearts of all the people.
All the countries of the world, including India, had enjoyed this great festival, attracted and enjoyed the footsteps of the entire fashion.
The symptoms of the future of the footwear are very bright.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons and those who helped them and all the sports fans.
My dear countrymen, whenever I see the number of people writing about Swachh Bharat, I will have to dedicate every Mann Ki Baat to cleanliness.
Some are sending photographs on the efforts of small boys and some are sending information about the efforts of the youth.
At some places, some innovation related to cleanliness is being created or somebody gets news of the changes made by an officer's efforts.
In the past, a detailed statement was given to me about a revival story in the Chandrapur Fort of Maharashtra.
There was a non-governmental organisation called the Ecological Protection Organisation, which was working on the cleaning of Chandrapur fort through its entire team.
In this campaign that lasted for 200 days, they were engaged in the work of cleaning the fort without rest.
Continuously 200 days.
As soon as you see this, your disappointment will turn into confidence.
This Bhagirata effort for cleanliness, beauty, social activity and sustainable endeavour is a unique example.
The fort is a symbol of our tradition.
The responsibility of keeping historical traditions safe and clean is to all of us.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Ecological Protection Organisation and their entire team and the citizens of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on November 4, we will celebrate Guru Nanak ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Dev ji was not only the first Guru of the Sikhs but also the Guru of the world.
He thought of the interests of the entire humanity and sinned all the castes equally.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
He gave a message of sustaining equality in society, not only to stop his message with words but also to his action.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has given three messages to live a very beneficial life - to raise the name of God, to work and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave a sacred book Guru Grand to take his teachings.
On the coming year 2019, we will celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of our Guru Nanak Dev Ji.
Let us move forward on the path of his teachings and messages.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel will be celebrated on 31st October after two days.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only a manifestation of change but was capable of resolving the process, even if he had to implement it and explode as a very difficult problem.
He was an expert in implementing the idea.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took over the great responsibility of connecting India with the same fate.
Initially, he made sure that millions of citizens should be brought under the utensil of the One Nation, the One Constitution.
His ability to take a resolution gave him the power to cross all the barriers.
This word of Sardar ji is still reflected in the dream of a New India and is relevant to today.
That is why we follow his birthday as National Integration Day.
His contribution in providing an integrated form to the nation was unprecedented.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Ji, on 31st October, a programme for Unity Run is being organised across the country in which many people from all over the country will participate.
I urge you people to participate in this run for unity and join the celebration of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, after Diwali vacation, with a new determination, with a new determination, all of you have started joining your daily life again.
My best wishes to all of you for fulfilling your dreams.
It has been three years since you started talking to you through the voice of Mann Ki Baat in the sky.
Today is 36th.
In a way, there are allegations of India's creative power, feelings, hopes and expectations that are filled in all corners of the country, but I have given a wonderful opportunity to connect with the feelings of the people.
You might have noticed that I have never spoken this as the voice of my mind.
Whether it is email, telephone, mygov, Narendra Modi App, all of these are available to me.
Sometimes individual-related problems, sometimes social problems etc. are attracted.
Once a month, I take about half an hour of you, but people have been sending me information about Mann Ki Baat for 30 days a month.
I am grateful to the people of the country for getting the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common citizen of the country in such a short span of time.
In the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered the words of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
After that, I had received a lot of letters from everywhere in the country, many social organisations and many youngsters have been working in the work of dishonest food.
While watching, not only in India but also from all over the world, she has transformed into a big movement with her daughters.
This is not a problem of social media.
Every woman has become a new self-confidence and a new pride for the child.
Every mother seemed to have a mobile phone with her daughter.
There is a feeling that every woman has his own significance.
In the past, I had participated in a session of the tourism sector of the Government of India.
Whenever you visit, I asked the travellers to send me photographs of Incredible India.
Millions of films came from every corner of India and in a way it became a huge asset for the workers in the tourism sector.
Every moment the country is moving on the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something positive for the welfare of others, for the benefit of the society, for the progress of the nation.
In this three-year movement of Mann Ki Baat, I knew, understood and learned from the people of the country.
This is the biggest capital and great power for any country.
The sale of doors is increasing, which has led to increased employment in the houses of the poor.
From October 2, there is a substantial discount in the doorsteps.
I once again ask you that we will take forward the movement related to doorsteps and will further strengthen it.
When we buy doors, we have to bear the feeling of Diwali lights in the houses of the poor.
This work gives strength to the poor of our country and that is why we have to do it.
Increasing interest in doorsteps has resulted in innovation and motivation for the people working in the field of doorsteps and the people associated with doorsteps in the Government of India.
How to introduce new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to introduce solar tools is there.
They have started thinking about how to revive the tradition of the tradition that had been missing from the case for 20-30 years.
In Uttar Pradesh, the Sevapuri Kadi Ashram of Varanasi has been closed for 26 years, which has now started working with New Delhi.
That is, from 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on 2nd October, we had decided to participate in the Swachhta Celebrations across the country.
We will unite people through cleanliness.
Our Honble President inaugurated this work and the nation was united in it.
Today, the elderly and the children, the men and the city and the villages are connecting themselves as part of the Swachhta Mission.
We had promised that we will succeed and said that this Swachhta Mission is moving towards achieving success with the help of our commitment and it is spread in front of our eyes.
Everyone is making it suitable for them, helping them and contributing a golden role to achieve this.
All sports persons, theaters, academicians, schools, colleges, universities, farmers, workers, officers, police personnel and military personnel are connecting themselves with this movement.
One kind of pressure is felt to keep the people clean in public places and to keep them clean in public places and I feel that it is a good thing.
This time I had to pay attention to another thing - cleanliness is one thing, it is another thing that we should not be filthy from awakening.
At the same time, cleanliness is our natural nature and it is important to implement a thinking movement.
This time there were several competitions related to Swachhta Hi Seva.
More than 12 crore children participated in the essay competition.
Thousands of children imagined their imagination.
When we talk about cleanliness, I do not forget to thank the media persons.
They have taken this movement forward with a lot of cleanliness.
They have contributed immensely to the creative environment by connecting themselves with them in their respective languages.
We see how big the e-media and media of our country are doing for the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
A few days ago, a young man from Srinagar, who was 18 years old, told me about Bilal Dar.
Asia's largest lake is near Srinagar, in which he was removing plastic, polythene, utilized bottles and dustbins.
He also earned income from this.
Since his father was suffering from cancer and died, he added cleanliness to his life.
Bilal Dar is a young man in age and is an inspiring factor for all those who are interested in cleanliness.
In October this month, many of our dignitaries are reminded of.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri, the birth anniversary of 11 Jayaprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh in October, the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay.
This year is the centuries for Nanaji and Deen Dayal.
Nanaji Deshmukh ji broke the political life and joined himself with the Gramodai Movement and when he celebrates his centenary, it is important to pay respect to his work related to Gramodai.
When former President of India Abdul Kalam ji spoke to the youth, he will always present things about the rural progress of Nanaji Deshmukh ji.
He also went to the villages to see these works of Nanaji.
Like Gandhiji, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Ji will also speak in detail about the people in the market of the society.
Deen Dayal ji will remember how to transform the lives of the poor, the underprivileged, the underprivileged and the underprivileged in the society, education and employment.
Considering about all these dignitaries, it is not a thing that we do to them, but if we think of these great men, then the way we have to go ahead is broken and the way we have to go ahead.
In every city of the country, this movement of unity is very pleasant and the weather is also comfortable and it is necessary to get an opportunity to iron like Sardar Ji.
Sardar ji did not unite the country
We also have to participate in this drive for unity and take forward the mantra of unity.
We say that unity in diversity is the achievement of India.
While we are proud of the diversity, have you tried to experience this diversity
I would like to tell the people of the country, especially the younger generation again that we are alive.
Look at the diversity of our India, feel it and smell it.
You can see that this diversity of our country will be a school for the development of individuality within you.
There is a feeling of holidays, Diwali time and everywhere in our country.
The people of North India are unaware of what is in South India.
It is unaware of what is in the eastern India.
Do you know how many diversity is in our country
If you look at the speeches of Gandhiji, Lokmanya Tilkar, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalam, one thing will be realized that when they look around India, there was a new inspiration to see and understand India and to dedicate their lives.
All these dignitaries have seen India completely.
Before their action, they tried to know and understand India.
They tried to see India living in themselves.
Cannot our different states, different communities, groups, their habits, their traditions, their traditions, their customs, their food habits and their beliefs be learned as a student
It is the value of tourism for us to understand that we are a student, not just watching and standing.
I have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts in India.
The dream of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat is realized in this.
How many types of food habits
If you have every kind of food everyday in your entire life then there will be no chance of eating the same food again and there will be similar kinds.
This is the biggest strength of our tourism.
During these holidays, you should not leave the house but go out with the aim of changing things.
Your life will be completed by these experiences.
Your eyesight will be expanded.
Tell me, who can be greater than your experiences
If you go this time too, you would have taken this movement forward.
Wherever you go, share your experiences, share photographs.
Definitely send your photographs to Incredible India.
If you want to meet the people there, send their photographs.
There is a feeling in my mind that in order to encourage the tourism sector in India, what will be the seven most important tourist destinations of your state - every Indian should know about the seven places of your state, if possible, they should go to those seven places.
With the help of this, can you give any information about this
Can you express this on the Narendra ModiApp
Couldn't you know this in Incredible India
If a number of people from one state have said this, I will tell the government to release publication papers on the 7 locations that have been mentioned in every state.
In a way, how can the tourist destinations be taken forward with people's views
Likewise, you can imagine the places you have seen all over the country, which you have 7 most important places, and others have to visit and get information about these things, and you must send to MyGov and NarendraModiApp on your favorite 7 places.
Come on, join me.
During this period from October to March, you can become a source of encouragement to the tourism sector of the country.
I'm calling you.
Our dear countrymen, many things touch my heart as a human being.
I'm a man like you
The events that took place in the past may have come to your attention and the people of the country would have seen the magnificent example of women's power and patriotism.
The Indian Army has received two heroines - Lieutenant Freedom and Funds, which are extraordinary heroes.
If I say that they are extraordinary, they have lost their lives in the service of Mother India.
You can imagine how their mindset will be when the world falls down at this young age.
But the wife of Martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik, who faced such difficult situations, strengthened her mind and joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and joined the army and inspired himself to realize the dream of his husband.
Likewise, Nith Dubey's husband, Mahesh Dubey, who worked as a hero in the military, lost his life in Thailand's service, looted his wife, Financial, who joined the army.
There is no doubt that every citizen is respected by our mother-in-law and respect for these heroines.
My dear countrymen, between Navratri festival and Deepawali, the youth of our country have got a great opportunity.
FIFA: The World Cup for 17 years of age is going to be held here.
I am confident that the footsteps will be reflected all around.
Encouragement of footwear will increase every generation.
Everybody should participate in this game so much that there is no football in the field of any school and college in India.
Come, when all the world is playing in Indian soil, we will also make sports a part of our lives.
My countrymen, Navratri is going on.
This is the time to worship Mother Durga.
The environment is enriched by a pure pleasure.
There is a kind of spiritual atmosphere, festival and devotional atmosphere all around
On this auspicious occasion of Navratri, I extend my best wishes to the countrymen, I urge the country to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the common citizen of the country and take the country to new heights.
The country has the potential to face every challenge.
The nation should move forward at a rapid pace and when India was 75 years after independence in 2022, the efforts of the freedom fighters will be made to fulfill the dreams of 125 crore people, the mindset of 125 crore people, the untiring labour, the untiring energy and the mindset, let us move forward with the five-year plans for a New India, let the mother Para Shakti bless us.
My best wishes to all of you.
Please participate in celebrations, spread the puppet.
Our country is the birthplace of Buddha and Gandhi, the land of Sardar Patel, who was born for the unity of the nation.
For centuries, our ancestors have been honoured for the values of living and non-violence, and for our minds.
Ahimsa Paramodharma: - We have heard and said this word since our childhood.
This diversity is not seen only in food habits, habitations and dressing clothes.
This diversity is seen in every activity of life.
You must have seen that all our festivals have been set up in accordance with the list of nature.
All these are directly linked to nature.
Many of our festivals are related to the farmers and the fishermen.
Today, when I talk about festivals with you, I would like to say that Michami is a sad sorrow for all of you.
The Jains celebrated the Samvatsari festival yesterday.
The festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra.
Samvatsari is the last day of the festivals of Purushan.
This is a unique tradition in itself.
On the day of Chambatsari, it reflects for forgiveness, aspiration and friendship.
This festival is a symbol of time, unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the people of the country for the children of Chaturthi.
Now Onam festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
Kerala's Onam festival is one of the most important festivals in the colorful festivals of India.
Nowadays our festivals are the factors of attraction for tourism.
Be it Navratri festival in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal, I would like to tell the people of the country that it is a tourist attraction in a way.
Our other festivals have also provided an opportunity to attract the foreigners.
In this direction, we should think of what else we can do.
Idul Suha will be present in this festival for a few days.
At the same time, festivals should be the factor of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and cleanliness are connected to family life.
Preparation of the festival is to focus on cleanliness.
This is not a new thing for us, but it is important that it becomes a social nature.
They bloom colors, one blooms the vegetable, one puts a piece of paper in it.
Every family is doing various kinds of benefits.
In a way, the biggest training of environmental awareness has been seen for the first time in this Ganesh festival.
Three years ago we started the Swachhta Abhiyan and completed three years with 2nd October.
Its positive consequences are emerging.
Toilet areas have risen from 39 to about 67.
The people of Jamiat Ulema A Hind have demonstrated that it is not an inspiration for everyone to give a special example of unity to cleanliness.
If the efforts made with dedication and dedication to cleanliness have become a sustainable nature then no peak can be achieved by our country.
Whenever we get the opportunity, wherever we get the opportunity, we will seek opportunities.
But we all have to join it.
We believe that it is a kind of preparation before Diwali or the preparation before Navratri or the preparation for the forefront of Durka Pooja.
We will serve physically.
We will work together on holidays or Sundays.
We go to the nearby areas, we go to the nearby villages, but we can do it as a movement.
I appeal to all non-governmental organisations, schools, colleges, social-cultural-political leaders, government officials, district rulers and panchayat leaders - 15 days before the birth anniversary of Gandhiji on 2nd October, we will create an environment related to cleanliness.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
After setting up of toilets, you can register your name and the name of those whom you have helped to build a toilet.
My social workforce friends can drive some constructive movements and enable you to ensuring work on the platform.
The conceptual competitions will be organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, through the commitment to Swachhta, a competitive competitive competitive competitive competition, painting competition, etc.
In this, you can write in many languages, there is no age.
You can manufacture length and produce it in your mobile phones.
It should be a 2-3 minute short film and it should be an inspiration for cleanliness.
I invite all of you to join this campaign related to cleanliness.
After 15 days of Swachhta Hi Seva, when we celebrate the 2nd of October, see how clean the joy we have given to the honourable Gandhijis.
Millions of people write letters, reports, many are giving news through phones, this is a huge wealth chamber for me.
This is an opportunity to understand the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for the words that I give you more than what you wait for for the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I am thirsty because every thing of you gives me an opportunity to learn.
Yeah, I too have made such a mistake.
In some cases, we cannot even mention that if some things change naturally, we are doing wrong.
Prime Minister, I speak from Pune to Aparna.
I want to talk to you about my friend
She has always been trying to help everyone, but her action makes me desperate.
Once I went to the business complex to buy goods with her.
He spent Rs 2000 without any difficulty to buy a slaughter, then spent Rs 450 and bought a beatsa.
But the auto driver used to come to the campus was intensely involved in a deal of Rs 5.
When he bought the vegetables on the way back, he saved 4-5 rupees at the price of every vegetable.
I'm very painful.
We buy things in big places without any question, we fight our brothers and sisters who are working hard for retail money.
After listening to this phone call, I am sure that you might have been frustrated, why can you even be ashamed, and you might have made sure that I will not do this anymore.
Have you ever seen what will run in the minds of the poor
My dear young friends, the entire country is going to celebrate all the sports day on August 29.
This is the birthday of Major Thyanchand Ji, a hockey sportsperson and a magician of the Hockey world.
His contribution to Hockey is incomparable.
I recall this thing that the youth of our country should connect themselves with sports.
Sports must become a part of our life.
As we are the youngest country in the world, our youth should reflect in these sports fields.
Please tell me what else is that sports provide physical, aware mind and humanity development.
Sports is a medicinal medicine that connects the minds in a way.
I would like to say that the younger generation of our country should move forward in the sports world and that is also important in the world of sports fields and computer sports.
All the FIFA footsteps can play in the computer, but I can see the footsteps in the field.
You can play cricket in the calculation, but play in the field under the sky, its joy is different.
At one time when all the children went out at home, they asked when the mother would come back.
As soon as it has changed in today's times, children sit in one corner and start watching cartoons or drowning in mobile cameras.
Any children of the country, who have a talent in the field of sports, who have a talent in the field of sports, can welcome their details or video on this portal.
The portal is being launched by the Ministry of Sports to train selected and developing sportspersons tomorrow.
In India, from 6th to 28th October, the FIFA is organising the World Call Cup for 17 years of age.
24 teams from all over the world are going to play in India.
Let us welcome the young guests from many countries through the sports festivals, let us experience sports and create an environment in the country.
Talking about sports, I would like to share with you about the event that took place in the past weeks.
Six such women are working in the naval.
Their feelings and inspirations are inspiring to all of us.
These six women wealth are traveling in a small boat INS TARINI and are trying to cross the seas.
Navika Sagar Parikrama, the Navika Sagar Parikrama i. e.
They will return to India after several months around the world.
Sometimes they will spend about 40 days in water.
Sometimes it may have to be spent in water for about 30 days.
In the midst of the waves of the sea, our six women wealth travel with courage and this is the first time in the world.
I am also organising a separate way for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App and you are studying
You must read it because I am happy to share the experiences of this woman wealth with you in a kind of courageous story, self-experienced story.
My heartfelt congratulations to these women and many good wishes.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating Teachers Day on 5th September.
Former President of our country, Dr.
This is the birthday of Radhakrishnan ji.
Though he was the President, he had put himself in the forefront of his life.
He always wanted to live a young man.
He was dedicated to the educational field.
Though he was an advocate, a diplomat, the President of India, he was a living survivor in every moment.
I remember him.
When we celebrate Teachers Day this time, can we all take a pledge together
Due to his efforts, the events that have been successful in transforming the lives of every teacher will certainly be in the lives of every teacher.
If we try socially, we can transform the country, we can contribute to it.
Let's learn to see change, let's take this mantra forward, let's come.
Annaya Awasthi.
I live in Mumbai and work for the Indian Research Centre of Howard University.
As an analyst, I have a special interest in financial inclusion and social programmes related to it.
I would like to ask you the question that in 2014, you have started Jan Dhan Yojana and in the past three years, whether India is more secure, whether the energy has increased, whether this empowerment and facilities have reached all our women, farmers, workers, villages and slums.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been asked about financial inclusion, which is not only in India but also in the discussions of experts around the world.
On 28th August 2014, I had started this scheme with a dream in my heart.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be launched by 28th August tomorrow and will complete 3 years.
30 crore new families have been connected to it and bank accounts have been opened.
This is the highest number of countries in the world than the population of many countries.
Sometimes, if the money swallows in the hands, if it is in the bag, if it is in the house, then it will inspire to spend the harvest.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the money deposited in the banks is Rs. 65,000 crore.
In a way, this saving of the poor will be their strength in the future.
Those who have opened bank accounts through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will get insurance benefits.
Today, a new confidence has been created in the lives of the poor by paying a simple amount of Rs. One rupee and Rs.
In many families, if there is a problem for the poor because of this one rupee, if the family head dies, then the family gets Rs. 2 lakh.
Be it the underprivileged sections of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, be it the Scheduled Tribes, be it the Scheduled Tribes, the Academic Youth, be it the youngsters who stand in their own feet, such millions of youngsters have been provided without any bail from the banks under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
They are not only standing in their own feet but also in successful efforts to provide employment to two people.
Some people from the banking sector had come to meet me in the past and said that they had got a lot of inspirational things when they had done a study on the benefits of the common people due to Jan Dhan Yojana, insurance schemes, RuPay cards and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I will take all these things in your sight.
Even the media members are involved in events that can be fully utilized.
They can also interact with such people and create a new concept for the new generation.
My dear countrymen, once again my condolences to all of you.
English rendering of PMs address at Indian Radio today morning
The rainy season has become a time to attract the minds of the people.
Animals, birds, plants and nature bloom in the rainy season.
But sometimes, when this rain is very heavy, we know how much the water has the power to destroy.
Nature is the mother who gives us life, develops us all, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, landslides and their hot forms cause great destruction.
Changing climate and environmental change have a negative impact.
Over the past few days, natural calamities had to be faced due to heavy rains in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, Northeast, Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Bengal.
Comprehensive monitoring measures are being taken in flood affected areas.
State governments are also making immense efforts to help the people affected by floods.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and emotional citizens are also making their best efforts to help the people in this situation.
Crops, livestock wealth, infrastructure, roads, electricity and communication systems are all affected.
In order to meet the losses of our farmer brothers and their crops, we have initiated livelihood schemes for insurance companies, especially crop insurance companies, to meet the farmers' compensation demands immediately.
Moreover, the system of 1078, which is 24-hour aid to tackle the flood, is fully operational.
People are expressing their problems in this regard.
Before the start of the rainy season, the entire government machinery was prepared for training in most places.
The National Disaster Rescue Forces were crumbled.
In many places, efforts were made to provide them training on what should be done and what should not be done, deciding volunteers, creating a peoples organisation and acting in such circumstances.
Nowadays, the weather has already been imagined, technology has grown more, space science has played a big role in calculating it, which has led us to almost the right estimation.
Gradually, according to the climate calculation, we should change our nature to build our actions and to avoid the impact of disasters.
Whenever I am preparing for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I can see that the people of our country are engaged in the preparation of it.
This time there have been a lot of letters and telephone calls on GST
Even today, people have expressed their happiness and hopes about the GST.
Listen to this telephone call: "Congratulations, Prime Minister, I speak from Kurghavan, i.e. from Gurugram to Karg.
As a month has passed, are you expecting the results
I would like to know about this, thank you.
Goods and Services Tax has been implemented for nearly a month and its results have started to be known.
I see how this new structure has been affected in the transport and services sector.
Items are also accumulating at a fast pace.
Despite this facility, it has added strength, especially to the economic pace.
Due to the earlier separate tax regime, most of the resources and documents of the transport and services sector had to be maintained and new settlements had to be set up in every state.
This tax, which I say, is good and simple tax, has indeed created a very positive impact on our economy in a short span of time.
The speed at which there has been a improvement, the speed at which there has been a new change, the new records have been recorded, all these have created a new hope throughout the country.
In many of the world universities, this will be a model study.
Because with such a huge change, with the participation of millions of people, the successful implementation of this system in such a big country can be considered as a great success.
S.
All the states have a role and responsibility in implementing the GST.
All decisions and states have been taken together by the Union Government.
What was the price of a certain thing that was preceded by the App and how it was after the new notification, everything is available in your mobile phones.
This is a historic victory and historic achievement.
This is also a kind of social reform movement.
I salute millions of millions of people who have made such a great endeavour in a very natural way.
My dear countrymen, the month of Revolution in August.
Naturally, we have been asked about this thing before the childhood, the reason for the launch of the Cooperation Movement on 1st August, 1920.
Then on August 9, 1942, we know that the uit India Movement was launched and it was the August Revolution.
Later in 1947, the country was freed on August 15, 1947.
In a way, several events of August have been specially linked to the history of freedom.
This year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
But Dr. Harsh Vardhan presented the slogan that India should leave.
Some people knew that Yusuf Mehr Ali was.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, we should inspire us to build a glorious India, all the historic aspects of the country's people who have joined themselves in the freedom struggle, bonded themselves and bonded evils.
What else can be the greater concept of sacrifices, penance and dedication of our freedom fighters
The uit India Movement is the most important struggle of the India Freedom movement.
This struggle was the only one to get rid of the British regime and to the entire nation.
At that time, in every corner of Hindustan against the British rule, villages, towns, educated, uneducated, poor and rich, all joined shoulder to shoulder and participated in the uit India struggle against the British regime.
The anger of the people was at the peak.
Millions of people, who listened to Gandhiji's chariot, took the mantra of 'Cetumadi' in our hearts and in our hearts and took forward the struggle.
Millions of youngsters of the country have given their teachings and books in the freedom struggle.
The sangnatha of freedom was shouted and they went ahead.
Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan have played a leading role in this regard.
The Cooperation Movement of 1920 and the uit India Movement of 1942 showcases two different dimensions of Gandhiji.
The diverse dimension of cooperation was that in 1942, how much the freedom choice had increased, the mantra of 'Keta' or 'Cetu Madi' like Gandhiji had to be proposed.
The freedom struggle that started in 1857 has continued every moment till 1942 in some part of the country.
This long-standing period created freedom in the minds of the people.
Everyone was determined to do something.
Generations have changed, but there is no relaxation in mind.
The people used to come and join themselves, went and new people came and joined themselves, they tried everyday in the country to drive the British rule.
From 1857 to 1942, this struggle had created a new position, and 1942 brought this position to the top.
The congregation of uit India was sounded and within five years the British had to leave the country in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, freedom candidates had reached all the people.
This five years from 1942 to 1947, which was evident from the mindset of the people, was the reason for the freedom of the country.
This five years is his determined year.
Now I want to connect you with this account.
In 1947, we were free.
Today we are in 2017.
About 70 years have passed away.
The governments came.
Organisations have emerged, transformed, developed.
Everyone has made efforts in their own way to overcome the country from its problems.
Efforts were made to increase employment in the country, eradicate poverty and develop.
Efforts were made in their own ways.
The success was also achieved.
We have to celebrate the 15th day of August this year and the 75 years of our independence in 2022, we have achieved the success of this century.
Remembering the 9th August Revolution Day of August, everybody will take a pledge on 15th August, as a citizen, I will do this amount for the nation, I will do it as a family, I will do it as a society, I will do it as a city, I will do it as a government department and I will do it as a government.
Millions of people have to commit a casualties.
Efforts should be made to fulfil such challenges.
Just as the five years from 1942 to 1947 have been determined to ensure the independence of the country, we have to collaborate with this five years from 2017 to 2022 for achieving the future of India.
We are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the country's independence after five years.
Every citizen, every social organisation, local organisation, schools, colleges, different organisations, all of us will take a pledge to create a New India.
May this be a pledge to achieve our percentage in the next five years.
As a nation, which goal should we reach
What can be my contribution as a person
Use technology, bring forward video, posts, plastics, books and new ideas.
Let us transform this movement into a mass movement.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi App will compete for young social friends, uit India uit uit uit uestion.
This question competition is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and to know about the heroes of freedom struggle.
I am confident that you will spread this message well and spread it.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, I get the opportunity to interact with the nation from the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
I'm a tool.
I read them and I will try to show them how long I have on August 15.
Accusation was made before me that the speeches made by me on August 15 last three times were a bit long.
I am trying to regulate my rules and I do not know whether I can do it or not.
But I am keen to try this time to make my speech brief.
I can see if I don't have any success in this.
Friends, I want to talk to you about another thing.
The economy of India consists of a social economy.
We should never calculate it less.
Our festivals, our festivals are not just a joyous occasion.
Our festivals, celebrations and a movement for social revival.
In addition to this, every festival is directly linked to the economic life of the poor.
After a few days, Rakshabandhan, Krishna Jayanti, then Pillar Chaturthi, then Saud Chandra, then Anant Chaturdasi, Durga Puja, Deepawali will come together.
These link individuals and society.
The natural journey between these two continues.
Ah Sey is an opportunity to move from the point of view of me.
As an economic situation, many families have started making rocks as small slum entrepreneurs even months before Raksha Bandhan festival.
Different types of rocks are being created with cotton to silk rocks.
But now people have begun to love the rocks that are being produced at home.
This is directly linked to the poor artisans who produce small pool lights.
But when I talk about the festivals and the economic condition of the poor associated with them today, I would like to clarify the environment.
Sometimes I see the people of the country being more aware and positive than me.
In the last one month, aware citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
You have already asked me to talk about the environment-friendly child before the child Chaturthi, and then you have requested me to increase the desire for the child made on the soil and plan from now on.
I first express my gratitude to such aware citizens.
At the same time, it should be our commitment to create an ecosystem-friendly and soil-made surveillance surveillance.
This time I have already said this time
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the various festivals and celebrations that will come.
Our women and women have done a great job in the World Cup in the last few days.
This week there was an opportunity to meet all of them.
I was happy to interact with them, but I realized that they were pressing them that they could not win the World Cup.
This pressure on their faces was the ship of this crisis.
I gave a different assessment to those women on my side.
Look, today's time is the media world, expectations have grown, the extent that has been increased, the success has not been achieved, it turns into anger
If the sportspersons of India have failed, we have seen the anger of the country on those sportspersons in many sports games.
Besides, they praised and proud of the achievements made by these women.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially women, are engaged in many things in pride of the nation.
Once again, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the youth, especially to our women.
We all have to take the country to new heights and take it to new heights.
Come, let us travel together, let us travel by doing something.
Let us move and move forward in our hearts that the future of the country will certainly be better.
My best wishes.
The climate is changing.
After the rain, the cold wind has given a little breath from the summer heat in the past.
Whatever place is faced in life, however crisis, individual life, in public life, in the rainy season, in the mindset of all of us, we feel that there is a good change in the mindset.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, there is a word called juggernaut, which means that no one can stop it.
On seeing in Agaradhi, it was known that the word Jagarnaute has been made on the lines of Jagannath's chariotic journey.
When we see all these things, we can understand how the world is accepting this greatness in their own ways.
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath, I convey my best wishes to all the nations and bow down to the shrines of Lord Jagannath.
Come, let us all collectively get inspiration from these holy festivals and share the treasure of happiness and take the country forward on the path of development.
In this holy month of Ramlan, we have come to know that a concept of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
There about 3500 Muslim brothers and sisters live in this small village with their families, in a way there are brothers and sisters of a large number of Islamic families.
This month in Ramalan, the villagers decided to build toilets together.
So they have said that they should spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for the transformation of this sacred festival of Ramalan for social welfare.
We know that Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have been declared ODF States.
I express my gratitude to the administration, rulers and the people of these five states.
We are aware that if we have to do something good individual or social life then we should work hard for it.
If we think that our signature is bad, we should try to correct it for a long time.
That is why it will turn into a physical and mental habit.
Likewise, some other bad habits are natural.
We must attract everyone's attention.
We must recall the inspirational events.
I am happy that cleanliness has not remained at the level of the government today.
This has been transformed into a movement of people's society.
This happened in the Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What is its goal
Out of 71 Gram Panchayats, 10,000 households will be constructed in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the government have succeeded in constructing 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
In) comes through letters and through the sky.
Prakash Tribadi recalled the situation and said that on June 25, the history of democracy is one of the greatest.
The awareness of Prakash Tribal Ji on democracy is commendable and democracy is not just an organisation but it is a culture.
At the same time, we have to take forward the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it is a dark night, no one can easily forget it.
No Indian can leave it.
All the great leaders of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were imprisoned.
Today, the students of the media world, all those working in the democratic system, have been working in a continuous effort to create awareness to remind that bitter period.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji wrote a poem after an emergency was announced in the country, and in that poem he describes the atmosphere in the country during that period.
We have to make this tradition stronger.
My dear countrymen, today every Indian remembers the head and feels very proud.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world is Yogay.
Everyone from water to mountain was welcomed by sun rays and yoga in the morning.
Yoga has not been earlier but today Yoga has become a bridge to connect the world.
Almost all the countries of the world have converted this Yoga into an opportunity for them.
More than 4000 people in the Abudabi of the United Arab Emirates, at the height of 2400 metres from the sea level in Machu Pichu, the world heritage symbol of China and the world heritage of the greater country.
India-Afghan partnership in Herath, Afghanistan, has been engaged in Yoga at the Salma Dam and has created a new film for friendship.
Even in small places like Singapore, 70 programmes have been organized and they have taken this campaign for a week.
This time again Yoga has achieved the world.
In Ahmedabad of Gujarat, about 55 thousand people have achieved a new world achievement by combining Yoga.
I and Lucknow have got an opportunity in Yoga.
But for the first time in the rainy season, it was also a good opportunity for Yoga.
Our soldiers were also engaged in Yoga art even in Siyachen, the temperature of 20, 25, 40 degrees.
Our Army, Border Security Forces, Indian Tibetan Border Police Forces, Central Reserve Police Forces and Central Industrial Security Forces all performed their duties and performed Yoga training.
Since this is the third International Day of Yoga, I had requested the families of three generations to take the film of Yoga and share with me.
Some television channels also carried forward this thing.
A lot of people have sent photographs to me, some of which have been selected in the Narendra Modi App.
Honble Prime Minister, I am Dr.
Annil Sonara speaks.
I recall that you have recently spoken in Kerala that instead of giving brass at various places, we should give good books as a memorial.
We cannot do anything to implement this idea throughout the country.
I liked it very much.
I am reminded of a thing that has escaped from my memory again.
Because when I was in Gujarat, we should not give garlics anymore, we had created a way to give books or welcome a handkerchief.
And that too, we will give a handkerchief because it can encourage the doorsteps.
This was a habit when I was in Gujarat, but after coming from there, this habit has been abandoned.
But when I went to Kerala, I was once again aware of it.
But when we give books, in a way it becomes part of the house and becomes a member of the family.
We can also welcome the dresses and know how much it is helpful to the poor
The cost deficit is also utilised properly.
These things have historical importance.
When I went to the UK last year, the British ueen Elizabeth in London had invited me to the banquet.
He brightened a light in his eyes, and congratulated me when he was married, and said in a joyous voice that Gandhiji had presented this handkerchief.
For many years, but Elizabeth Rani preserved the handkerchief given by Gandhiji.
One of the greatest loves of Gandhiji has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
These habits don't change night with night, and this is why criticism is overwhelming.
At the same time, efforts should be made to participate in such conversations.
For this, whenever I go anywhere, I don't deny that if someone brings it, don't want it, I can't do it.
Criticism rises, we have to repeat, gradually change a change.
My dear countrymen, there are many functions as the Prime Minister of the country.
Despite being drowned in the pockets, I am making a habit, that is, I have been making an opportunity to connect with the ordinary people by reading something in my letters.
Various letters come and many people write letters to me.
I feel that it is necessary to share a letter I read a few days ago with you.
Therefore, under the Mudra scheme, I have started the work of getting money from the bank and buying some goods from the market.
In the meanwhile, I focused on the Government of India E-Marketplace and the Government of India E-Marketplace.
Whoever wants to give something to the government - if you want to sell anything like electric bulbs, utensils, towers, chairs, tables, they can register themselves on this platform.
He can keep in mind what kind of goods he has, what he can sell, and it is mandatory that the government departments should go to this platform and see who provides quality goods at affordable prices and buy goods.
In this way, all the departments of the government are monitoring who are registering in e-GEM.
Due to lack of intermediaries, goods are available at affordable prices.
This is the opportunity to encourage entrepreneurship.
It also has illumination, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
I want all those who want to sell their goods to the government, all of them should register themselves on this portal in large quantities.
My dear countrymen, while we are proud of Yoga, our achievements in space science are also inspiring.
While our footsteps are attached to the earth, it is the greatest specialty of India that we dream of touching the planet from far off places.
In the past, India has shown a great achievement in sports and science.
Today, India is not only on the earth but also on the planet.
Two days ago, Indian Space Research Institute (ISRO) has successfully launched 30 Nano satellites along with Cartosat-2 satellites.
In addition to India, there are about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
The Nano Satellite Mission of India will help in achieving information related to agriculture and natural fury.
Crossing 1000 days is an important milestone in our scientific journey.
Now we can see that our youngsters are progressing in the field of sports.
Apart from education, they understand their future in the field of sports.
Our sportspersons, their efforts and their achievements have made the country proud.
Recently, Kidambi Srikanth ji has won the Indonesia Open and has made the country proud.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to him and his teachings for this achievement.
T.
Sports play a big role in the overall humanity development.
There is no dearth of talent in the country.
If children are engaged in the field of sports in our family, we should give them an opportunity.
They should not be expelled from the plains and put in the room and urge them to study.
Let him study and do it, and prosper in it: but if he has greater talent or interest in sports, then all must encourage him to be in school, college, family, and in sports.
Everyone should dream of participating in the next Olympic Games.
Once again, my dear countrymen, during the rainy season and celebrations, it has been a time to create new experiences in a way.
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all and join you in the next Mann Ki Baat.
This year the summer temperature is an unforgettable experience.
At the same time, we are expecting rains.
When I am talking to you today, Ramlan started the holy month.
On this occasion of the holy month of Ramlan, I convey my heartfelt greetings to the people living in India and all over the world, especially to the people of Islamic community.
In the month of Ramalan, there is considerable importance of prayer, spirituality and devotion.
It is a matter of great pride for the 125 crore people of our country that all the religions of the world are in India.
We must consider that our ancestors have established this great tradition.
There are faithful in God, there are denying God in this country, there are idol worshippers, there are opponents of the idol.
The art of diverse emotions, variety of worshipping practices and variety of traditions have joined us.
Whether it is time, methods, philosophy, traditions, all these are the only messages that give us - peace, unity and harmony.
We will be able to move forward on the path of peace, unity and harmony in this holy month of Ramlan.
Once again I congratulate all of you.
I am happy that a lot of people have registered their backgrounds.
Everyone wants to share with me individually with enthusiasm about their experiences.
"I am talking to Diksha Gadkari.
I decided to read the habit of reading in vacations when I was almost released from me.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many sacrifices and struggles had to be carried out in India, how many martyrs had experienced the evils of prison.
I urge you to inspire the life of Bhagat Singh ji, who had made a big achievement in the younger age, so I would like to inspire you to send a message to the generations of today about this thing.
I am glad that the younger community is keen to know about our history and the martyrs of our freedom struggle and for the country.
Innumerable men have lost their youth in prison.
Many youngsters have kissed their sweets.
Today, we are able to breathe the breathing wind of a free India.
All the dignitaries who had spent their time in the freedom struggle, they wrote books, read and did all the great work, their writings have also played a very big role in liberating India.
Several years ago, I had visited the cellular jail in Andaman and Nicobar.
Today is the birthday of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a book Maji Janmade in jail.
He wrote poems on the prison walls.
He was locked in a small room.
Do they know what the liberators have suffered all the evils
Savarkar ji wrote Maji Janmade - only after I had to read the book, the urge to see the cellular jail was raised within me.
There they are organising a glimpse show, which is very inspiring.
Andaman Nicobar, known as Kalapani, was one of those who sacrificed their youth in jail, all the states, all the language speakers of India, faced a lot of pain.
My dear countrymen, on 5th June, the first Monday of the month.
Okay, what is it that connects to nature
For me, it is to connect us with us.
Connectivity with nature is to create a better land.
Who can express this better than Gandhiji.
Gandhijis once said, "One must care about a world one will not see, it is our duty to show concern about the unbelievable world we cannot see.
You must have experienced that I have the power of nature.
Perhaps you might have been very tired, and if you sprinkle the water in your face, then see how fresh you have achieved
The five ghosts that have produced our body, the new energy emerges when it connects with the five ghosts.
Therefore, on June 5, the world-class movement to connect with nature should be a movement to connect with us.
The Vedas have shown the earth and the environment on the basis of power.
The Adarvan Veda gives us a complete guidance to the environment in a way, which is thousands of years old.
: - Mother Earth: Butro Aham Prithivya: This is the case in our country.
It is said in the Vedas that the cleanliness that we have done is due to the earth.
There are several festivals in our country, several rituals of worship - the inhabitants of the country, the villagers of the city, the tribal community, the nature worship and the love of nature is a natural lifestyle.
However, it is necessary to understand it in contemporary terms and in contemporary terms.
I have a lot of news coming from the states.
With the rains in almost all the states, a massive movement of tree plantation begins.
Crores of trees are being planted.
This time we also have to give greater importance and contribution to the plantation work in this rainy season.
My dear countrymen, the 21st June is the day of the world to know well.
The world is celebrating it as World Day of Yoga.
In the shortest time of June 21, as World Yoga Day, it is spread all over the world that connects the world.
While separatist forces in the world are showing their worst faces, India's largest gift to the world is Yoga.
Through Yoga, we can connect the world to Orissa.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, mind and soul, Yoga can connect the world with Yoga.
Today, because of lifestyle, because of emergency, due to increasing responsibilities, because of pressure, life has become bigger.
We also see that this situation has happened in the childhood.
During the time of taking uncomfortable medicines and passing days, Yoga will help us to live a stress-free life.
Yoga is the medicine that guarantees both interest and physical interest.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible only through yoga if we say that we should experience such an inclusive journey by the body, by the mind, by the thoughts, by the habits and by the inclusive journey.
Two days ago, letters have been written to all the governments and leaders of the world on the occasion of Yoga Day.
Last year I had announced some competitions and some awards related to Yoga.
Gradually work is going on in this direction.
I convey my best wishes to the following suggestions I have been advised.
This is a very interesting thing.
On the next 3rd International Yoga Day, three generations of the family have asked me to practice Yoga together.
Three generations like Data Bati, Mother Father and son-in-law can join Yoga and welcome the photograph of this kind.
Yesterday, it will be a composite combination today and a new dimension to Yoga.
Yesterday, this will be tomorrow's film, which will guarantee a bright future.
I invite all of you.
As the International Day of Yoga remains for three weeks, start the exercise from today.
Share things related to Yoga for your share, spread, connect the people.
In a way, this is a predecessor health care mission.
I invite you all to join this.
From that day onwards, I have visited various parts of India.
I have taken care of the fact that Modi has done what he has done.
A funny phone call came to me, and I didn't think about the point of view that was said in it.
But thanks to me for creating such a different approach.
I hope that this phone call will happen to you as well.
Vanakam Modi ji, I speak from Mumbai to Naina.
I have often seen Modi Ji wherever you are going, the people there are focusing more on cleanliness in the television and social networks.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, the people have been listening to your invitation and are living in the form of a cleanliness movement as a society.
If the elders are on the one hand then there is also awareness about cleanliness among children.
Sometimes I have seen that their elders have been embracing the dirt in the streets.
After the launch of Swachhta Abhiyan in the ghats of Kashi, you got inspired by you and made it a magnificent form.
It is right to say that wherever I am going, all the government machines take up cleanliness, but now it has become a celebration of cleanliness in the society.
A substantial cleaning work is being done 5 days, 7 days and 10 days before I go.
The media also gives a lot of importance and a few days ago I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a massive Swachhta drive.
I didn't see it connected, but only after this phone call came to me, yes, yes, it's all right.
It is a pleasure to welcome the Prime Minister that all other preparations are going on, but it is a great pleasure to give importance to cleanliness.
It is a pleasure to all those who want cleanliness and conception.
I convey my best wishes to all those who strengthen the cleanliness.
One has given me a suggestion.
It's a funny suggestion.
The idea is good, but I have to think about it.
It is better to create a movement that I will remove so many tons of garbage, rather than paying goods.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to organise a very important campaign on waste management with the help of city representatives.
On the 5th of June, World Environment Day, around 4000 cities of the country will be able to collect solid waste and liquid waste.
There are two types of potholes, one green, second blue.
Two types of wastes are emerged - one liquid waste and other dry waste.
We have to follow the regulations and in 4000 cities, these utensils will be set up, the dry waste should be put in a blue basket, the liquid waste should be placed in a green basket.
In the kitchen waste, vegetables are unnecessary, sufficient food, eggs and leaves of trees, all the wastes should be put in a green utensil.
If we remember the colourful greenery of the fields then what should be planted in green utensils.
The second type of waste is paper bags, card boxes, iron goods, glass pieces, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken dumps, rubber products and metals - all these should be placed in the dry bags and restructured in the machines.
A few days ago, a matter came to the ear and the Versova Beach, which is considered to be a filthy beach in Mumbai, has become a clean and beautiful beach today.
For this purpose, Afroz Shah gave him the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) a great award.
He is the first Indian to receive the Champions of the Arth.
My dear countrymen, for the past 15 days and months, there have been discussions and analysis in the newspapers, TV channels and social media about the three-year activities of the current government.
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of the Chief Servant.
Several surveys have been conducted and a lot of polls have come up.
I see all these as very healthy symptoms.
During the last three years, every address was addressed.
People from all levels of society have also studied this.
This is a special activity in a democratic manner.
The obligation of the governments in the democracy is to submit my clear and obvious views to the people of the majestics the accounts of the work done.
I express my gratitude to all those who have supported and expressed their grievances and have immensely respected these things.
I also express my gratitude to those who have made significant backgrounds.
There is only a chance to be corrected when the crimes are expressed.
Be it good, be it less beneficial, be it bad, be it bad, be it learning from them, it can only lead to progress.
The positive criticism strengthens the democratic system.
This analysis and research is very important for a aware country, a country of academics.
Friends, My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you, everybody that is good as an ordinary citizen and is harmful to me, like any ordinary citizen.
Some people see Mann Ki Baat as part of the discussion, some criticize it in a political perspective, but when I have not seen it in the beginning that the Mann Ki Baat programme will change me from every family of India, I feel it after a long experience.
I feel like sitting in the middle of a family and talking about household matters.
I have been responsible for the President, the Vice President and the Speaker of Lok Sabha and all those who have been in such a higher position have given importance to Mann Ki Baat by excluding their golden time.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat has made me a new dimension.
Some of our friends had spoken to me sometimes when they were engaged in the work on Mann Ki Baat book.
I'm lending to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, the next time when we meet, the rainy season will come everywhere in the country, the results of the climate change, the results of the examinations will come, the learning will start again.
Come together, let us go ahead with nature in this environment.
My best wishes to all of you.
Every time such efficient inclusions come in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, detailed investigations are being carried out by the Government.
What kind of complaints is the experience of the people
We can usually see that giving suggestions to the next is the nature of human beings.
When we travel in trains and buses, if someone gets cough then it is natural for us to suggest that someone should do so immediately.
Initially, when consultations came to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the words of suggestions were seen in it, many were told that it would be a habit, but when we tried to reach it, I was really very happy in the flood.
After I mentioned the Narendra Modi App, in MyGov portal, you know what innovative methods have been initiated to prevent food from being wasted from every corner of the country.
I have not even seen that the younger generation of our country has been engaged in this work for a long time.
We know that some social organisations have been doing it for many years but the youth of my country have been engaged in it.
Many have sent me video.
Bread banking is being conducted in many places.
People offer bread from their side and bring vegetables and whoever is required, they come and get them.
The suppliers also do not have to think of themselves low.
This is an example of how collaboration in society is being done.
Today is the last day of April.
The foundation day of Gujarat and Maharashtra is coming in May.
On this occasion, my best wishes to the people of both the states.
Both the states are constantly trying to achieve new development peaks and have contributed to the progress of the nation.
In both the states, there have been constant emergence of great men and their lives in every field of society have been inspiring us.
Keeping in mind these great men, on the occasion of the Raising Day of the States, on the occasion of Independence of 2022, we should take the pledge of raising our states, our nation, our society, our city and our family at what level.
We have to move forward in collaboration with all the citizens and plans to fulfill this commitment.
I once again convey my best wishes to the people of both these states.
At one time, environmental change was a matter of only being spoken at the level of academics and seminars, but today, in our daily life, we have experienced it, we have immersed it.
Nature has changed the rules of its lap.
In the months of May-June, we had to experience the temperature in our country this time in the months of March-April.
While I was considering the suggestions of the people to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, there was a lot of suggestions about what we should do in the summer.
Though all things are known, it is not new, it is very beneficial to recall them at the right time.
Prasad Kumar Mishra, D.
In Balkani, they have said that water should be placed on the tops.
I have seen small children in the family doing this thing well.
If they think why water is to be filled, they will be seen ten times a day and if there is water in the vessel.
Besides this, the birds will come and drink water.
We can see it like a game, but in fact, the pinch is encouraging a wonderful experience of compassion in the minds.
In our country, birds and animals and natural composite life are natural, but at the same time, it is important to strengthen the efforts made at the social level.
While I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Sayedna Saheb of the Daudi Bohra community was 100 years old.
He lived for 103 years.
In order to celebrate his 100 years, the Bohra community organized a massive movement to protect the Gurus through the Burhani Trust.
Kinnas also got the place in the World Achievement Book.
Sometimes, if we are busy, we also forget to ask if you drink a mouth of water to drink the heat of this summer, whoever comes at our doorstep, whoever sells vegetables, whoever sells it, whoever sells it.
My young friends, I would like to share some things with you.
Sometimes I am worried that many of our younger generations want to live in a comfortable place and in a silky circle.
Parents are developing them in a very safe manner.
There is one such romance, but most of the people are in a circular circle.
Now the exams have been completed and you will have implemented schemes to spend holidays.
After the heat ends, summer holidays will be slightly sweet.
I am giving three suggestions to utilize your holiday period, the third of which you are special, but I am trying to do something in it.
Get a new experience, try to achieve a new ability, let's decide that no one should go to a place where he doesn't know, no one can see it, no one knows it.
New places, new experiences and new skills will be available.
Checking should be positive, come out of your circular circle.
We are from the middle class families, the happy family.
In the evening, take your football or tailor or take other sports items and go to the accommodation of the nearby poor.
Look at playing with the poor children there, you will feel that you can get the joy of playing in your lives so far.
Have you seen how big changes will be made in their lives when children who are enjoyed playing with you in such a poor society
Once you go, you will wish to go there again.
This experience will teach you many things.
Many autonomous organisations are engaged in service.
Search yourself together with the Kullu Guru and join yourself for 15 days and 20 days with some or the other.
Sometimes the summer camps will be held, the humanity development camps will be organized and various constructive camps will be organized and connect with them.
Learn to the poor who have no opportunity to learn that you have learnt freely and freely as a service after you have been selected in such camps.
You can teach them how to do.
Though technology has been considered to be far-flung and demolition of borders, the evil consequences of these are roaring my mind.
Six people are sitting in one room at the same house but they can't even imagine the distance between them.
Why
Everyone has been lazy due to technology.
Social nature is a good value and social nature is a power.
Another thing I have said is about the skills and don't you want to learn something new
Sometimes there is a fear that our younger generation is becoming a robot.
Friends, The dreams that we see in life are good things.
But we should not interpret the human elements within us, but keep in mind that we do not leave our humanity.
Whether we cannot focus on skill development
A little away from technology, we are trying to spend time with us.
If you don't know the swimming then you can learn the swimming, you can learn the map of the painting, you can't go to the best way, but in the paper it's a swimming stone
The feelings inside you start reflecting in it.
You will feel that all these talents and these activities will give you happiness, it will not only remove the restrictions on one side.
Do something different, friends
This is your opportunity to build your life.
After the completion of all the examinations, you said that after coming to a new position in your business, you said that if you thought that I would learn all this, then you would not have got that opportunity.
So I want to tell you that there is a country to learn Magic and learn the Situck Magic.
Do this to your friends.
If you do not know anything, try to learn it, it will definitely benefit you.
Awareness the creative capabilities within you, it will create a favourable platform for development.
Friends, I share my experience with you, we can't even imagine how many things we have to learn in the world.
There are many new places, new cities, new villages and new regions.
Don't imagine to travel too much.
Go and spend 3-4 days there, then go to the next place and spend 3-4 days there .
This will give you a lot of things to learn.
Friends, This time the Government of India has given you a very good opportunity.
The new generations have released almost cash transactions.
You are involved in this scheme but you can earn it through this scheme and do you know about a scheme of the Government of India
But someone else can recommend it.
You can connect others with this and if that new person makes three transactions through this then you will get an income of Rs. 10.
In your account, 10 rupees will be added to the government.
If you say that 20 people will be included in it one day then in the evening you will have 200 rupees.
Businessmen can also earn through this, and students will get income through this.
The project will be upto 14th October.
You can contribute to creating a Digital India.
You are the protectors of New India.
I got a very interesting phone call.
Salute Prime Minister, I talk to Shiva Saube from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I would like to talk about the red light.
I don't want to get stuck in the traffic crisis, I don't have to wait for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for your decision.
The government's decision to abolish the red light is an organizational step.
But this culture, which is furious in mind, has to be rooted out.
If all of us work together with awareness then it can be overcome.
When I say, my aim is clear - Ever Burson Is Important, everybody is important.
Every individual has a significance, if we accept the importance of 125 crore people, if we realize the importance of 125 crore people then there will be a great potential to realize the greatest dreams.
We have to do this together.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the 125 crore people of the country and Mahan Ramanuja.
Because of some reason, we've been stuck in the blankets, we've been more likely to think about the centuries.
It is also considered to be centuries in other countries of the world.
Just imagine.
Even today, it is so difficult to dismantle social conditions
How would it have been a thousand years ago
Some people knew that Ramanujer had created a big struggle against the situation of caste and the feeling of the bitterness of the society as the upper-deprived and the deprived.
Societies regarded whom they were not punished, followed and performed through their actions.
A thousand years ago, he campaigned for the entrance of his temple and successfully entered the temple.
The Government of India will release a Postage Stamp on 1st May to commemorate the commemoration of the Holy Shri Ramanujacharya.
I respectfully bow to the pious Ramanujacharya and showcase my devotional flowers.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is more important than 1st May.
In many parts of the world, workers follow it as a day.
When you talk about the day of labour, there is talk of labour and labour, originally I remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Today, we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect received by the workers.
Baba Saheb ji's contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb, we have got the opportunity to remember the great sacred and social reformer of Karnataka who lived in the 12th century, when we talk about the sacred Ramanujacharya.
There was a chance to release a collection of his golden languages.
In the twelveth century, he released deep comments on labour and labourers in Kannada language.
In the language of Kannada, he said, "Gaya Kave Kailash" means that only through hard work you can achieve the craft of Lord Shiva, that is, heaven will be achieved only by doing work.
While talking about the labourers, it is natural to think about them.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we are celebrating Buddha Purnima.
Those associated with Lord Buddha all over the world are happy to celebrate this festival.
The ideas of Lord Buddha are very suitable when the world looks at the violence, war, destruction and the conflict of arms that the world is facing today.
In India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent example of Buddha's breaking off the war.
This auspicious day of Buddha Purnima is celebrated by the United Nations Visak Diwas.
This year, the event will be held in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious day, I have the honour of dedicating my tributes to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
We talk especially for our neighbours.
We believe that our neighbours should be composed with neighbouring countries and they should also move forward.
There are many possibilities.
India is scheduled to launch South Asia Satellite on May 5.
The capabilities and facilities of this satellite will facilitate substantial support for the economy and development activities in South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
In every corner of the country, many families are united with the preparations for the examination of their children.
Today is 26th March.
We are proud that Rabindranath Tagore and his memories all of us are rich.
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was destroyed in 1919, at that time Rabindranath Tagore was one of the great men who shouted against the massacre.
The massacre had a profound impact on a balcony full of twelve years of age.
Three days before this day, on 23rd March, the British fired Bhagat Singh and his friends Sukdev and Rajguru
When this sad incident took place on March 23, there was no fear of death in the faces of martyrs such as Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
They gave all the dreams of life to the freedom of Mother India.
These three are still conscious of all of us.
We cannot bury the ears of the sacrifice of Bhagad Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words.
The whole of the British empire was interrupted by this three.
They were imprisoned and punished, but were worrisome about how to conduct them.
Several years ago, when I had got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt a kind of shock in that soil.
I urge the youth of the country to visit Punjab whenever you have the opportunity to visit Punjab, visit the place where the tombs of the mother of Bhagad Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagad Singh and Badkeshwar Dad are located.
It was a broad period of independence and its intensity.
On one hand, the soldiers like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were inspiring the youth to take up armed revolution.
About 100 years ago, in April, 1917, Gandhiji had launched Champaran Satyagraha.
This is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
For the first time in Champaran, the ideas of Gandhiji and the methods of Gandhiji were expressed in the freedom struggle of India.
This was a turning point in the journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the way of struggle.
It was the time when the thoughts and methods of Gandhiji began to show a deep impact on Champaran Satyagraha, Geta Satyagraha and Mill Workers strike in Ahmedabad.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot assess Champaran Satyagraha with the idea of Gandhiji in our minds.
Just imagine, one who returned to India in 1915, only two years of experience.
He highlighted the integration of Gandhijis through Champaran Satyagraha, the ability to know the vibration of the Indian society, the power to inspire the people of the poor and the uneducated, and the inspiring force against the British, and the inviting them to the battlefield.
We can learn from him how much public life should be started, how much work should be done and how Gandhiji worked.
The great leaders of that period, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Krupalani, had worked to go to the village of Gandhiji.
He learned how to connect the work done by the people with the freedom struggle.
Today we are traveling in the 21st century, whoever does not want to change India in today's era, whoever Indian does not want to participate in the transformation of the country
This candidature of 125 crore people and their efforts to transform them will be a strong foundation for themselves to build a New India.
New India is not a scheme of the government.
New India is the catalyst of 125 crore people.
This is the feeling of building a New India together with 125 crore people.
This is a desire, a desire, a feeling, a thirst, a desire and a thirst in the hearts of 125 crore people.
Peacefully, like those who have made penance, they are engaged in such work.
Many people go to the hospital everyday and help the patients.
As soon as the news is required, there are many people who donate blood from Ooty and donate blood.
There are also many who understand the good work of feeding them if someone is in the sword.
Our country is such a land of valuable gifts.
People's service is the Magason Service. This is everything in our nerves.
If we see it in a whole, then integratedly, how great it is, how great it is.
When we talk about the New India, criticism of this idea is a natural matter, it is possible to accept it democratically.
However, if 125 crore people are committed, if they decide their path then if they start taking the foundation of the new India then the dream of 125 crore people of cooking New India will start emerging when we are watching it.
It is not necessary that all things should be taken up in the budget, government plans or government money should be spent.
That is, I would like to say that every citizen of the country should perform his duties as a citizen and understand the responsibilities.
Why shouldn't we take this journey with regulation and devotion to a good testimony to our autonomy
Let me invite you to participate in this journey.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you today.
Over the last few months, people in our country have participated in the Digital Movement.
After the withdrawal of money, there is a lot of progress in the digital payment system.
We have started the BHIM App for 2-3 months so far, about one and a half crore people have left it.
My dear countrymen, we have to move forward in the fight against black money and corruption.
Can 125 crore citizens fulfill this year's commitment to digital transaction of Rs. 12 lakh crore
In order to implement this, we can make the school town digitally, we can take the ticket fees for travel by train or air, we can buy medicines digitally, if we are buying cheap foods, then we can take the way for digital transactions.
In the past, several programmes for Digital Festivals were organized for the awareness of the people.
A pledge was made to do 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been completed.
70,000 businessmen won the awards.
Everyone has a pledge to take this task forward.
A big bullshit is also being organized.
I am confident that we will create awareness about the BHIM App as much as the time has been left for Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
We have to contribute in reducing cash usage.
Friends, You have been giving me several suggestions every time I have asked you to suggest suggestions for the Mann Ki Baat programme.
But in your suggestions, I can see that you are always putting a lot of pressure on cleanliness.
This river passes through Risbana Bridge and it flows near my house.
We have moved to a part of the area against the pollution of the river and have tried to create awareness among the people who have travelled but there is no benefit from this.
I urge you to send a team from your side or create awareness about this matter through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, See how much pain is there in the mind of a girl studying in class 11.
I see it as a good symptom.
Cleanliness has also been awakened since the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Everyone has come together with them positively.
This has emerged as a mass movement.
The hatred against filth is increasing.
Be it aware, positive partnership and movement, the importance of these things is certain.
Though the work is hard, it must be done.
I am glad that this feeling of the new generation of the country, the children, the students and the youth is reflecting a good symptom.
Today, in the voice of my mind, whoever is listening to the thoughts of Gayatri, I would like to tell them all - the message given by Gayatri should be the message given to all of us.
Ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of the Mann Ki Baat programme, there are many suggestions about wasting meals.
We all know that when we are eating at our homes and public events, we are providing more food to our layers.
Have we ever seen how much we destroy from the rest of us
If we don't have the rest, do you think it will help the poor to feed
However, the morale shown in this regard is a great treason against society.
This is an injustice against the poor.
On the other hand, if there is no waste of food, there will be savings and the family will be economically benefited.
This is a good thing, even though it is socially thought, it is a beneficial thing, even though it is a family-oriented view.
I want to have greater awareness about this.
I know some youngsters who have started a mobile app and have started a campaign
If there is any food left, they shall be informed, and they shall collect the rest of the food and shall share it to the needy.
Our youngsters are doing the work done for this method of enhancing food.
You can meet such people somewhere in every state of India.
You can see the ways to change.
Awareness about the health of the body, they will always say that the leaf is slightly less and fills the stomach a little less.
World Health Day on 7th April.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030 has set a target of healthcare for all.
A study says that more than 35 crore people around the world are suffering from tension.
Talk to friends, to parents, brothers and sisters, openly to the teachers and talk to them within yourself.
Have you thought of why they're going on like this
Definitely understand that they are at the first stage of stress.
Depression, psychological and physical disorders.
Just as diabetes makes all kinds of diseases comfortable, as well as the energy that is possessing ourselves, fighting against severe environments, self-sufficiency and ability to decide.
If you are unable to speak to your dependents, then join the people with service at some place near you.
You can see yourself absorbing your sorrows with complete service, participate in their sorrows.
If you try to understand the sorrows of others, if you do it with a sense of service then you will inspire a self-confidence among you.
You can easily mix the burden of your mind by serving others with selflessness.
Similarly, Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
You start making efforts from now on.
Ensuring that millions of people participate in the Yoga drive socially.
If there is no suggestion in your mind about the third International Day of Yoga, you must send your suggestions to me through the mobile app, guide me.
You can create songs and compositions related to yoga, so that people can understand.
Today I want to talk to mothers and sisters about one thing and today we have talked about many things about health.
In the past, the government has taken a big resolution.
It is a welcome thing that the number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and their participation is increasing.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of April, the holy Ramanavami, on the 9th of April, Mahavir Jayanti, on the 14th of April, the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji.
May the lives of these great men always inspire us and inspire us to cook a New India.
After the spring, when the crops begin to grow, the farmers will get the benefit of their hard work.
In many corners of our country, this new festival is celebrated in many ways.
My best wishes to you all for the New Year.
The rainy season is now vanishing.
Spring time is registering its arrival in the life of all of us.
After the leafying season, new blooming of trees has started, flowers are blooming, jungles and gardens are all greenery.
Not only flowers, but also sugarcanes brighten in his garland.
Mangani's pinches have started appearing in the spring season.
The turmeric flowers of mustard in the fields give the farmers confidence.
The floral flowers of flowers and holiflowers are guided to visit the festival.
Ameer Kusru has described these moments of climate change.
The crops of mustard bloom all over the fields, the animals bloom, the flowers of the buffaloes, the buffaloes cry, the buffaloes cry, the environment will be comfortable when they bloom in the natural buffaloes, the humans also benefit from the sweetness of this environment.
Vasanta Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holip festivals blossom flowers in the life of man.
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and human love, we are going to complete the month of Bhagni and we are ready to welcome the new month of New Year.
Spring season is a combination of these two months.
Whenever I hear your suggestions before Mann Ki Baat, I first express my gratitude to millions of people of the country for helping me send a lot of suggestions.
I am grateful to all of you who have contributed in the Prime Minister's App, in the tweet, in the Facebook and in all forms of letters.
Shoba Jalan ji mentioned in the Narendra Modi App that many people did not know about the achievements of the ISRO.
He further urged you to inform about 104 satellites and intermediate satellites.
Shobaji is grateful to you for reminding me of the pride of India.
Our scientists have made India a chest on the world stage.
We all know that ISRO has succeeded in achieving many wonderful achievements over the past few years.
After the success of sending Mangalya to the planet on Tuesday, ISRO has made a new world achievement in the space sector a few days ago.
At the same time, 104 satellites have been successfully launched in India.
This is a great historic achievement not only for ISRO but for the entire India.
ISRO's low-cost space programme is one of the miracles of the world and has praised the success of Indian scientists all over the world.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is very important - Cartosat-2D, which will help India's satellites, its photographs, identification of mineral resources, infrastructure, developmental assessment and planning for urban development.
Our new Satellite Cartosat-2D will help my farmer brothers and sisters to know about all the things related to how to use them and how to take care of them.
As soon as we reached, our satellite has sent some films.
It started working on its work.
It is a matter of great happiness that all these activities have been under the leadership of our young social scientists and our women scientists.
This great contribution of young scientists and women scientists is a matter of great pride for ISRO's success.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists of ISRO on your behalf, the people of the country.
Your goal of implementing space science keeping in mind the country's work for the people is to continue to be the same as today and you are making several new achievements every day.
Whatever admiration has been given to our scientists and their entire team, there is a shortage of them all.
India has successfully tested the continent-breaking missile in the defence sector.
This is the biggest achievement in the defence sector.
You will be happy to note that this technological potential in the world is only four and a half countries in the world.
Indian scientists have achieved this.
Its strength is that even though a missile has been hit by India from a distance, it is capable of destroying this missile.
We are happy to see new technologies and see some new scientific achievements.
In the universe, the mind of man has been making an uninterrupted effort to know the rules of creation.
New science and new technologies are born from this.
Every technology has created a new era in the form of every new science.
Friends, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often expressed my heart that our younger generation should attract science.
Many scientists need the nation.
Today's scientists are the factors of a sustainable change in the lives of generations that emerge in the future.
None of the scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific emerges.
All scientific achievements have been done by experience.
The Honourable Bapu ji has said that we should appreciate the thirst, imagination and sacrifice of our modern scientists who have worked hard.
The need of the public should be to make the principles synthesis, tools and tools of what kind of technologies can be made so that it can be an important contributor to the common man.
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of India had organized a very special competition on 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
In Mumbai, there was a lot of rain in 2005, the floods and the oceans were showered in anger and there was a lot of hurdles.
If there is any natural place then it is the first doors of the poor house.
Both decided to find a solution, they saved the house in a long time and saved the householders from floods and developed a house that could protect them from water-related diseases.
I could see a lot of innovations like this.
I am sure that many people have been making this kind of contribution in the country.
Our society is also becoming a society with the help of technology.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
Digital attention has been given in the past.
Gradually, people are moving from cash transactions to digital transactions.
Digital transactions in India are growing rapidly.
In particular, the young people are making digital payments in their mobile phones.
I see this as a good symptom.
In the past, we have received a lot of welcome in our country for the Lakhi Grahag Yojana, fortunate consumer scheme, Digital Business Yojana and Digital Business Scheme.
During nearly two months, 15,000 people have received an amount of Rs. 1,000 per day.
Through these two schemes, digital procurement in India is becoming a mass movement and the entire country is welcomed to doubling it.
So far, under the Digital Scheme, 10 lakh people have received a reward, more than 50,000 traders have received a reward, more than one and a half crore rupees have been provided to those who have participated in these schemes.
Under this scheme, more than a hundred traders have received one lakh rupees per day.
More than 4000 traders have received Rs. 50,000 per day.
Various people like farmers, businessmen, small entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, householders and students have been associated with it with great enthusiasm and they have benefitted from it.
When I noticed this, it was known that not only the youth but also the elderly had participated in it, including a 15-year-old man and a senior citizen of 65-70 years.
Santosh ji has expressed his happiness in the Narendra Modi App from Mysore and has said that he has received Rs. 1000 through the Lakhi Grahak Yojana.
But I would like to share with you what I think is important in his writing.
Santosh ji, your name and your work gives us happiness.
You have done a great inspiration.
Sabir, a 22-year-old car driver from Delhi, has started using digital transactions in his business after demonetisation and has received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh in the government's fortunate client scheme.
Today, even though he drives a car, he has turned into an ambassador of this scheme.
He shares information about digital transactions with travellers and travellers in his car.
He is excitingly sharing things and inspiring others.
Pooja Nemade, a young friend from Maharashtra, is a student who is a student who shares his experiences with his friends about how his family uses Rupee Card and e-Wald.
Come to lead this movement.
You take this forward, it has an important role in the fight against corruption and black money.
All those who join themselves in this work are new warriors against corruption in my eyes.
In a way you're the warriors of honesty.
On the 14th of April, the greatest awards will be held.
There are more than 40-45 days left.
Can you do a job to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
A few days ago, Baba Saheb had passed the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.
To recognise his memories, teach at least 125 people to be given BHIM App.
This time, on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the BHIM App has become a special significance
I also want to mention that we should strengthen the foundation of Baba Saheb.
You should ensure that the BHIM App is being taken into the hands of 125 crore people by going home and connecting everyone with it.
Due to the impact of this movement in the last two-three months, there has been a huge increase in many cities and villages.
Friends, Farming is a synonym of the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the villages is strengthening the economic pace of the country.
I would like to share a happy information with you today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled the field.
This year, due to the hard work of the farmers of our country, there has been an unprecedented crop.
All indicators indicate that our farmer brothers and sisters have defeated the old achievements.
On seeing Mahsul, every day it starts appearing as if we celebrate the festival of Pongala and Paisahi today.
This year, more than 2,200 lakh tonnes of masul has been received.
This is 8 percent higher than the last achievement of our farmers.
This is a wonderful achievement in itself.
I would like to particularly thank the farmers of the country.
There is another reason why I thank the farmers - they have cultivated a variety of pulses in addition to cultivating traditional food, because pulses are more proteinful.
The voice of the poor has fallen in the ears of my farmers, they have cultivated a variety of pulses in about two hundred hectares of land.
This is not just the production of pulses but it is a great service to the farmers of my country for the poor.
I express my gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of the country who have achieved pulses and pulses in the masoor.
Dear countrymen, in our country, through the government, through the society, through the organisations, everybody is traveling towards cleanliness.
In a way, everybody has been aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government is engaged in uninterrupted efforts.
In the last few days, under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, a function for senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
The seminar was not held within the closed rooms of Varanasi in Telangana, but the importance of cleanliness at the bottom was to be implemented.
During 17-18 February, training was started to harass toilets in Hyderabad.
Officials showed how to reuse the toilets in 6 households, they were cleaned and removed from the toilets with two drains and bring them back to use.
They showed how facilitating the toilet using this new strategy, there was no problem, no problem, no physical obstacles, no obstacles.
The way we are cleaning usually, the toilets can also be cleaned.
A family with 6 members, an average dual toilet will be filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be removed easily and returned to the second tail.
How many things are shown in it will be beneficial.
Even in the government, various sectors have been organising meetings related to cleanliness once a week.
In the first meeting to be held in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will jointly strengthen the Swachhta Mission.
In the second meeting of March, the Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will collaborate with the Ministry of Shipping for the last two weeks of March.
If any citizen works well in our country, the entire country feels a new energy and encourages self-confidence.
We welcomed the adventures of our talented sportspersons in the Rio Paralympics.
The T-20 World Cup for those who were not visually impaired this month, defeated India in Pakistan and became the world champion for the second time and proud of the nation.
Once again I congratulate all the soldiers who have been present.
We are proud of the achievements of our Divyang friends in the country.
I have always been convinced that our disabled brothers and sisters are highly skilled, mindful, accomplished, accomplished and minded.
Every moment we have to learn from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the women of our country are not slaves.
They are moving ahead with the sacred sacred sacrificiality of the country through their achievements.
Our female heroines have won silver medals in the Asian Rakbi Sevens Games in the last few days.
My extensive congratulations to all these heroes.
World Women's Day is celebrated on 8th March.
In India, understanding should be enhanced and enhanced in the family and society to give importance to women children.
Today it is not just a government scheme.
As a social understanding, it has been transformed into a movement of education for all.
In the last year, this scheme has linked the society to the people, has kept thinking about this important thing in every corner of the country, has transformed the mindset of the people about the old habits of decades.
There is a lot of joy in the ears when the celebrations take place after listening to the news that the child is born.
In a way, positive thinking about women children has become a cause of social conception.
I heard that due to a special campaign in Tamilnadu district, Balaya marriage has been stopped.
So far, more than 175 slaughter marriages have been stopped.
The district administration has started bank accounts in the name of more than 55-60,000 women children under the Suganya Samruthi scheme.
As per the integrated model of Convergence Model in Jammu and Kashmir district, all the sectors have been linked to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, the Gram Sabhas will be convened and all efforts are being made by the district administration to adopt and ensure their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a campaign is being taken for the education of every household girl child in every village.
In the state of Rajasthan, our children, our schools, the movement is being implemented and the movement is being carried out to re-insert and re-insert women who have stopped schooling.
I am saying that the movement of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao is taking various forms of work.
This entire movement has become a mass movement.
It is travelling together with innovative ideas.
This is being revised according to regional needs.
I consider this as a good sign.
On the occasion of Women's Day of March 8, we should be united with the feelings of the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of the country, the people of Mann Ki Baat and sometimes you all get the opportunity to talk about something or the other.
You have been positively associated with this.
I have got a lot of things to learn from you.
All the feelings of the world, the condition of the villages and the feelings of the poor have come to me.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
In any situation, our ancestors have made the system of cycle, economic cycle and social life very well, so that there should never be a recession in society.
In the last few days, we have celebrated several festivals.
Even after thousands of years, every festival, with a new spirit, with a new inspiration, has filled the new energy in itself.
Sometimes he took up the mountain, sometimes used to remove the leaf of food, that is, in every activity of him, we can feel an innovation.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, my child is going to milk two Mohans.
One of them is Sudarshan Chakra, Mohan and the other is beating Sarka.
Mohan, who crossed the Sudarshan Chakra, crossed the Yamuna river, went to the coasts of Gujarat and was established in Dwarai city, but Mohano, who was born on the coasts of the sea, came to Yamunu and breathed his last in Delhi.
Mohan, who crossed the Sudarshan Chakra, used his intellect, his duties, his ability and his thoughts to avoid the war, and to live without conflict, even thousands of years ago, according to the circumstances of that period.
At the same time, Sarka bearing Mohano gave a new shape to the freedom struggle to secure the country's freedom, to protect human values, to empower the fundamental elements of humanity and to create a new turn to the entire world, it is still unique.
The significance of selfless service is the significance of wisdom, what is the significance of proceeding with smoke in the midst of all the highlights of life, we can learn from the life of Lord Krishna.
Today, while we are talking about festivals, India is participating in a big celebration
Not only India but the whole world is talking about it.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Annal Gandhiji.
On October 2, 1869, at Porbandar on the coast of the sea, today we have created a war, not an individual at a small house called Kirti Mandir.
This has given a new turn to the entire human history and achieved a new achievement.
One thing was always associated with Gandhiji, in a way it was a permanent part of his life, that is the duty of service, service and service.
If we had seen his entire life, he was involved in the service of the people of different communities in South Africa, and in that period, there was no small thing.
He served the oppressed farmers in Champaran area.
If anybody requires any help, he will be helpful to serve at any time.
He not only strengthened the service but also strengthened the spiritual pleasure associated with service.
But along with this, the experience of a self-reliant experience of enjoyment and happiness is also in service.
This is what we can clearly understand through the life of the eye.
Individuals, society and humanity are all for Gandhijis.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix farm, or the Dalsty farm, or the Sabarmati Ashram, or the Varta, he has always been strengthening the social unity in a different way in everywhere.
I believe that I have got the privilege of paying homage to many important places related to Annaloda.
When it comes to society, there is a strength for it and this event of Gandhi 150 should be a social expression and service.
Whatever the mind feels, it should be a good wish, a good objective, a harmony, a complete dedicated service, a free: comfortable: - a relentless joyful experience.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago I had visited Dandi in Gujarat.
Dandi, the name of the Salt Satyagraha in the freedom struggle, was one of the biggest turning points.
In Dandi, I inaugurated the state-of-the-art museum dedicated to the field.
I urge all of you to travel to some place related to Gandhiji.
Several events, competitions and exhibitions have been planned in the coming days.
But on this occasion, I would like to share a very interesting thing with you.
This time, at Venice Biennale, there are many interesting exhibitions filled with the memories of Gandhiji.
The area of Haripura is specially interesting.
You might remember that during the Haripura Congress conference in Gujarat, the event that was elected as the president of Subhas Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
There is a very beautiful past in these arts.
Before the Congress's Haripura conference in 1937-38, the then Chief Minister Nandlal Bose was invited to Shantiniketan's Kala Bhawan.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people living in India and showcase this artefact at the conference.
This is the hand of Nandla Bose, the beauty of our Constitution.
Nandlal Bose surrounded the villages attached to Haripura and finally presented paintings to showcase rural life.
There were serious discussions in Venice about these invaluable works.
Once again, with my best wishes on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I hope that every Indian should take some pledge.
For the country and for the society, something should be done for some good thing.
This is the best and true activity that we can do for the field.
Brothers and sisters, You must remember that in the last few years, we have been organising the Swachhta Hi Seva movement for two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start on 11th September.
On this mission, there is enthusiasm in all sections of the society.
My business brothers and sisters, all of them have put an announcement in their shops and have written in it that the customers should come out of the house with courage.
This will save money and also contribute to protecting the environment.
This time, on 2nd October, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of the eye, on this occasion, we will dedicate to India that is free from the habit of open defecation, while setting the foundation stone of a new mass movement against fire materials across the country.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every town, every town and every town of the country to salute Hakkupi and celebrate this year on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti in a way with the aim of liberating this mother of India.
I also appeal to private corporations that you should come forward to evacuate these things in a suitable manner after the collection of such luggage materials.
They can be restructured.
They can produce fuel.
But there was a lot before.
Today, I would like to touch a more important thing than a Sanskrit Golden Language.
Despite the fact that it was written several centuries ago, even today, how important is it
The monkeys call stones as gems.
Food has always been given great importance in our culture.
Whatever extent, we have also made the knowledge of food science.
Equitable and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and children, because they are the future foundations of our society.
Nutrition Mission, i.e. nutrition in modern ways across the country, is becoming a mass movement.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and interesting ways.
Once a thing was brought to my attention.
A massive movement was launched in Nashik.
In these days, Anganwadi brothers and sisters collect a handkerchief from the people.
These cereals are useful for hot food prepared for children and women.
This is done when the child is being given a strong food for the first time.
Not a liquid food, solid food.
This is a wonderful endeavour, it can be implemented everywhere.
In many states, people are organising the movement of Didhi Poshan.
Whether it is the birthday of the family, whether it is an independent day or a commemorative day, the family members go to Anganwadi by preparing nutritious food, tasty food, they go to schools, where the family members change their own children and feed them.
They share their joys and do not reduce when they share their happiness.
With the sense of service, the feeling of joy is a wonderful confluence.
Friends, Through such small things, we can end the strong war against malnutrition in our country.
Today, due to lack of awareness, the poor and the self-reliant are suffering from the lack of nutrition.
We will celebrate the month of September as a nutrition drive throughout the country.
Definitely connect you with this, get information, get new ideas in it.
If you have brought one or two persons out of malnutrition, then we can bring the country out of malnutrition.
When I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat this time, I was very confident that questions about this matter will be heard.
Moreover, in the last few weeks, whenever I visit, whenever I met the people, Man Vs Wild was talked about.
I have not even imagined that I will get such an opportunity to take place in the minds of the youth of the world.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
Whenever I have the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister, however the situation has become because of International Yoga Day, if you go to the world, you can ask me about Yoga for 5-6 minutes.
So far, I have been aware of the fact that there is no conservative world leader in Yoga. This is my experience all over the world.
But now there is a new experience.
Whenever I meet, whenever I get the opportunity, they talk about the issues related to wildlife, they are involved in environmental discussions.
The discovery programme is being organized by 165 countries in their language.
But one more interesting thing is that some people are asking me a thing with a little bit of trouble, Modi ji, you are speaking in Hindi, when Beer Grills did not know the Hindi language, how could you talk so fast
Is it subsequently inserted into the collection
Look, there's no secret in it.
The fact is that technology was fully used to interact with Bear Grills.
After this event a large number of people have started discussing with me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must also go to places associated with nature and wildlife .
I had already said that I will repeat it now and you must visit the North-Eastern states in your life.
Your life is vast.
Your thoughts will grow.
I had the privilege of releasing wild leopards in the past months.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
The number of LTTEs in India is 2967.
A few years ago, half of it was their number.
The LTTE-related summit was held in Russia's St. Petersburg in 2010.
It was expressed concern over the decreasing number of LTTEs in the world and concluded.
This is the commitment to double the number of LTTEs across the world by 2022.
But because of this New India, we are at a rapid pace with targets, we have doubled the number of tigers present here in 2019.
India has not only increased the number of LTTE but also the number of protected areas and social security forces.
When I released LTTE data, I remembered the lions in the Gir forests of Gujarat.
I had taken over as the Chief Minister there and the residence of lions in the Gir forests was decreasing.
Their numbers were also decreasing.
We took action one after the other in the jungles of Kir.
In 2007, we decided to take over the women's guards.
We have made developments in the infrastructure to increase tourism.
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife, we only talk about maintenance.
Therefore, it is necessary that we not only protect our forests, vegetations and wildlife but also create a proper environment to help them live in a better way.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
This young saint of India, who raised humanity from sleep all over the world, has left a glimpse of India in the world.
The slave India that the world saw, the same world changed the vision of India by listening to the words of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893.
Come, let's see what Swami Vivekananda had seen in India, what Swami Vivekananda had seen in India, we will be trying to live.
It is within us, everything is there, we will proceed with self confidence.
My dear countrymen, on August 29, we are celebrating the National Sports Day.
This will be yours. This will be a very interesting movement for children, elders, youth and women.
But I'm not going to say anything about their smooth things today.
I would like to create an awareness about the body in your mind, for a stable India, for our nation, we will together decide some goals.
I am confident that all of us will be able to get rid of the weighing products, in every place outside the house, and in the social web sites, we will be shouting about it.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, salute all of you.
On the 26th of January, we celebrated our President with joy and joy all over the country.
In a way, the Constitution of India, the obligations of the citizens, the duties, the powers and the democracies of our democracy, it is a cultural festival and awakens them by creating awareness on democratic responsibilities for the future generations.
But even now, there is no more extensive and deep debate on the duties and rights of citizens in our country.
Tomorrow, on 30th January, the day of our saluting fields is a day of disappearance.
On 30th January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, let us all celebrate 2 minutes of silence and salute our memories to the martyrs of the country.
As a society, as a nation and as a nation, it should be natural for us to pay silent tributes at 11 a.m. on January 30.
It's just two minutes but it has sociality, mindset and the expression of our concern on martyrs.
We have expressed natural respect for our country's military and security forces.
I convey my best wishes to the warriors and their relatives who have been awarded the medals for the brave gallantry awarded on the occasion of the President of India.
These medals include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
I urge the youth, especially the youth, to do a job that you are working simultaneously on the social workforce.
This time, on the web site, ask for those soldiers who are honoured and write two good words and share them with your friends.
We will be surprised, proud and inspired when we know the messages of the courage, valour and valour of those soldiers.
While we have experienced great enthusiasm and joy in the news on January 26, on the other hand, some of our military personnel engaged in the security of our country in Kashmir have died due to snowfall.
I pay homage to all the soldiers who have died in this.
My young friends, you all know that I have been constantly singing the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
These four months of January, February, March and April have been challenging for every family.
Even though there is a choice for a child at home, the entire family is crying on the burden of examinations.
I always feel that I should come out of this situation, so today I want to talk to my young friends in detail.
I would like to ask you how to make such an environment happy.
He has asked this question but I know that this question is in your minds.
Exams must be a happy occasion.
The exam period for most of them has been a period of pressure.
Whether you consider it a happy time or not, you must decide whether you feel it a time of pressure.
Those who consider it a time of pressure, they feel sad - please for pressure.
Therefore, I believe that the time of election is a festival and a festival.
Whenever the festival is celebrated, the specialty of the festival is emerged in us.
The entire family should work as a group and enthusiastically contribute to the success of this festival.
There will be changes when you keep watching.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kachh to Kamrupam, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a single examination in these 3-4 months.
It is the responsibility of all of us to transform these three-four months to everybody in their own ways, to follow their traditions, to their family environment.
If you say that you were glad, if you were with your face to face, you would feel your breath, in this situation, even the old things of many years will start smoothly in your memories.
A year ago, what the teacher had said in the classroom will be lightened in your mind.
Sindhana Shakti will be established and it will start dreaming with a burden.
If I feel it, I feel it, if we are stressed, we forget things, if we are confident, we can't even imagine how many things will suddenly come into mind.
Whether you don't have any knowledge or knowledge, you don't work hard.
But when there is pressure then your knowledge, your knowledge, all your knowledge will faint and pressure will ride on you.
That's why I'll say a happy mind is the secret for a good mark-sheet, the opening of more values.
Sometimes I see that we don't get the exams from the right point of view.
This is not a speech for your life.
How did you live your life, how you live your life and how you want to live your life, it is not an exemplary choice.
J.
Abdul Kalam ji is a great example of conception for us.
He went to the Air Force and failed.
The values have become very important.
This has led to increasing pressure on the minds of the students.
In this situation, I would like to know your views on the contemporary tendency and future of education.
If you believe in these things, then the values will be buried behind you like the winds of the wind
Until yesterday, it is necessary to know where I have reached today.
If you talk about the world of sports, I have shown this example because it will be reminded immediately.
Most of the sportspersons compete with themselves.
You can take the life of Sachin Tendulkar
He has consistently defeated several achievements for 20 years and has achieved a new achievement every time he has achieved the previous achievement.
His journey to life is very wonderful because he has been following the path of making himself challenges by competing with others.
Friends, You have to write your exams in every field of life and if you have to study for 2 hours then you can study for 3 hours
You have decided to get up in the morning and it may have been delayed, but can you get up at the time you have decided
Therefore, I urge you to compete with others and make yourself challenges.
It should be kept in mind how my work was earlier, how I should move forward and how to work well.
With this perspective, you can facilitate your changes.
S.
Sundar ji, it's all right to say you.
You might have noticed that even today, those who ask me questions, those who give me advice, you might have noticed that there is more number of women in it.
Because when we see how many mothers are aware about the future of children in the house, they are making many things easier.
Be guided by your capabilities, you shall be guided and all your works shall be, you shall be guided.
Once you are admitted, most of your problems will come to an end.
The expectations of parents and teachers are accustomed to their problems.
Acknowledgement of the same is the way to solve the problems.
The expectations make the path more difficult.
You will enjoy the burden and enjoy it.
In a way we see the patient and we fear the disease.
I would like to tell my parents that at some times we are afraid of such a situation with our children.
Have you ever emerged that you should create a joyous environment on the day of examination.
Please, you will see the change in the environment completely.
I got a wonderful phone call.
He doesn't want to mention his name.
You will know why he doesn't want to mention his name.
Salute Prime Minister, I don't want to mention my name because of one thing I have done in my childhood.
Once there is a habit of savings, the thirst to learn in life will go away.
A telephone call was received: "Congratulations to the Prime Minister, my name, Monica. I would like to ask you two questions about my exams because I was studying in class 12.
It is a common concept that if students focus on sports, there will be a lack of attention to education.
This is the basic idea that is wrong, it is the result of the problem.
If we call for a complete development then there is a life beyond singing scriptures, which is very wide.
This is the right time to live and learn that life.
If it's five minutes, you must have some rest.
You can feel that your work is uncomfortable.
I don't know whether everyone has caught it or not, but this is my experience.
During the election season, when I speak on platforms, sometimes my voice will not be able to collaborate.
Once a native singer came to meet me.
He asked me how long you were sleeping.
Till now, I have never seen that my speech and my voice will be connected, he gave me the basic treatment.
If we understand the importance of such fundamental matters then we will get many benefits.
Do not do this, otherwise your family goes to anger with me.
If you don't see the day when your maiden is coming, I'll see them in their eyes.
Please don't do that.
This is the biggest medicine to keep mind, intelligence and body active.
Okay, young friends, while you are engaged in the arrangements for your exams, I am talking about something and I hope that if I have said today, I will be able to give you relief.
But I urge you not to bear the burden of what I have said.
If possible, don't do it.
Remember your resolution, believe in you, go to your election, my best wishes to all of you.
Before facing every challenge, transform that challenge into a celebration.
Then the challenge will not be the challenge.
Take this mantra in mind and move forward.
My dear countrymen, on 1st February 2017, the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard is being completed.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to the Coast Guard officers and the soldiers for the gathering for their country.
It is a matter of pride that our Coast Guard with 126 ships and 62 aircraft is 4 in the world's four largest coastal defence stations.
The mantra of the Coast Guard is Vayam Rakshaam.
Coast Guards are awake at night in the dramatic conditions of the country to defend the coastal and sea shores of the country by achieving their goal.
Many people don't know that not only men but women are successfully performing their duties on their shoulders in the coastal areas of our country.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard are airplanes or surveillance personnel and are operating Hovergraphy.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the Indian Coast Guard on their 40th anniversary today, as the Coast Guard is the world's biggest topic.
Bastar Panchami is a great festival for Saraswati Pooja in our country.
It is considered an opportunity to appreciate education.
Not only this, it is a time to inspire the soldiers.
Mera Rang de Basanti Sola, make me a spring suitable - this is an inspirational idea.
I convey my best wishes to my countrymen on the auspicious occasion of this holy spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the sky has always blossomed new colors and new colors in accordance with its creativity.
Immediately after the completion of my Mann Ki Baat for the last two months, they have spread the voice of Mann Ki Baat in the state languages.
This is a very welcome.
I have had a great opportunity to travel together with you through Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, greetings and best wishes to you all on Christmas Day.
Today's service, sacrifice and compassion have to be given importance in our lives.
Several wealthy people came and gave a united wealth.
In the end, a poor widow came and put two snakes of cows.
Today, on his birth anniversary, we will pay homage to him.
Two days ago, I was fortunate to inaugurate several development works in Malaviya ji's penance, Varanasi.
I laid the foundation stone for the prestigious Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Centre, which will be set up, will not only be the Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today, Bharat Ratna is also the birthday of former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will not forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we are also proud of the country in the nuclear sector.
Atal ji's distinguished contribution as a party leader and as a Member of Parliament, through the post of minister or prime minister has made him an example.
Today, on the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I convey my warm greetings to him and to give him a good health.
As an employee, I had a great deal of work with Atal ji.
The memories of him are green in front of my hearts.
Today, the Christmas family is providing benefits of two schemes for the people of the country.
If you see in a way, you can see both of them as the beginning of new projects.
Whether it is the village, the city, the readers, the merchants, the cashless transactions, how to do cashless business, how to know the things related to the purchase of goods without cash, we can see that the entire country is present.
Everyone wants to learn the methods related to this from each other.
Likewise, the Digital Business Programme, which has been designed to encourage traders, will be awarded to 15,000 persons in the form of Christmas Award on 25th December.
This project will be held from today to 100 days.
Every day 15,000 persons get prizes per thousand rupees per day.
Digi's business programme is mainly for traders.
Business of traders will also have a luxurious opportunity to lay down the money.
This scheme is designed by concentrating all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class.
Those who buy goods worth Rs. 50 to Rs. 3000 will get the benefit of this.
The buyers don't have this.
The poor people of the market can buy and sell the goods using USSDs, feature phones and simple phones, they can pay the amount and all of them will be benefitted by this scheme.
People in rural areas can buy or sell goods through AEPS and win prizes.
Today, there are about 30 crore RuPay cards in India, out of which 20 crore cards are of poor families and people who have their accounts.
These 30 crore people will soon be able to participate in this award programme.
I am sure that the people of the country will take the country in this process and they will be enthusiastic to get the necessary information from the youth around them.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy to see the spread of awareness about how technology is being used in the country, how to pay electronic money and how to pay online money.
Over the past few days, cashless business has grown up by 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to take this forward.
Businessmen are very well aware of how big this resolution is.
The businessman who buys digital payments, instead of using cash in his business, is paying income tax concessions to such traders.
I congratulate all the states and Union Territories of the country.
A group headed by Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, has been formed and they are considering several schemes.
At the same time, the governments have also started several schemes in their own way and are implementing them.
I am told that the State Government of Assam has announced that wealth tax and business licensing fees will be given to the digitally paiders by 10.
If the branches of rural banks carry their 75 percent accountants, at least two digital transactions from January to March, the government will pay an amount of Rs 50,000.
The Committee has announced that Rs. 5 lakhs will be disbursed as the best Panchayat for Digi Payments from the Government to the villages, which have achieved 100 digital payments by 31st March, 2017.
Several organisations are working successfully to take up digital payments for rural poor farmers.
The interesting thing is that this year's sales increased by 27 percent compared to GNFC's fertilizer sales last year.
In the case of availability of Rs. 100, Rs. 80 and Rs. 80 are available at a place where they are deprived of insurance and health facilities.
But now money is being paid in a cashless manner.
Our country is a young majority.
Technology is our handicapped art.
A country like India should be at the forefront of all the countries in this region.
Our youth have seen significant progress through start-ups.
This is a golden opportunity for digital movement.
Our youngsters should add to the new ideas, intellectual technologies and modern methods that can be strengthened in this sector.
At the same time, it should be linked to the movement of black money and corruption with full force.
My descendants, I used to ask you before the voice of Mann Ki Baat every month that you should seek your advice and show your thoughts
Thousands of letters, according to this, have come into consultation with MyGov and narendramodiap, of which 80-90 percent of the suggestions are related to corruption and black money evasion and currency relaxation.
After seeing all this, I feel that they can be used in three ways.
Some people have written in detail about the problems and difficulties that the citizens have suffered due to this withdrawal.
On the other hand, they mentioned how they would take up new ways to lay the foundation stones and unrestrained activities in many places, in such a way that the work done for the welfare of the country and the sacred work done for the welfare of the country.
You have written so many letters to me, my people, and I am grateful for this.
This way of bringing black money under control is commendable.
Though it is true that all of us are suffering from civilians, we all have fielded the fight against corruption and our cooperation in this war gives us happiness.
We are fighting against corruption and black money, the military forces are fighting like fighting,' Gurumani Kewal ji recorded his views on the mygov site.
Guru Mani Kewal ji has written the voice of people reflecting every corner of the country.
They are the factors, agents of change.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the beneficiaries who have not only tolerated many difficulties but also to those who have been trying to take the people to the wrong direction.
A massive effort was made to cultivate the war against corruption and black money.
Not only this, many jumped on the ground and used their creation and innovation and snatched the fashions of the spreaders and showed the truth.
When 125 crore people of my country are connected to me, can there be something impossible
If the blessings of the majestic people, is it not the blessings of Is it
I express my gratitude to the people of the country, salute them and people have been participating in this Mahayaga against corruption and black money with full enthusiasm.
I had hoped that this war against corruption and black money in Parliament will be widely debated for political parties about the funds given to political parties.
If the sessions were held in the House, there would have been a discussion on it.
Whoever insists that political parties have been exempted in all ways, it is absolutely wrong to say.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money are spending their full attention and time in search of government grievances.
There is also a question of why the rules are changing.
This government is working for the people of Magazars.
The government has been working in an effort to keep the opinions from the public in a sustainable manner.
When they adopt new strategies, we also have to adopt new ways to break their evil thoughts.
In the war that is going on in the form of Vitak Kandan and Kodakantan, the decision should be made for corruption, terrible processes and black money.
On the other hand, there have been letters from many about what kind of bad practices are being dealt with and what kind of new ways are being used.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear countrymen on this occasion.
In order to share such information, the government has created a separate e-mail agency.
Besides, you can also send MYGov on the Internet.
The government has built a shield of war against all kinds of evils that you cit.
When your cooperation doesn't end, it's easy to understand the war.
The third categories of letters are also in large numbers.
"Modi ji, you don't iron, don't hesitate, do whatever serious efforts you want, don't worry about it, but if you decide to travel, you have to step on the path, you have to solve the conclusion and don't have to go back."
My dear countrymen, I had said that even after the voice of Mann Ki Baat last time, our farmer friends have made efforts in such places and have achieved achieving the records that have been produced last year.
This is a good symptom when it looks from the point of view of agriculture.
Be it the worker of this country, be it the farmer or the younger, the efforts of all of them are making the country new.
A few days ago, India has boasted its name in many fields on the World Economic Forum.
India has progressed in the global rankings through different indicators is the result of the continuous efforts of our skilled nations.
India's rank has risen in the World Bank's report on unauthorized trade.
India has risen to 32 places in the World Economic Forum report on World Competitiveness.
We have moved 16 places in the world-class operational index for 2016 and we have moved 19 places in the World Banks Infrastructure Services Index for 2016.
Several other reports point to the same assessment and India is growing at a rapid pace.
My dear countrymen, this time the anger of the people was read on the Parliament meeting.
Angry about the functioning of Parliament has emerged everywhere.
The President and the Vice President openly expressed their dissatisfaction.
But even in such a situation, the heart is happy that some good things are going on.
The country's attention has not been returned to a great work done in the midst of Parliament.
Brothers and sisters, I am happy and proud to say that the efforts of the government have been made keeping in mind the goal of development of Divyangjan and a bill related to it has now been completed.
I express my gratitude to the members of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for fulfilling this and express my gratitude to the millions of disabled persons of the country.
This government is moving towards the welfare of Divyangjans.
Individually, I was also trying to increase the speed of this objective to take forward this objective.
My aim was to provide their rights and dignity to the disabled.
Our divyang brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and hopes by winning four medals in paralympics.
They have not only given the country the pride of their success but have also made the people surprising in the ocean through their talent.
Our disabled brothers and sisters, like other citizens of the country, wealthless wealth and invaluable capabilities.
Employment opportunities have been increased for Divyangjans after the implementation of the Act for the benefit of Divyangjans.
Reservation limit in government jobs has been increased to 4.
Under this Act, special arrangements have been made for education, facilities and grievances of Divyangjans.
In the last two years, 4350 camps have been conducted for Divyangjans and 580,000 disabled brothers and sisters at a cost of Rs.
A new legislation has been framed with the spirit of the United Nations.
Earlier, the persons with disabilities were enrolled at 7 levels, but now by the legislation, we have made it in 21 ways and 14 new conditions are being added.
They have got justice for the first time because of the integration of certain kinds of disabled persons.
For instance, we have linked Talassemia, Parkinson's sufferings and those who have a foolish shape at birth.
The Indian Cricket team has won a 4-fourth bow in the anti-UK test competition.
The lamp of some young men is commendable.
Our country's young Karuna Nair killed 3 percent.
KL Rahul took 199 runs.
Not only did Dest Captain Virat Kohli have a good interview, but also a good leadership.
Spinner of Indian Cricket Top Spinner R.
Ashwin's name was the International Cricket Committee ICC 2016 Cricketer of the Year, and the Best Test Cricketer.
My congratulations to all of them and my best wishes.
In the Hockey sector, there has been a very beautiful and special news after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
This achievement is a pleasant sign of the future of India Hockey.
Our women's heroines have worked well last month.
If the Indian women's hockey team won the Asia Champion Cup, a few days ago, the Indian women's hockey team won the bronze medal in the Asia Cup of 18 years.
Like every year, during Diwali this time, I once again went to the border areas of China to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers.
I celebrated Deepawali at the peaks of the Himalayas with the ITBP, Indian Tibetan border forces and military personnel.
I go every time, but the experience of this Deepawali is irrelevant.
People are not just sending information but also connected to the mind.
Someone took the poems and made films, others produced cartoons, others produced video.
That is, every house is like a place where the soldiers live.
When I saw the letters, I was told how much imagination is there in the minds of the people, how many feelings are there
A soldier of the army had written to me: Prime Minister, all our soldiers, every festival like Deepawali and Holi will be on the borders
We will spend every moment in our thoughts about the security of the country.
Yes, however, there is a feeling of home in the days of festivals.
But if you want to tell the truth, this time there is no such idea.
There is no idea that we are not at home in the day of this festival.
Somehow, with 125 crore Indians, we also felt that we are celebrating Diwali.
My dear countrymen, during this Deepavali festival, the feeling of the soldiers and the security forces of our country should disappear with a few moments
As a society, as a nation, I urge all of you to make this feeling a natural and incorporate in our feelings, whether it is a festival or a festival or a happy occasion, we should remember the soldiers of our country in some way or the other.
When the entire country stands shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, it is certain that the strength and strength of the army will increase by 125 crore.
Some time ago all the leaders of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
These are from the Panchayat Conference of Jammu and Kashmir.
There were about 40-50 leaders from different villages in the Kashmir Valley.
I had an opportunity to interact with them for a considerable time.
They had spoken about some of the development of their villages, some had come with some demands, but it was natural that when the talks began, the situation in the valley, the law and order situation and the future of the children were found in it.
With immense affection and open heart, these leaders of the village have touched their hearts.
During the talks, when I was talking about the burnt schools in Kashmir, I realized that the sorrow that our countrymen were suffering from it and the same was also felt by these villagers.
And they thought that schools were not burned, and the future of the children was burnt.
After you returned to your town, I asked you to pay attention to the future of these children.
I am glad that all these leaders who came from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise made to me very well.
They also cautioned those who went to the villages and were far away.
During the Board exams a few days ago, 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the Board exams.
The participation of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates us that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to take new heights of development through education for a prosperous future.
While conveying my best wishes to those students for their inspiration, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to their parents, relatives, their teachers and all the villagers.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked the people for advice for Mann Ki Baat, the suggestions of all came about one thing.
All of them asked me to speak in detail about 500,000 rupees notes.
In my address to the people of the country on 8th November, I spoke of the launch of a transformational challenge in the country.
Whenever I had made this resolution before you, I had generally said that this decision was not simple, it was complicated.
But the more important the resolution is to implement it.
I am promising to know that innovation in our average life has to be faced by difficulties.
Even then, I had said that this decision was very big and it would be 50 days to get rid of its impact and then we can take steps towards the nature.
For 70 years, the efforts to get rid of the diseases that we have suffered cannot be so easy.
I can understand all the problems that you face.
500 and 1000 rupees notes, such a big country, so many numbers of notes, lakhs of crores of notes, such resolutions - the entire world is looking at itself, every economist is observing it and evaluating it.
India has immense faith in 125 crore people of India and 125 crore people of India are committed to fulfill the goal of their commitment.
All sections of the central government, state governments and regional local organisations, one lakh 30,000 bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than one lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank agents, have participated in this work with dedication and dedication throughout the country.
In the midst of a variety of pressures, all of them were very quiet and were fully involved in it considering the work of the nation as an attempt to make a great change.
As a result, it is clear that India will succeed in this work.
I can see that even in such a situation, everyone works in banks and post offices.
When the matter of human love comes, they are traveling a little more.
Someone told me that an old man had suffered an accident at the place of Khandwa.
Suddenly the money was needed.
I am glad to know that when this thing was taken to the attention of the banker there, he went to the old man's house and collected money and saw no problem in treatment.
Several such innumerable events take place every day in TV, media, newspapers and interactions.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all my colleagues who are working in this Mahavilvi.
But how much the evil has spread, even today, the evil practices have become a habit.
Even now, this corruption money, this black money, this money, and the benami money, have been thinking that they can find some way out and survive.
They have been trying to save their money from the poor by cheering the poor, speaking lucky words or cheering in their accounts, buying something from them.
I would like to tell the people today that the law will see what you should do, whether it is a disappearance or a disappearance or not, whether it is a law or a law or not.
Please do not play with the lives of the poor.
When the name of the poor comes in the records, then during the investigation, my beloved poor should not do anything to the problem because of your sins.
A very harsh law has been made regarding benami properties, which will come into force, there will be a lot of difficulties.
The government wants that the people of our country do not have any kind of problem.
I live in Tirali village of Tirali Taluka in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
You have provided a good song to black money holders and corrupt people through 500 and 1000 rupees notes.
If this step has not been taken then there will never be a good time for every citizen of India.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for this.
Some matters are being encouraged by the media when people get from the government sides.
There is so much joy and pride when you know what a wonderful potential is with the common people of my country.
Even if your words are old, if you want to eat food, do not worry about money, do not go back from here only with hungry, you have to go out with food, you have to pay money if you have to travel on this path.
People go there and eat food and when they travel again after 2-4-6 days, they pay back the money.
This is the power of my country, the spirit of service and the spirit of sacrifice.
During the election, I was interacting with tea and this was spread all over the world.
People from many countries of the world have started talking about tea.
But I didn't know that marriages would take place during the interaction with this tea.
On November 17, a marriage took place in Surat with a discussion on tea.
In Surat in Gujarat, a woman gave only tea to those who came to her house marriage, and did not attend any other festivals, did not produce any awards, nothing because there was a monetary deficit.
It was also a matter of pride.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Taksha Parmar have embarrassed their protest against corruption and black money through their marriage, this is a great conception.
While Navabarinith blesss Bharath and Daksha, I congratulate you all for making the marriage grandeur a great poet and making it a new opportunity.
When such a problem comes, people are making solutions to it very well.
Some people have got immediate benefit from this movement.
The country will benefit in the days to come, but the benefits of some are quickly settled.
When I heard about the happenings, I got some information from small towns.
But this time, because of the 8th resolution, all of them came out to pay their old notes.
Approximately Rs. 3000-3500 crore was collected in 47 City Units during the period last year.
3000-3500 crore, where is 13,000 crore
Whether these municipalities have got four times the money, the setting up of waste water systems for the poor, the setting up of water supply systems, the setting up of Anganwadi centres will be natural
There are many such examples that have seen direct benefits.
Brothers and sisters, Our villages, our farmers, these are the strong pillars of our economy.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, every citizen of the middle of the Left is making himself reform.
But I would like to bow to the farmers of my country today.
Now I was examining the statistics related to the seeds of this season.
Whether it is wheat or pulses or oil crops, I have an account till November 20, seeds have increased in comparison to the corresponding period of last year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmers have found a way.
The government has also taken several important decisions, in which emphasis has been given to the farmers and the villages.
Under the Mudra Yojana, efforts were made to lend them.
Millions of rupees were provided to the poor under the Mudra scheme because crores of people are engaged in such small industries and millions of rupees are providing a boost to business.
Today, whatever I want to tell my small business brothers and sisters, you can enter the digital world by using it as an opportunity.
You also let your mobile phones off the bank's app.
Your contribution can be very big to create a society without cash transactions, you can utilize the entire banking process through mobile phones and today we can do business in many ways without handling the notes.
There are technological ways, which are safe and quick.
I only want you to give your cooperation to achieve this mission and I am confident that you will be able to lead this change yourself and you will be able to give this leadership.
I am confident that you can help the business of the entire village with the help of this technology.
I would like to tell the labourer brothers and sisters that you have suffered more injustice.
One of the wages mentioned in the paper is that the amount given in your hands is different.
You have to get your wages full and no one has to pay for it.
You shouldn't be oppressed.
If money is deposited in your bank account then you can also buy goods in the shops through a small mobile phone, you can pay money through it, you don't need any smart phone, even if your mobile phone is going to be e-walt.
Therefore, my labour brothers and sisters, I would like to make your contribution to this scheme because I have made such a big decision for the poor, for the poor, for the poor, for the workers, for the oppressed, for the victims and for the victims.
Today I want to interact with the youth in particular.
In India, 65 per cent are under 35 years of age, we have been putting Dandora across the world.
I am also aware that you have contributed a lot to take it forward in a positive way.
Friends, You are my real soldiers, you are my true friends.
We all have a wonderful opportunity to serve Mother India. This is a golden opportunity to take the country to the economic peaks.
My young friends, can you help me
You will be aware of the App, which means what is the App, that is, online banking, that is, you will know what is the banking facility through money, that is, the registration of the tickets through money.
These things are simple for you and you are also using them.
But today, the great work that the country wants to do is a society without a dream cash transaction.
It is correct that a society without a hundred percent cash transaction is not possible.
But why shouldn't we start making India a less cash usage society
Once you start using this less cash society, the goal of a non-cash transaction society will not be far away.
I am confident that you will never disappoint me because all of us are in the heart of changing the lives of the poor of Hindustan.
You are aware of how many opportunities have been made today to create a society without cash transactions, introduce digital banking services or introduce mobile banking services.
Every bank provides online facility.
Wald's direct meaning e-purse.
Several types of cards are available.
As per Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have RuPay cards, the lowest utilised RuPay cards have started to be used after 8th date and the walls have increased by 300.
Like the prepaid card on mobile phones, banks also get prepaid cards to spend money.
UPI is a nice platform to do business, so that you can buy goods, send money and get money.
This work is as easy as you send information to the Watts App.
He knows how to send information to the Watts App today and how to forward.
Not only this, technology is very simple as a large smartphone for this work is unnecessary.
Money transactions can also be done through a simple phone.
It can be utilised without any difficulty, whether it is a cheap worker, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller and a seller.
I have stressed the efforts to make this method more easier.
All banks are engaged in it and are doing it.
Now we have abolished the extra fees for online business and we have ended all such taxes related to the card to strengthen the concept of a non-cash society, which you might have seen in the newspapers in the last two-four days.
My young friends, even after all this, it is unsuccessful for a generation.
I am aware that you all are positively involved in this great work.
I look forward to giving you the creative news of whatsApple, tongues, poems, tongues, cartoons, new imagination and laughter.
When I see the creativity of our young people in the midst of the challenges, what do I feel that even in the battlefield the Gita was born at a time is the specialty of this land of India and today when we meet the time of such a big change, I see that a fundamental creation emerges among you.
But my dear young friends, I once again say that I need your help in this work.
Yes, yes, I once again say that I need your help, I am confident that you and millions of youth of this country will do this work.
You will be a part of a non-credited society today.
Leave all the technologies for online expenditure on your mobile phones.
You must lead the society without cash transactions, the jeopardy that emerges from the network of notes, the movement to free the country from corruption, the movement to free the black money, the movement to free the people from the problems of the people.
Once you learn the benefits of the Rupay card for the people, the poor will bless you.
Within a month, we can stand up as a new India. You can do this work through your mobile phone.
Go to 10 houses everyday and join 10 houses everyday.
I invite you, come, your support is not enough, we will be transformed and transformed.
We will move forward in this war that will liberate the country from black money and corruption.
This country has created a great revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge you to take this movement forward.
I invite all of you to participate in this work at the social level and individual level in every school, college, universities, National Students Force and Nation Welfare Scheme.
We will take this task forward.
We all have an opportunity to serve the country for the best. You should not allow this opportunity to bear the golden opportunity.
My dear brothers and sisters, Today is the birth anniversary of a great poet of the country, Harivansh Rai Bachan Ji and today on the birth anniversary of Harivansh Rai Ji, Amitabh Bachchan Ji has given a message of Swachhta Abhiyan.
You might have noticed that Amitabh ji, the most favourable artist of this century, has taken the Swachhta movement forward with a very vibrant vision.
Harivansh Rai ji identified himself through this tax.
I bow down to Harivanshrayiji for my homage.
I express my gratitude to Amitabh ji for joining the voice of Mann Ki Baat and for taking the path of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now through the voice of Mann Ki Baat your thoughts, your emotions, your letters and MyGov and narendramodiapp keeps me in touch with you.
Now Mann Ki Baat (Mann Ki Baat) is being broadcast at 11 o'clock, but in the languages of the state, it will start soon after its completion.
Thank you all.
Deepawali is being celebrated everywhere in India with enthusiasm and joy.
The country of India is taking place in some corner of the country and in some corner of the country for 365 days.
But one thing that can be seen in all these is that the entire journey of the festivals of India, its spread, its depth and its accommodation to the people, is all connected to a fundamental mantra - it is to move towards the society of individuals.
Festivals are responsible for all trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains and birds.
All these days, we are celebrating holidays on Sunday, but you must have noticed that the previous generation, the working class, the fishermen, have pursued their vacation in the days of full moonlight.
Everything has proved to be the kind of change in the sea water during the days of Purnami and the kind of impact on nature.
It also affects the human mind.
That is, the tradition of celebrating vacations in our country as well as the tradition of marching and science.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of Deepawali, as I have said earlier, it is educating and enlightening every festival.
This festival of Deepawali gives us the message that Damasoma Jyotirgama should go from darkness to light.
It does not mean the darkness caused by lack of light.
The darkness of confusion, the darkness of uneducation, the darkness of poverty and the darkness of social evil.
If we are able to get rid of the darkness of Deepawali and the darkness of the individual's deficiency, it is the purpose of spreading light on Diwali.
You will be able to see one thing that we all know well, visit every corner of India, be it the richest house of India or be it the poorest of the poor, when the festival of Deepawali is celebrated, you will be able to see the Swachh Bharat Mission mixed in every family.
There is cleanliness in every corner of the house.
The poor will have soil, but Deepawali has come. He will also keep his soil mixed clean.
The Prime Minister of Canada has shared his film with Deepawali on Twitter.
The UK Prime Minister, on the eve of Diwali in London, organised a welcome event to connect all communities and participated in it.
It can also be said that the UK city does not celebrate Deepawali with big festivals.
The Prime Minister of Singapore shared a film with the world in Instagram with great pride.
Well, do you know what the film is
It is a film that has 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament wearing the Indian fist and stands at the door of the Parliament.
All these were initiated on Diwali.
I would like to say that Deepawali is a bright moon, a big day that inspires all the people of the world from darkness to light.
During the days of Diwali, news of accidents, firecrackers and untimely deaths are alarming.
There is another difficulty - on the occasion of Diwali, doctors also go to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers, and there is another problem with one more problem.
In particular, I appeal to parents and guardians that children should be accompanied by adults when they blew.
The festival of Deepawali is celebrated in our country for a long time.
It's not a day.
Govardham Puja, Pai Duj, Lap Panjami, this is a long time since Karthik Purnami's bright festival, in a way it is a long-standing period.
Together with this, we are also happy to celebrate the festival of Deepawali, we are also engaged in preparations for Sat Pooja.
In the eastern parts of India, the festival of Sat Pooja is a big festival.
In a way, it is a big festival, it is celebrated for four days, but it has a special significance, it gives a great message to the society.
It is difficult to calculate the goddess of the Sun who gives us all and from him we reach all.
This sacrifice, penance and labour of the soldiers and the security forces is emotional in my mind.
I want to share one thing from the world of these feelings - we will dedicate this Diwali to the security forces.
I have called upon the people of the country to participate in a movement called Sandesh2Soldiers, a message to the soldiers.
I would like to bow down to the country's soldiers that nobody is proud of the country's soldiers, nobody is proud of the army and the security forces.
The media has also turned this festival into a day to thank the soldiers.
When we are in the mindset of our celebrations, if we see them thinking about them then a new energy is born to those memories too.
One news also gives manifold energy and the country has done it.
Some portrayed pictures, shouted, and made cartoons.
I can imagine how much pride will be given to the soldiers of my country.
So many things have been identified in the shashtag of Sandesh2soldiers.
I would like to read the poem sent by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan.
Ashwini ji writes: "I celebrate the festival, I am happy, smoke, I am celebrating the festival, I am happy, I am smoking, I am smoking, all these are yours.
I convey my best wishes to the citizens of the country and to you all.
My dear countrymen, a sister Shivani has sent me a telephone informing me that there are soldiers in the birthplace and soldiers in the Buddhist house.
Let's hear what the soldiers want to say.
Salute Prime Minister, I speak Shivani Mohan.
Their families and their wives, along with military officers and soldiers, do a lot of sacrifices.
In a way, even the entire military society has received a very good news.
My dear countrymen, Military braveness is seen not only in the border but in every stage of life.
You might have heard that Himachal Pradesh has been freed from the habit of drinking water in the open.
Vikas Bhatkur, a small village of Sirmaur district of Himachal, belongs to Badana.
The soldiers of our Indian Tibetan Border Force visited their village on holidays.
During the gathering of Panchayats in the village, he went there and there were discussions about the construction of toilets in the village panchayat.
Some families were unable to construct toilets due to cash deficit.
Immediately, he took up his Kacholas Book and gave a cash of Rs. 57,000 to the Panchayat Chairman and gave a toilet of Rs. 57,000 to every family on my behalf, build 57 toilets and keep the village of Badana free from the habit of open defecation.
Vikas Thakur ji has done this thing and has given himself 1000 rupees per year to 57 families and has provided a new energy to the Swachhta Mission.
This is why Himachal Pradesh is freed from the habit of open defecation.
I would like to express my gratitude to the youth for this thing that has happened in Kerala too.
Immediately, the guys of the National Students Force came to the conclusion that they should build toilets in collaboration with all the citizens of the country and engineering students.
All the items required to build toilets like bricks and cements were carried on their shoulders throughout the day and went to the jungle.
They had built toilets in the village through their hard work, these youngsters were freed from the habit of defecating the small villages in the far-flung forest.
This is the reason that Kerala is going to become an unwavering state.
The state of Gujarat has also announced that more than 150 of all municipalities and municipalities have been freed from the habit of open defecation.
10 districts have been declared free from this habit.
But generally these things are not focused on.
The old projects will be implemented and the next project will be expected and this will happen.
There is no need of kerosene in the houses where there is gas layer in our country, the houses where electricity is there.
But whoever is concerned about the government, kerosene is being provided, gas is also being provided, electricity is being provided, in this situation, the middle class has got the opportunity to make money.
Look at such a big change, the market will be stopped, the environment will benefit, the savings of our foreign exchange will also increase the convenience of the people.
Yes, there is no doubt that the middle class and the non-monetary people are suffering.
My countrymen, Gandhiji has always been the guide for us.
In every case, his claim is to determine the status of the country where to go and how to travel.
It is time for us to focus on the aspirations of the poor of the country.
We have to take steps one after the other to get rid of them.
Whatever our ancient thinking, we must liberate the society from the distinction of male and female.
Now there are toilets for women and children in schools.
This is a good time for our women children to achieve the status of an undiscriminated India.
Though immunization is being done on the government side, even then lakhs of children are getting rid of the vaccination, they are targeting diseases.
The Mission Indradhanush vaccine is being conducted for children who are free from immunization, which gives children the power to get rid of dangerous diseases.
We are in the 21st century but there is no longer a darkness in the village but a big movement to bring electricity to the village is progressing successfully.
After so many years of independence, when the poor mother cooked food in her bed, 400 cigarettes smoke in her body, how will her health be
5 crore families are being tried to get rid of smoke and we are traveling on the path of success.
Small traders, small entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, dairy sellers and financing shopkeepers are getting interest loans from other entrepreneurs.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Yojana are the successful movements that have been launched to get rid of interest borrowers.
Direct payment of money to the banks through Aadhaar, directly to the owners and the beneficiaries.
It is a good opportunity to get rid of the standards in the lives of the common man.
We fulfil our hearts with the memories of the dignitaries and do so.
But a telephone call from Punjab, the pain touched my heart, Prime Minister, salute, sir, I speak from Punjab to Jastip.
Sir, on 31st October, the birthday of Sardar Patel ji.
Sardar Patel ji had worked to unite the country throughout his life, he has achieved this goal and has united everyone.
The fortune of the country is not known what it is to say, but on that day, Smt. Indira Gandhi was assassinated.
After that we all know what kind of events have happened in the country.
I would like to know your views on how to prevent such unfortunate events.
My creatures and my countrymen, this pain is not just a human being.
After Chanakya, a Sardar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel have done the work of Bhagirata to integrate the country.
Sardar Patel ji tried to unite, because of his main objective of unity, however, he became a ruler of anger, but the path of integration is no less relaxed from the goal.
However, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars were killed after the assassination of Smt. Indira Gandhi.
On the birth anniversary of that great man who spent his life for integration, the atrocities built on the Sardars are paining all of us on one side of history.
But in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move forward with the mantra of unity.
Unity in diversity is the biggest strength of the country.
While diverse languages, different castes, different clothing and dietary practices, unity in diversity is the specialty of India's strength.
Every generation has an obligation and every government is responsible for looking for an opportunity for unity in every corner of our country and pursuing the principle of unity.
We have also gone away from separatist thoughts and divided natures, and save the country.
Sardar ji has given us a united India, it is our responsibility to make it an excellent India.
The original mantra of unity creates a strong foundation of the great India.
The journey of life of Sardar ji started in the farmers' struggle.
He is the son of a farmer.
Today we are asking the name Amul.
Everything of Amul is well known in India and abroad.
But a lot of people know that because of Sardar ji's vision, milk producer cooperative union was formed.
In those days, the Kera district was called Kera and in 1942 he strengthened this idea and as a result of this, Amul, who was present today, is in front of us as an example of how Sardar ji had worked for the welfare of the farmers.
I convey my homage to Sardar Ji.
On the 31st of October, wherever we are, we will remember Sardar ji and resolve for unity.
My countrymen, Karthika Purnami is celebrated in this Deepawali festival.
Guru Nanak Dev jis foundations are for the entire humanity and it is not only addressed to India but also for the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev Ji is service, pride, pride and good for all.
Peace, unity and harmony are the basic mantras.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji was involved in every aspect of the objective of liberating the society from diversity, consciousness and evil habits.
May your dreams and your commitments be successful in all ways.
In the last few days, we have lost 18 soldiers of our country in the Uri area of Jammu and Kashmir.
My tributes to all the martyrs and brave soldiers.
This cowardly incident has driven the entire country.
The grief in the nerves of the people of the country increases, anger shouts
This loss is not only for the families of those soldiers who lost their children, lost their brothers and lost their husbands.
This loss is being experienced all over the country.
Therefore, the people of the country, I still say that I had said before you that day, the culprits will be punished and they cannot escape the punishment.
My dear countrymen, we have immense faith in our military.
They will defeat every situation by their valour, and 125 crore people of the country will express their valour in a way to live peacefully and peacefully.
We are very proud of our military.
Today, I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir well.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the enemies of the country.
When they begin to understand the truth, they have begun to move away from them and travel on the path of peace.
Every parent wants that schools and colleges should start functioning at a rapid pace.
Over the past few days, business has started well.
We know that peace, unity and harmony can be the solution to our problems, our progress can be the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to take new heights of development.
I am convinced that if we communicate peacefully and pave the way for every problem then we can provide a better way to the future generations of Kashmir.
The responsibility of the security administration of the citizens of Kashmir.
The administration has to take some steps to build law and order.
I also urge the security forces of the country to ensure the peaceful life of the common people of Kashmir and follow them well.
Sometimes those who are different from our ideas present new ideas.
Shershvardhan, a young student of class 11, has made a different idea of my attention.
"After the real terrorist attack, I was more concerned about my mind, there was a distress in my mind to do something, but I did not find the way to do it.
Harsh Vardhan, in this atmosphere full of zeal, in such a young age, you have thought positively. This is my heart's pleasure.
But Harsh Vardhan has a great value of anger in the minds of the people of the country.
This is the expression of the feeling of the people of the country.
Yes, you have introduced a positive approach.
But you know that Lal Bahadur Shastri was leading the country during the war in 1965, the feeling of such a feeling was developed all over the country and the dream of patriotism was patriotic.
There was a commitment to do something in every citizen's mind.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was trying to give these feelings of the country a very high year.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan and inspired the common man to work for the nation.
Every citizen must understand another attempt to express patriotism in the midst of bomb blasts, which they presented to Lal Bahadur Shastri.
While Gandhijis were guiding the freedom struggle, he was successfully inspiring to inspire the creative tasks of the society when there was a need for another platform for the movement when the freedom struggle was intensely dreaming.
We and our army will make our duties, those who are responsible for the administration, our people and every citizen will contribute with this feeling of patriotism, and the country will certainly take new heights.
My dear countrymen, the history of our sportspersons who took part in the Para Olympic Games is the victory of human inspiration.
Varun Vishwanathan ji has registered in the Narendra Modi App that our sportspersons have acted sweetly and asked you to tell this in your Mann Ki Baat.
Not only to both of you, every citizen of the country has a sense of connectivity with the sportspersons who participated in the Para Olympics.
Beyond sports, this Para Olympic Games and the achievements of our sportspersons have completely transformed the perspective of humanity and the perspective of seeing the disabled.
I do not forget the words made by our victorious sister Dipa Malik Ji after winning the medal.
This time, 19 sportspersons, including three women of our country, participated in the Para Olympics.
In comparison to other sports sports persons with disabilities, their talent and their talent in sports are greater than their mindset and determination.
Mariappan Thangavelu ji has won a gold medal in the tall bonds.
They lost their right leg at the age of only five.
Even poverty could not ban his mind.
He is not a resident of a big city, but a middle class family or a rich family.
At the age of 21, he has contributed to medals by supplementing mentality and not suffering.
While they have raised our feelings, we have also changed the perspective of seeing the Disabilities.
Could anybody imagine that the disabled can break the retaliation of the routine Olympics
This time it happened.
Abdul Ladeepparker from Algeria, who has made a gold medal in the Olympic Games for 1500 metres of Running.
Once again I express my heartfelt congratulations to these sportspersons, and in the coming days, India will travel in the direction of making a grand programme for the Para Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a very different experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It mixed me with a very sensitive moment.
The Government of India had organised a Mega Camp for Divyangjans in which many world achievements were made.
I had to meet a little girl who had no eyesight, Gauri Sharadul, her name, a little child from the long jungle area of Nang district.
And she told me some parts of it, and when I told it to be compared to the people's congregation, people were astonished.
I believe that the Government of India has achieved a world achievement in Navsari.
The process of listening to 600 unsuccessful persons with disabilities was carried out within an hour.
It took place in the Kinnas World Achievement Book.
It is a matter of great pride to our country that three world achievements are being achieved by Divyangjans in one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
I must have said that cleanliness should be our natural form, it should be the responsibility of every citizen, it should be seen as a filthy asshole.
Now, on 2nd October, I am sure that there has been awareness about cleanliness in the hearts of 125 crore people of the country.
Similarly, everybody has tried to take one step as we have said that we will take one step towards cleanliness.
That is, 125 crore feet of the country have also been moving towards cleanliness.
If the direction is correct, it is surprising that at least there will be good results.
Be it ordinary citizens, government offices, roads, buses or railway stations, schools or colleges, hospitals, children to elderly, the poor, the farmers and women of the village have made their contribution to cleanliness.
Media friends have also done a positive job.
This progress is not enough, we have to see further progress.
This is very important
So far, about 2 crore 48 lakh toilets have been constructed in rural India so far and about 12 crore toilets have been constructed in the coming years.
In Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, the habit of external defecation will be eliminated very soon.
When I had recently visited Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji in Gujarat, officials had told me that on October 2, the day to end the habit of drinking water in the open.
Come on, people, we see a lot of progress.
Especially my younger brothers are using technology today and I would like to introduce a scheme before them.
The Government of India has organised a telephone telephone in 1969 to know how the level of Swachh Bharat Mission is in your city.
You can take full advantage of this, especially the younger generation, use it well.
The Government of India appeals to the Corporate World to make your contribution forward.
Young professionals who want to work for cleanliness should support the profession.
We can utilize the districts as Swachh Bharat Partners, Swachh Bharat Fellows.
If this Swachh Bharat Mission stands with the governments then progress cannot be achieved and cleanliness cannot be achieved.
Wealth from waste is also important.
Therefore, along with the Swachhta Mission, we have to travel towards the direction of waste to fertilizer.
Fertilizers have been requested to buy compost fertilizers from the waste.
The farmers who want to be involved in organic farming should find the way to get this fertilizer.
These fertilizers should be provided to those who want to improve their land resources, interest in land, to those land which have a substantial impact on chemical fertilizers, even though they need this fertilizer.
Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing to this work as an ambassador to business.
Ministers, Chief Ministers, city mayors and commissioners from all over the country are going to take deeper discussions about cleanliness alone.
What can be achieved by technology
What could be the financial model
Discussions will take place on all these issues.
I have been watching the innovative news about cleanliness.
On that day, I read in the news paper that students of Gujarat Technical University went to 107 villages to create awareness about construction of toilets.
The Government of India has prepared a year-long list in its Ministries.
Each sector should focus on cleaning for 15 days.
The three sectors of the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayati Raj and Department of Rural Development will jointly formulate a Swachhta Project on their respective territories from 1st to 15th October, 2019.
In the last two weeks of October, from 16th to 31st October, 3 more Ministries such as Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs will implement Swachhta Abhiyan on their respective regimes.
I urge the citizens to join if you have some work related to these sectors.
Now you might have noticed that the Swachhta Survey Mission is underway.
Initially, the study was done on how cleanliness was in 73 cities, which was placed before the people of the country.
There are more than 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh, and now in every city and city, we have relied behind and there is a hope of progress for the next time.
There is a competition environment related to cleanliness.
We will have to contribute to this mission of citizens and all of us.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be held.
It has been two years since the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.
I have been asking Gandhi Jayanti to start Diwali and buy some of the doorsteps.
Once again I ask every family to buy some or the other doorstep, when the light burns in the houses of the poor.
On Sunday, October 2, as a citizen, will we not be involved in any work related to cleanliness
I urge you to join yourself in the cleanliness work for 2 hours and 4 hours and share the photograph with me in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share that video.
With our efforts, once again this movement will be strengthened and a new pace will be created across the country.
We recall the Gandhijis and Lal Bahadur Shastris, and reiterate our commitment to do something for the country.
In the past, the responses given by the people of the country to my request to wipe out the gas subsidy are a very inspiring factor in the lives of the country.
This is a mission to collect food items and textiles for the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers landed on the streets and took the old sports items of their families and brought them to Anganwadi, where the poor lives.
Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji, who explained to those political ideas which have been motivated by millions of workers like me.
Today, the centuries of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji, the political thought associated with the roots of India, the tradition of Indian culture, the political philosophy and the human-loving philosophy of that trend, begins.
Sarvajan Hitai, Sarvajan Sukai, the well-being of all, the happiness of all is his contribution.
Gandhiji also spoke of the interests of the people in the market.
How to bring the benefits of development to the poor in the market
Deendayal presented a total economic project in a single word that work for every hand and water in every land.
The country should celebrate his birth centenary as the poorest of the poor.
All the attention of the society and the government should be concentrated on how to bring the benefits of development to the poor.
I recall Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, who was an incomparable source of our thoughts, which was the concept of ours.
The common man of this country has been giving me such inspirations.
What are the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of this country
The record of the common man in my mind and thought has been emerged in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the sky for spreading my ideas and making all efforts to bring it into all languages.
They gave letters after Mann Ki Baat and gave suggestions and betrayed the government doors, highlighted the government's grievances, prepared special programmes with such letters, took representatives from the government side and set up a platform for solutions to problems.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20 minute conversation, it is a new occasion for social change.
What can be more pleasant than this
Therefore, I express my gratitude to all those who have contributed to this success and salute them.
My dear countrymen, next week Navratri, Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi will be coming and arrangements for Diwali will start and there will be a different atmosphere throughout the country.
This is the power of the country and the unity of the society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navratriya or Durga Puja, we think of making this Shakti Puja a path to social unity.
To take the country to new heights, we will follow the pious days of peace, unity and harmony, Navratri and Durga Puja.
We will celebrate Vijayadashmi with victory.
This day is being celebrated throughout the country as National Sports Day.
During the Olympic Games in 1928, 1932 and 1936, he played an important role in winning the Gold Medal for India.
At that time the lamp was only 10 minutes.
Thyan Chand ji put three bulls in those ten minutes and I put the bulls in response to the wound.
My dear countrymen, whenever you come to Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions in MyGov online or narendramodiapp.
They are varied.
This time, however, there were more demands that I should definitely comment on the Rio Olympics.
This is very positive when I see such interest in the public minds of the Rio Olympics, such awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it.
Even beyond the cricket, the people of India are so interested in other sports sports, so much awareness and so much information is known.
Sachin has written that this time you must talk about Sindhu, Sakshi and Dipa Karkar in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
One of these women belongs to North India, one South India, one East India, the other from India.
It seems as if the daughters of India have accepted the responsibility of pride for the country.
On the MyGov website, Shikar Tagore ji wrote that we could have done even better in the Olympic Games.
My best wishes to you for the two medals we have received in Rio, he added.
There is a need to make a long-standing journey in sports events.
Our parents are focusing on lessons today.
They still see sports in the society with the point of view of time.
We have to change this idea.
There is a need to encourage society.
Who else can give this job better than you
Similarly, Shri Satyaprakash Mehra also wrote on the narendramodiap - Mann Ki Baat programme insisting on the need for extra-curricular activities.
In a way, the same feeling was reflected in thousands of people.
It is true that there is no alternative opinion that we cannot act according to our expectations.
We have received only two medals in the medal.
But if you don't get medals, you can see that for the first time in many things, India's sportspersons have shown considerable talent.
Our Abhinav Bindra ji ranked fourth in shooting category and lost medal in a very small difference.
Likewise, Sania Mirza-Rohan Popanna took place in the Tennis Games.
We have worked well in the athletics sector.
After Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar ji was eligible for the track field.
For the first time in the last 36 years, men have succeeded in getting a knock out of the hockeypes.
In boxing, Vikas Krishna Yadav came to the final stage, but he could not get the bronze medal.
Several soldiers, for example, many people like Attiti Ashoka, Datu Pognal and Athanu Das were well performed.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do more.
But if we continue to work as we have done so far, we may have to come back to disappointment.
I have announced the formation of a group.
The Government of India will deeply wash it and consider what kind of activities are there in the world.
Action plan will be implemented on what sector we can work well.
Our plans should be set up with a vision of 2020, 2025 and 2028.
I urge all Indian citizens who are interested to send their suggestions to me on the narendramodiap.
The State Governments will send their suggestions after discussion.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I was able to learn a lot with these small children.
For me, on September 5, it is not just a teacher day, it is also a day of education.
But this time I had to go to the G20 Summit and I felt that today I had to express my feelings in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The more important place for Mother in life is the place of teachers.
We have seen teachers who are more interested in us.
They have dedicated their lives for their disciples and their students.
Today I see Gobichand as an excellent teacher crossing him as a sportsperson.
On the Teachers Day, I salute Pullela Gobisant ji, his penance and his entire commitment to the sports and his joy in the success of the boys.
The contribution of teachers in the lives of all of us is always felt.
On September 5, former President of India, Dr.
Sarvepalli is the birthday of Radhakrishnan
Whatever situation he had in his life, he always tried to live as a teacher.
Not only this, he will never die a student among the good teachers.
In the same month, there will be mentions of books and citations from them.
He might have been observed that I did all the month in his eyes was wrong.
Something even today is like teaching me in the classroom.
Even today, he is giving me a far-flung education in a way.
I am surprised to know how he can write such a pearl in this old age when he sees his signature at the age of 90.
Because my signature is so bad that if someone writes beautifully, then my heart is very honoured.
Your experience will also be like my experience.
If you tell the world what the benefits you have received from your teachers in your life then there will be a change in the perspective that we see teachers.
It is our responsibility to increase the dignity of teachers in society.
If you're taking some photographs with your teachers, if something happens to your teacher, you must share the conception related to your teacher in the narendramodiapp.
It is a valuable thing to see the contribution of the teachers of the country in the eyes of the students.
But when we talk about Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to recall our memories about Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakar.
The tradition that celebrates Ganapati Chaturthi socially is the gift of Lokmanya Thilkar.
He transformed the duration through the Democratic gathering as a day of national awareness and made it a day of social culture.
Democratic Chaturthi was deliberate on all the issues that touched social life, thereby creating a new uprising and a new development in society.
Not only this, his mantra is that Swaraj should be the centre of our reproduction and the power of the freedom struggle should be achieved.
It is not only in Maharashtra but also in the country that today the Ganesh Chaturthi is not being celebrated socially.
They are discussing public matters, conducting articles and competiting for Golam.
The scenes in this will have artistic lighting of things that touch the society.
In a way, a movement to create awareness for all is being carried out through socially democratic class.
Lokmanya Tilkar has given the mantra of Swarajyama our generosity.
But we are now in a free India.
Come on, I'll call you.
Celebrations are the powers of the society.
They give a new life to individuals and society.
Life without festivals is not possible but it has to be changed according to the requirement of time.
I can see that many people have written this time specially about Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja.
They are concerned about the environment.
Mr. Shankar Narayan Prashand and Modi ji have insisted that you should not use the children's statues made of Plaster of Paris through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The idols made by the Plaster of Paris are not favourable to the environment, although others have expressed their concerns.
I urge all of you to use the statues of the children made of mud, the statues of Durga and redeem our ancient tradition.
Ganesh is the one who removes the problems.
In such a situation, we should not create a Ganesh statue that causes trouble.
I don't know how you will take what I say, but I don't just say this, many say it.
One of the artisans of Pune, Shri Abijit Todpale, Kolhapur, Nisark Mitra, Vigyan Prabodhini, Nisark Kata of Vedarpa, Gyan Prabodhini of Pune, Kirgavasa Raza King of Mumbai.
Such various organisations and individuals are making more difficulty in creating idols of dust and campaigning for them.
A Ganesh Chaturthi is also a social service.
Durga Puja has a short time.
Employment will be provided to the families of traditional idols through such mud statues
We will resolve that our ponds will be protected by the soil of rivers and the environment will be protected.
It is natural for all the people of the country to be proud when Mother Teresa, who has served for the poor of India, is now being given a pious grade.
From all the saints, sages, saints, and great men, we have got the privilege of learning something every moment.
We have received something from them, we are learning and understanding good things.
My dear countrymen, Progress Thirst is a movement and how big change it will make
Jan Shakti is seen in the form of a majestic energy.
In the last few days, the Government of India has been making a successful effort with the people to clean the Ganga with the help of five state governments.
We called the leaders of the villages living on the banks of the river Ganga to a meeting in Allahabad on 20th this month.
And among them were men and women.
I convey my best wishes to all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have fulfilled this great work.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chief Ministers of five State Governments who have helped in connecting the people's energy to take an important step in the Ganga's pollution.
My dear countrymen, some things touch my heart sometimes and sometimes there is a special respect in my mind for those who have created an opportunity.
In the Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh on 15th July, about 1.
More than 25 lakh students have written a letter to their parents socially.
Some had mentioned in English, some in Hindi and some in Chhattisgarh that they should have toilets in their homes in a letter to their parents.
They had demanded to set up toilets and some children had written that even if you don't celebrate my birthday this year, there is no paralysis but definitely build toilets.
Children from seven to 17 years of age have done this work.
Mallamma, a 16-year-old woman in Koppal district of Karnataka, has done Satyagraha against her family.
Nothing did he do to achieve anything for himself, to wear good clothes or to eat sweets
The girl child Mallamma's gratitude is to make a toilet in our house.
Look at the importance of the village leader Mohammad Shafi, he organised Rs. 18,000 and built a toilet within a week.
But everybody is associated with it in some way, everybody is making a golden contribution.
I also invite television channels to organize competitions by making such short films.
There is no need for a big studio to produce a film and a big camera.
You can make a film using the camera in your mobile phones during this period.
Our respected President Pranab Mukherjee ji inaugurated a new event called Akashwani Maitri Channel in Kolkata.
Many people can hear the question of the launch of a radio force by the President of the country.
Bangladesh is our neighbour.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are blessed with the same cultural tradition.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Bahadur Radio will be beyond the boundaries, and people speaking Bengali language on both sides will be pleased to hear the sky.
Connecting people with the people, Akashwani's great contribution.
It was inaugurated by the President.
I express my gratitude to the country of Bangladesh associated with us for fulfilling this work.
I congratulate the friends of the sky for their contribution in foreign policy as well.
My dear countrymen, all of you might have made me the Prime Minister of the country, but I am also a man like you.
Therefore, sometimes my mind and some emotional events wet.
Such emotional events give innovative energy and new concepts that inspire the people of the country to achieve something.
A letter that came to me in the past few days had touched my heart.
This was written by a mother about 84 years old.
If the retired teacher had not asked him to not mention his name, I must have mentioned his name.
I also broke the subsidy, and forgot it.
For me, I believe that the letter written by the Prime Minister of India is similar to the Padma Shri Award.
Friends, You must have been aware that I have been trying to write a letter to all those who broke the gas subsidy from my side and some of my representatives will go and give it to those who broke the subsidy.
It is my endeavour to write letters to more than one crore people.
My dear countrymen, we have suffered due to drought last year but this August has caused the pain of continuous floods.
In some parts of the country, there was a flood again.
State governments, central governments, local organisations, social welfare organisations and citizens have made their own efforts.
However, some of the tragic floods have also been remembered.
In August this year, we will recall how the power to live together will be the impact of everybody walking shoulder to shoulder.
In August 2016, the political parties, which appeared in August 2016, together with 90 parties from all over the country and all the political parties in the Parliament, made a law on the Goods Services Tax.
Congratulations for fulfilling this will be to all political parties.
This is an excellent example of what benefits can be achieved if all political parties travel in one direction.
Likewise, all the political parties of the country together discussed the Kashmir issue in one voice over the situation in Kashmir.
Through this, the news was delivered to the world and to the separatist forces and their understanding was expressed to the people of Kashmir.
Interacting with all the political parties about Kashmir, one thing was realized that if I had to suppress it in two words, they were unity and love.
These two words were mixed with their original mantras.
Whatever loss in Kashmir, whether it is the life of a young man or the life of a soldier, the loss of ours is ours, our nation's belief is our belief, the confidence of the 125 crore people, the confidence of the villagers and the Prime Minister of the country.
Those who negotiate small children to create unrest in Kashmir, one day should be answered to this unpleasant boy.
I believe in 125 crore people of the country.
Yesterday morning I had the opportunity to spend a few moments with the youth of Delhi and I hope that in the coming days, the spirit of sports across the country will increase the enthusiasm and zeal of every young man.
We all know that the biggest Kumbh of the world sports is going to be held in the next few days.
The word Rio continues to be repeated in our ears.
Yesterday, in Delhi, the Government of India had made a romantic arrangement for running for Rio Run, playing, living, playing and development.
In the days to come, we will be involved in something or the other to encourage our sportspersons.
I am ready to do this work from your side.
The Prime Minister of the country is ready to bring your best wishes to our sportspersons.
Come, let us all make every sportsperson honourable in the days to come and inspire their efforts and do all that.
Today, when I was talking about the Rio Olympics, I read a poem written by Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a poet from the Central University of Punjab.
Like him, many more poets may have written poems in this regard, some may have made them songs smooth and songs in every language, but today I want to share with you the poem that Suraj ji wrote to me.
Let the medal be slaughtered for India for gold, and for silver and brass.
Suraj ji, I dedicate your feelings to all these sportspersons and I convey my best wishes to you all from my side and to the people of 125 crore people and to fly our flag in Rio with pride.
Mr.
But whenever Abdul Kalam is named, then a future picture of a skilled India in the form of science, technology and missile is shadowed in our eyes
In that way, what kind of efforts have your government been making to realize the dreams of Abdul Kalam
If we want to compose our pace, then research and innovation must be done, this is the life of technology.
If researches and innovations are not created, the way the smell starts in the accumulated water, the technology will become a burden for us.
If we do not do research and innovation, we depend on old technologies, we will become a part of the changing era
Therefore, the government is making several efforts to sow the milkland of science, technology and milk attraction of research in the minds of our young people.
That's why I say let us innovate and aim to create innovation.
This means the Atal Innovation Mission when I call it AIM.
If we want to create the next generation innovators, we should connect our children with this scheme
That's why the Indian government has been designing Atal Tinkering Labs.
10 lakhs will be provided to the schools where such centres are being set up, more than Rs. 10 lakh will be provided for maintenance in five years.
Similarly, the innovation centre is directly linked to innovation.
If we have a powerful and inclusive centre, we get an innovation system to see and consolidate the tests for start-ups.
While it is necessary to set up a new centre, it is also important to strengthen the old centres.
Our eyes face problems in our daily life.
Now we have to find technology solutions.
As Atal Grand Challenges, we have called upon the younger generation of the country to support technology and research, innovate and come together to address the problems faced by your eyes.
The Government of India wants to give special awards to technologically recognized technologies to address our problems.
It is heartening to note that when we talk about the Tinkering Lab, more than 13,000 schools have applied and when we talk about the Centre for Construction, more than 4000 non-educational organisations have come forward to set up such centres.
I am convinced that this is the real tribute to Abdul Kalam, to do research, to create innovation and to find solutions through technology to the problems faced by us in our daily life.
As our younger generation focuses on these, their role in cooking the modern India of the 21st century will be equally important, this will be the real tribute to Abdul Kalam Ji.
My dear countrymen, sometimes ago we were feeling about famine in our minds and now rains are enjoying and news of floods is also coming.
The State Governments and the Central Government are working together with the shoulders to help the flood affected people.
Even though there are some obstacles due to the rains, there is a growth in the minds of every human being because there is rain and agriculture in the centre of all our economic activities.
Sometimes the diseases that cause us to suffer all the lifetime are also afflicted with us.
But if we wake up, if we are in the forefront, then the ways to escape from them are easier.
Take the fever of dengue.
We can protect us from dengue fever.
I appeal to all of you that even though the government, hospitals and doctors do their work, we should not allow dengue in our homes, in our families, in our homes and in our homes and in our homes, we should be aware that there is no water-related disease.
My dear countrymen, I want to turn your attention to another issue.
If life has become so urgent and rapid, then sometimes we cannot even think about us.
You can get relief for a few minutes, but the doctors should stop the habit of taking antibiotics without recommending.
There is another problem: If the doctor recommends to take 15 antibiotic pills in five days, please complete the amount of the doctor's suggestion.
If we leave that there is no need for health, then the microorganisms are beneficial and they are further strengthened.
We call it antibiotic resistance in medical terms, therefore, it is important to follow the methods of adoption of antibiotic and how to be used.
Government is committed to prevent antibiotic resistance
You might have noticed that the antibiotic drugs sold nowadays have been drawn on a red colour above the leaflet, it is only to make you aware that you should pay attention to it.
When we talk about health, I would like to add one more thing to it.
Sometimes the health of pregnant mothers in our country is a matter of great concern.
Every year about 3 crore women in our country are pregnant but some mothers die during childbirth and some infants die during childbirth.
Sometimes both mother and child died.
Though it is true that there has been a decline in the precious deaths of mothers in the last decades, even today, we cannot save the lives of pregnant mothers.
The situation is unaware of the fact that in the pregnancy or the post-blood deficiency, pregnancy related infections and high blood pressure will lead to their lives.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has been implementing a new movement for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Yojana.
My medical brothers and sisters cannot dedicate themselves to the poor for 12 days a year
In the past, many have written a letter to me.
I am sure you will definitely join it.
My dear countrymen, today the concern of climate change, global warming and environment is improving all over the world.
Discussions are going on among the people across the country and around the world.
India has been strengthening this idea for centuries.
In the song, Lord Krishna, Ashvatha: Sarvavrukshanam, that is, I am the tree of peacock.
There is no vegetation that is, there is no vegetation that cannot be treated by Sukrajuda or Nasti.
The example of Sonal, a woman from Pune, attracted my attention.
In Mahabharata's observation, trees also perform the duties of Makkadselva in heaven, Sonal accepts the challenge not only to wish his parents, but to fulfill the aspirations of the entire society.
Khandu Marudi Mahadre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junner Taluka, Pune, Maharashtra
Several people are making such efforts.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, during the month of Bhadra, I have seen a large number of pilgrims coming to the Amba Devi temple there.
Once a social service organisation has provided a wooden tree to those who come to the temple, and if they grow in your village, then mother-in-law continues to give you her blessings.
Millions of pedestrians who had visited this year were given lakhs of trees.
Even temples can start the tradition of planting trees in the rainy season instead of prasad.
This can lead to a mass movement related to tree plantation.
I once again ask my farmer brothers why shouldn't we grow honey tree instead of ruining our land by planting trees on the borders of our crops
Today, we have to import a united tree from abroad for making houses and chairs in India.
The government has created a mass movement and Rajasthan is a desert state.
There too a large number of Van Mahotsavs have been celebrated and a resolution of 25 lakh trees has been taken.
It is not a small thing to plant 25 lakh trees in Rajasthan.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan know what a big challenge it is.
In Andhra Pradesh, it has been decided to increase greenery by 50 by 2029.
Van Mahotsav is also a famous tradition in Gujarat.
In Gujarat this year, projects have been implemented in various ways such as Mamar Forest, Ekda Forest and Shahid Forest, in which crores of tree plants have been planted.
As a foreign visit, multilateral agreements are undertaken in many fields such as a part of the state diplomacy, discussions on trade and defence talks.
But for me, the South African visit is a synonym of a trip in a way.
It is natural to remember the memories of Gandhijis and Nelson Mandela while thinking about South Africa.
When the words of Ahimsa, love and sorrow come in the ears, then the faces of Gandhiji and Mandela will appear before us.
As part of my visit to South Africa, I had to go to the Phoenix colony and the place where Gandhiji lives is known as Sarvodaya.
I had the privilege of visiting Petermaritzburg railway station in which Gandhiji had sown the seeds that made Mohandas a Gandhian train.
This time I had the opportunity to meet many important people who sacrificed their youth for equality and equality.
They fought shoulder to shoulder with Nelson Mandela and spent 20-25 years in jail.
In a way, they sacrificed their entire youth, and I got the greatest privilege of visiting the great men of Nelson Mandela, Ahmad Katha ji, Lalu (EEBA) ji, Siba ji and Germany Besos and Roney Cassres.
When I was interacting with them, when I was listening to their prison experiences, there was no bitterness in their minds and no sympathy.
Sabka Sath Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sabka Sab is a way towards our bright future.
Let us also consider these Indians who have lived the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Recently, I read in a newspaper that a woman who was involved in a fraud and email network lost 11 lakh rupees and committed suicide.
I am sorry about the condition of his family as a woman.
I want to know what your opinion is about such fraudulent e-mails.
A new strategy is spreading throughout the world using technology.
The way technology plays a big role in the economy, its misuse is also increasing.
It was mentioned that if you had received a great reward from the country and you had to pay 2 lakh rupees in the bank account for the redressal of the customs, the person who had suffered from his life without thinking about anything, had sent two lakh rupees in his life and sent a person who was unknowing.
Your borrowing card number and debit card number can be produced and dispatched by anybody whoever wants, through technology, your bank accounts are cleaned.
This is a new kind of fraud, it's a digital fraud.
I believe that we should keep ourselves safe from this confusion, I want to be aware, if such letters come, we should immediately share them with those who know them and friends and help them to create awareness.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to meet many people of the country when Parliament is going on.
I had a pleasant experience during such a meeting.
Some students from Alikar met me and met me.
The enthusiastic enthusiast was running around the girl, they brought a big album, shouting their faces.
They brought films that made Aligarh railway station beautiful.
They built a layer plantation built by plastic bottles at the railway station and created a new shape for the station.
If you have the opportunity to go to Aligarh, you must visit the railway station.
This kind of information about several railway stations in India has come to me now and people from those regions are making their regional artistics on the walls of the railway stations.
You can feel a new feeling.
This is an example of how people can transform through participation.
My congratulations and best wishes to all those who are involved in this kind of work in the country, especially to my friends of Alikanth.
My dear countrymen, with the rainy season, several festivals start in our country.
You will also attend celebrations in your homes and publications.
Raksha Bandhan festival is very important.
Like last year, during the Raksha Bandhan period, cannot you give the country's mothers and sisters the Prime Minister's Life Insurance Scheme or the Jeevan Jyoti Life Insurance Scheme
Brothers and sisters, Give a gift to your sisters in life that really feels safe.
Why should we have put a woman in our homes to cook food or to do household work or to be the daughter of a poor mother.
During this Raksha Bandhan Festival, cannot he be given a prize of Pradhan Mantri Ayurveda Yojana or Jivan Jyoti Ayurveda Yojana
My dear countrymen, many of us would have been born after independence.
We can create such an environment.
Freedom Day is not the event of governments but it should be of the people of the country.
Like Deepawali, we have to celebrate this day as our festival.
Together with the concept of patriotism, I want to do something positive.
You can tell the people of the country that I invite you to clearly address it from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I don't want the comments from the Red Fort to be the Prime Minister.
The ramparts of the Red Fort should be the feelings of 125 crore people.
Several events are planned on holidays.
Awareness is spread in many villages
Someone told me a few days ago that the Hivre Bajar village panchayat of Ahmadnagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers there had sent a feelingful approach to the problem of water.
There may be many villages that want to save water, but after talking to the farmers, they have changed the entire cropping pattern and cultivation system.
They decided that the crop which uses excessive water would be black pepper or banana, such crops would not be cultivated.
Something is easy to hear, but it is not so easy.
But look at my farmer brothers, Immediately they left that black pepper does not take place because more water is required for black pepper.
They did not cultivate fruits and vegetables all over, that is, they only cultivated the lowest amount of water that is required.
They have succeeded in their own efforts to solve the problem of water today through several initiatives such as irrigation, rain water conservation, water recharging or rain water recharge.
Well, I have spoken about a small village Hivre Bazar, but there are many such villages.
I convey my best wishes to the people of such a village and for the good work you have achieved.
Someone told me about the Gorwa GORVA village panchayat in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
When the Indian government brings water to Ladur through trains, I think it is a news for the world.
If there is a good news from somewhere, it is human nature to feel that the entire problem is lost.
This time, I feel like a very happy news has come from the news of the rainy season from 106 percent to 110 percent.
Even though it is still rainy, the news of good rains has also been renewed.
But my dear countrymen, however enjoying that there will be good rains, it also creates opportunities and challenges.
Can't we even start the campaign to save water from the village
The farmers need soil and it helps them in the fields of crops.
Why should we not put the soil in the lakes of the villages in the fields
The soil reservoir of the fields will increase while the water storage of the water levels will increase.
What if you fill stones and soil in empty cement sacks, empty fertilizer bags and shut the water in the way out
I always tell you one thing that whenever we go to Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, we can see various places there, one place of which is worth seeing.
That is, it is important to know how clean the water was constructed at the bottom of the house 200 years ago.
His concern is very natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
Several governments have come up, several schemes have been created, the amount of money has been spent, because of which such a question has been raised in the minds of millions of people in the country as a brother Kumar Krishna.
Those who have faith in time consider Ganga as the provider of housing.
Ganga gives us work and Ganga gives us the power to live.
The way the flow of Ganga is cooked, the economic activity of the country also gets a boost.
A devotee brought us the Ganga, but crores of devotees are required to protect it.
People cannot succeed in working without their participation, so we all should become a chang agent for cleanliness and a transformation app.
We must repeat this thing and remember it again.
Several efforts are being made by the Government.
Efforts are being made to seek full cooperation of all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to unite social and clean organizations.
Several measures have been taken to prevent surface cleaning, hygiene and industrial pollution.
Strict wastes are mixed in large quantities every day through the canals.
In the days to come, projects will be implemented in many more places and the people living along the banks of the Ganges will soon experience the benefits.
I feel that there will be good consequences through this.
I am glad that some officials have told me that the expulsions from the drainage plants in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been successful in ero Liquid Discharge for the past few days.
Black Liquor's expulsion from paper plants is almost complete.
It shows us that we are traveling in the right direction, there has been an increase in awareness.
Not only on the banks of the Ganges, but if someone from the remote southern coast meets, they are sure to ask if the Ganga will not be cleaned.
This is a matter of hope for the masses that will definitely bring success in cleaning the Ganges.
People are giving donations to clean Ganga.
This system is being implemented in a very rough manner.
My dear countrymen, today on 24th April.
On 14th April, we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, and today on 24th April, we are celebrating Panchayat Raj Day.
This is a good thing that is accidentally happening, the admirers who gave us the Constitution of India, the birth anniversary of the Constitution, the biggest connected villages of the Constitution, and the concept of this, the Government of India, in collaboration with the State Governments, implemented the mission of Gramodyam to Bharat Uday for 10 days from April 14 to April 24.
Today, on 24th April, I am going to celebrate Panchayat Raj Day in Jharkhand where our majority tribal brothers and sisters live. This movement has created a big awareness.
How to strengthen democratic institutions at every corner of India at the rural level
How to make villages self-reliant
How can the villages do their own developmental schemes
Various events may have taken place in many villages of India in ten days and it may be less.
I convey my best wishes to all the state governments and rural leaders who have taken advantage of this opportunity for the benefit of the villages and for the development of the villages and for the development of the villages.
There is awareness among the villages, that is the guarantee of the rise of India.
The foundation of Bharat Udaya is in the village rise
Therefore, we all are focusing on the rise of the village and we will reach the desired benefits.
In the education sector, there has been a need for development in the last several years.
Today, if there is a first dream of parents in every family then it is necessary to provide quality education to children.
The idea of houses and vehicles is only after all.
This feeling has improved in the minds of the people of a country like India, this is the great strength.
Therefore, the application for my parents to all is to take a broader and short time to discuss the practices of schools.
If somebody gets up in mind then go to the school and ask the teachers.
This awareness must be the path of reducing the problems of our education system and the contribution of the people.
In our country, all the governments have been focusing on education and every government is making its own efforts.
It is true that a substantial time has come from our people to establish educational institutions, expand educational institutions, set up schools, colleges, faculty inclusion, maximum children to go to school.
In a way, the effort to spread education has become the first and it is also necessary.
But the importance of expansion was more important than that of our educational system.
We have done the greatest work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Our primary objective is to provide good education to all through the Mission of Education.
It is true that we must have a long-standing journey.
But if 125 crore people have decided, then a long journey will be possible.
It is very important that we have to make basic changes according to Sharmila Ji.
Universities of India can be world-class competitive universities.
The importance of education is the same as the skills and the role of technology in education is going to be very important.
I am confident that far-flung education and technology will make our education easier and in some times the results will start to appear in the eyes.
PM ji salutes and I speak from Bijnor to Mona Karnawal.
In today's era, sports is very important for the youth along with education.
It requires a team spirit, a team spirit, a good leader, a natural nature, so that they can grow in full swing.
I am telling this through my experience because I was in the Bharat Saraniar organization, this has a good impact on my life.
It required greater integration.
Their extension gave me a lot of satisfaction and they had a lot of zeal and enthusiasm to do something.
I know that I had once used to play a role in the National Students Force. I know that there is a national perspective that creates a new perspective through these institutions.
I had experienced the benefits of my childhood, I had to fill up a new energy in these institutions and give a new inspiration.
This time I have put some things in front of them.
During this season, I asked why our youth and all the organisations should not be involved in the great work of water conservation.
How many circuits and how many districts can we stop the toilets in the open.
My dear countrymen, today I have to talk about the thing that we all have to think about.
I also see this astonishing thing.
You will be aware of the fact that how much gas cylinders the party will provide was the debate of the last several elections, the political situation of our country was there.
On the other hand, economists were pressurizing the reduction of subsidies, which led to a number of groups setting up, suggestions and decisions on subsidies reduction.
These groups have spent several crores of rupees in the operation.
But today my heart feels very proud of the people of my country.
However, in case of accounts, more than 80 percent of these million people went to the distributors themselves, stood in line, gave them in writing and broke their subsidies.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
If the government gives some tax rebates, then the government will get commendable rains throughout the week in television and newspapers.
Because they are forced to think of political leaders in a new perspective.
Even today, the country's economists have been forced to think in a new perspective.
Even the world's economists presenting a variety of possibilities, this is beyond their thinking.
It must be thought about it at some point.
It is an extraordinary thing that the abandonment of one crore families and the availability of gas cylinders instead of one crore poor families, the balance of one crore households due to the breakdown of subsidies, if it appears to be a simple thing, however, it can be achieved when they believe in the people.
I urge all the political leaders to believe in the people wherever we go and say something.
You will have the benefits you cannot even think.
We have to travel in this direction.
For instance, I thought that why should we conduct an indirect examination for class II and class II and why should we not believe in their examination values
I also feel that there will be no announcement of ticket testers on some railway lines.
If we believe in the people of the country then we can do many such tests.
Once we believe in the people of the country, there will be immense benefits.
This situation has not been created by some political leaders, one crore families of the country have been formed.
A person named Ravi has written a letter to me: Good News Everyday, good damage everyday and tell your officials to tell you about a good thing every day.
The bad news in every newspaper and the media is being reported as breaking news.
Is there no good thing happening in our country with 125 crore people
A few days ago, a newspaper had sent me a letter and told us that we will not even issue a bad news on Monday and release a positive news.
The fact is that there is an atmosphere of positive news.
Everyone feels that good news and real news should be available to all.
Whatever a well-known person gives special information, however beautiful it is, however beautiful it is, even if he explains it in a beautiful way, the best benefit is received by a good news.
Good news is a concept of good things.
The truth is that the way we strengthen the benefit, the place for evil is reduced to the same.
If we take the fire, then the darkness shall depart from itself, and surely it shall depart.
You can also contribute to it.
Rabi ji, you have given good advice but please don't worry about me.
Together with us, we will be involved in constructive efforts, we will be able to talk about positive things and we will participate in the efforts to bring about positive things.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
The Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourism.
Many people of the world are unaware of the fact that millions of people have come on the banks of the river for several days.
The festival concludes with peaceful mind and peaceful environment.
These events are achieving greater standards in the form of organisational, programme management, as a peoples participation.
For the last two days, I have been looking forward to many films related to Simhastha Kumbh.
I would like the tourism department of the Government of India and the tourism departments of the State Governments to hold a photography competition in this regard.
You can ask the people to welcome the best pictures.
This can definitely be done.
When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh met me in the middle, he told me that special attention has been given to cleanliness.
Cleanliness is not only during this festival, but also aims to embrace the concept of cleanliness from there.
While I accept a festival related to spirituality during the Kumbh Mela, I believe that it can also become a social opportunity.
We can use the Kumbh Mela to enhance our love for water, how we can respect water and the news of water accumulation.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
I see you speaking to me, but I want to dedicate your thoughts and expressions to you in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
You might remember that last time I had spoken about a book with the stories of Bremchand Ji and whoever has to read it, share your thoughts through the Narendra Modi App.
A large number of people have presented their views on books written on various fields of science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and lifestyle.
Some people are asking me to talk about many other books.
I will definitely talk about some other books.
But now I have to acknowledge that I do not have enough time to read more books.
But I feel that we should take forward the experience we have received in the last one month.
Friends, It is true that I had touched the voice of Mann Ki Baat about water conservation. But even before this, I feel like a matter of water conservation that touches your hearts is the most favorite thing for the common man.
For a few days, it is a matter of water that has driven the entire country.
Several important efforts are being made to impact water conservation across the country.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
The media has also undertaken several innovative movements related to water conservation.
I am happy to learn that Meghalaya, the most beautiful state of the North-East, has created a water policy for itself and a water policy.
I convey my best wishes to the state government.
In Haryana, low water harvesting is being encouraged to cultivate crops that are not affected by farmers.
Why should we not use these festivals for water conservation
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm
And especially the achievements of the children and their achievements give us enthusiasm and new energy.
The things that I say now can bring you together pride and enthusiasm.
We all know how tremors can be made in the world, a word of cancer.
While standing in the gates of death, these ten children have not only rushed towards cancer in their struggle of life, but have also been praising the name of the country for their wonderful activity.
This month, the World Children's Winners Games World Child Winners Competition was held in Moscow.
In this case, there were competitions such as shooting, swimming, drive, telephone and table tennis.
These ten winners of our country have won medals in this medal and some of them won more than one medal.
My dear countrymen, I am sure that the victory that India has achieved in space across the Chandrayaan-2 will give you pride and pride.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, B.
Many such as Arvind Rao have been asking the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country to talk about this Chandrayaan 2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In terms of space, India has to say the best year for 2019.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March, followed by Chandrayaan 2.
We were unable to talk too much about the greatest importance of A-Sat in the election campaign.
But the A-Sat missile is 300 km above the earth in just three minutes.
On July 22, the entire country was proud to see Bong Chandrayaan flying on the 2nd of Mann Ki Baat.
Chandrayaan 2- This goal is special in different dimensions.
Chandrayaan 2 will help in furthering our understanding of the moon.
Even in our life, we will have to face temporary recessions
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I will present the information about a very interesting competition for the country's student wealth and younger communities and invite our youth to participate in this issue.
The knowledge of space, Indias space programme and scientific technologies will be the components of this issue.
For example, what is the need to do in the launch of the rocket, how the satellite is set on the rocket, what information we get from the satellite, what is the A-Sat or what will happen in this competition.
On the MyGov website, on the first day of August, the competition will be reported.
I invite my young friends and students...
I appeal to all schools, parents and enthusiastic teachers to work hard to achieve your school.
I inspire all the students to join them.
The most interesting thing is that the Government of India will take the maximum number of students in every state to Sriharikota at its own cost.
In the month of September, they will also get the opportunity to see the lunar sight of the Chandrayaan land.
Our Mann Ki Baat has inspired the cleanliness movement at times
Similarly, the efforts being made for cleanliness are also inspiring the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the journey that started five years ago has established new scales of cleanliness with the help of everyones participation.
I do not say that we have achieved the ideal of cleanliness but the success of the Swachhta movement to the public is the strength of the commitment of 130 crore people from the habit of drinking water in the open.
But we're not going to stop with this.
This movement is now moving from dirty conditions to beauty.
Just a few days ago, I had to know about Yogesh Cheney and his group through the media.
Yogesh Cheney is an engineer and has returned to the country to serve Mother India by breaking down his work in the United States.
Some time ago, he made a challenge not only to make Delhi clean but also to beautyful.
He joined his team and started his work from the dustbins in Lodhi Garden.
You might remember how the streets of Prayag Raj were mixed in paintings on the Kumbh.
I also knew that Yogesh Cheney ji and his team had shown their hands there.
We also feel it experienced in the beauty of the Swachhta Mission.
The principle of waste to wealth should be strengthened in our society and it should be our culture.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I had to read an interesting idea in MyGov.
This was registered by Mohammad Aslam, who lives in the Shobian area of Jammu and Kashmir.
I like Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to note that I have contributed positively to the Gram Renaissance Programme in my state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The programme was organized in June.
Mohammad said that I think this is the first action plan to direct people to the government.
Many more things have been added to it to make this project more interesting.
Under the Khelo India scheme, sports competitions were organized for children.
He was awarded sports equipment, workshops for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment, Scheduled Castes and Tribal Certificates.
In a way, this event, the festival of development, the festival of public participation, the festival of public awareness.
A large number of people participated in this development festival of Kashmir.
While it would be a matter of happiness that the programme for the return of the village was done in the inner villages, the government officials climbed on the difficult hilly paths to reach such remote villages and travelled for two and a half days.
The officers also visited the border villages of the Sadasurav period and beyond the borders and travelled without any fear to the most disturbed areas of Shobian, Pulwama, Gulkhanav and Anantnag districts.
The welcome given to them has affected many officials and they have spent time in these villages even more than two days.
It is a pleasant thing to organize the Gram Sabha meetings in these areas, to ensure a large number of peoples participation and to formulate their own schemes.
New commitment, new zeal and wonderful results.
It also clarifies whether anybody wants to sow barriers and barriers in the development journey and whether the measurements produced by their atrocities will ever be successful.
My lot of countrymen, do you know how Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre has written in a poem of Gyanpeeth Awards about Marikal
People from different cultures and languages across the country have been happy to celebrate the month of their own.
If we have seen us in this season, then the earth shall appear as if some cow wards on him.
There is a new energy in all directions.
During this holy month, many devotees take a watch, take a pilgrimage to Amarnath, many are fasting and are eagerly awaiting for festivals like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this period, Raksha Bandhan festival is also coming out of the love of brothers and sisters.
You will be happy to know that this time more than four years devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh devotees have visited the auspicious Amarnath cave.
More than the number of people who participated in this 60-day pilgrimage in 2015, this time the number has been discontinued in just 28 days.
I would like to extend my special congratulations to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality after the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
All those who have returned after the journey are attracted by the hospitality and admiration of the people of the state.
All these will be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
Even in Uttarakhand this year, Sardham has started a pilgrimage, in which more than 8 lakh devotees have come to Kedarnath temple in just one and a half months.
For the first time since the terrible natural calamity in 2013, people have made a pilgrimage to such an achievement.
I urge you to visit beauty places in the rainy season and visit them anywhere in the country.
Nobody else can see such a beautiful place of our country, feelings of the people of our country, feelings of tourism and pilgrimage.
May this beautiful and vibrant month of Maritime bring new energy, new expectations and new aspirations to all of you.
Similarly, in August, the memories of the uit India Movement are being retained.
On the other hand, there is heavy rain in different parts of the country and in many areas the people of the country are suffering from floods.
When we see the rains on television, we can see only one point of view - wherever we see floods, floods, water and transport stops.
After a month's wait, I will come again.
Today, people from all over the world of Christian community will be celebrating the eastern day.
Today, when India is playing with Australia, I convey my best wishes to both the soldiers.
India won the Gold in 1951 and 1962 Asian Games and India won the fourth position in the 1956 Olympics.
Unfortunately, in the last few decades, we have been pushing down the ranking.
Today, if our position has declined in the FIFA rankings, it is also difficult to quit it.
Be it the EPL or the Spanish League or the Indian Super League, I see that today the interest of Indian youth is increasing in footwear.
The youngsters of India are watching televisions to know more about footpath.
At the same time, we can utilize this opportunity and take the footprint to every village and every street.
The FIFA Under-17 World Cup of 2017 is such an opportunity that in this year, we should try to create a new zeal and innovation of footwear among the youth.
I believe this is an opportunity to brand India globally.
You must have planned that my dear student wealth can go to tourism on holidays.
Very few people travel abroad, most of them travel to every state for 5 days and 7 days.
Some people leave their states and go to other states.
There is a doubt whether I am not going to be a district in India.
Tourism has a great strength in creating our lives. Nowadays Indian youth are showing great interest in tourism and their enthusiasm is increasing.
They don't travel in the old way, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
I think it's a good sign.
There is also a case in our area that if you blacken your hands with coal, others will automatically flee.
But it is a pleasure to set up a tourism cycle with the same coal.
This is just the beginning, so far more than ten thousand people have experienced a coconut mine tourism in the atmosphere near Sawaneer village near Nagpuri.
It provides an opportunity to see innovation.
Can you contribute towards cleanliness when you visit other places during this holiday
This may not be done scientificly, but it is true.
Could you also work as a tourist to strengthen the concept of Swachhta at the Centre of Tourism
The tourism in India is far behind in comparison to the world.
But if 125 crore people decide to strengthen our tourism sector with one mind then we can attract the world itself.
Come on, we will be in an effort to travel in this direction.
My young friends, I don't like some holiday days or the other.
Think in this perspective.
Would your holidays, the glorious years of life, and the significance of these vacancies go to waste
I'll put an idea to your child.
Can you develop a capabilities during your vacations and cannot connect a new thing to pride your personality
If you don't know the swimming, I will learn swimming during the holidays or if you don't know how to drive a bicycle.
Even today, if I'm typing the computer with two fingers, can I do the leaflet training
How many capabilities are there to develop our personality or not
Why can't we learn them
Why shouldn't we remove our grievances
Why shouldn't we develop our energy
Now imagine that there is no need for big training for this, no trainee is required, no cost is required or big cost.
Similarly, there will be discussions with other friends.
I am confident that you will definitely do this and tell me what you have learnt newly.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi.
Salute Prime Minister, during the last summer holidays, you had said that the warmth of birds and birds should be so that we should keep water in a balcony or in the bed of the house so that they can get water.
I was very happy to do this thing, through which my friend blossomed with many birds.
I once again urge you to express this thing in your voice of Mann Ki Baat.
He has telephonely reminded me of a good thing.
I was asking you to fill water in soil vessels outside your house in the summer.
Abi told me that he has been doing this work throughout the year, so that many birds have loved him.
Mahadevi Varma, one of the greatest poets in the world of Hindi literature, had a immense fate on birds.
He said in his poems, I will not let you go away, I will fill the whole with grains, and I will fill the cool breeze with water everywhere.
The Kooke of Mysore has a very minute idea.
Have we ever given them water
Shilpa, my heartfelt gratitude to you, you have put forward a very emotional idea in a very natural way.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard more about Digital India.
Some people can see this Digital India as a matter of youth in some town.
If you distribute the App for these farmers' convenience in your mobile phones then all the information related to agriculture and weather will be available in your handloom.
Several information can be obtained from what is the situation in the markets, what is the situation in the markets, what is the trend of good harvesting, what kind of pesticides will be suitable.
If you ask any questions to them, they answer it or understand you.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to send the App to these farmers in their mobile phones.
We have taken an effort to create assets for water conservation through Manreka.
There may be many villages that have created such awareness in the country, many leading farmers and many aware citizens.
I welcome this.
In 2014, there were about 612 crore diabetes patients in India.
Statistics show that 3 percent of the deaths occur due to diabetes.
Diabetes is of two types, one type one and another type 2.
Type-1 is a traditional tradition, herditory and mother-father.
Type 2, because of habits, because of age, due to obesity.
As the world is concerned about diabetes, it has been set up as the centre of World Health Day on 7th.
Our lifestyle is a big reason for this.
Physical work is decreasing.
Could we take the pregnancy from 7th April in our lives as a result of diabetes defeat
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we don't get a medical check up done by putting a problem.
Only after the situation deteriorated, you know that there has been diabetes for a long time.
Our country is less than the number of tuberculosis patients in other countries.
This disease can be accomplished by proper treatment .
India should be freed from the grip of these diseases.
But without your cooperation, only governments, doctors and medicines cannot eradicate them.
Therefore, I urge the people of the country to fight diabetes and eradicate tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, several important events will be held in April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar ji.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
On April 14 this year, I got the privilege to visit the birthplace of Baba Saheb Ambedkar Ji.
Baba Saheb Ji has given us everything that is required to be a great citizen.
He travelled through his path and lived as a good citizen, we can pay a special tribute to him.
In the next few days, Vikram Year will start.
New Year is being celebrated in various states in different forms.
My best wishes to all for the New Year.
I had also told you this last time that whenever you want to hear the voice of Mann Ki Baat, you know that you can hear it in about 20 languages.
You can ask them at the time of your privilege.
You can hear it in your mobile phone.
I am happy to join you.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the eastern festival.
My young friends, all of you will be on one side of the election.
An excellent inspiration is emerging.
You may be aware that India is going to hold the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in our country next year in 2017.
What do I say is to insist that the interest in footprint increases, but if such a great opportunity is being supplied by the doors of India, will we make our duties from men alone
I had made an appeal to you even last time that wherever you are going, welcome the photograph of that place.
Millions of people of the country have done the work done by the tourism sector, the work that our culture cannot be done by the state governments and the government of India.
The joy is really enjoying when they see all their photographs.
We have to take this task forward, do it in the same way, but add this process to another one.
Not only sending photographs, but also show your creativity and visiting new places, many things can be learned.
India is a diverse country.
If you start traveling to see once, you will be traveling throughout your life and you will be enjoying.
Normally we want to be away from coal mines.
When we see the films about the members, we think what is going to be there
I am confident that my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
Be it government, organisations, society, citizens, all of us will join this work together.
Your personality will be identified by it and your self-confidence will increase a lot.
They are coming to sell milk near our homes, newspaper sellers are coming and postmans are coming and sometimes the sellers of clothing and the sellers are passing through.
Have we ever heard that you should stop their thirst when the heat of summer remains
Only then can one drop of rainwater be used without waste.
The beginning of farming for the farmers is very important.
But the people of the country should also think of what happens if there is no water.
This time you might have noticed that 5 lakh lakes have been trying to construct irrigation ponds.
I still remember that people are scared as soon as they ask the name of TB at my young age.
If tuberculosis is to be freed then proper treatment is important and complete treatment is important.
If half of the treatment is left in the middle then the disease will come back.
Give me a miss foot, whenever you have time, you can ask the old Mann Ki Baat programmes and ask in your language.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
In a way, this is my entire Mann Ki Baat event in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat event will be held in 2016.
If we see in a way, we can say that every festival leaves the hope of when the next festival will come.
Sometimes India can also be said to be an economies driven by festivals.
These are the reasons for the economic activity of the lower sections of the society.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all the people of the country for the Christmas festival and convey my best wishes for the coming 2016.
May 2016 bring you all a lot of joy and happiness, let me take you all to new heights of enthusiasm, new energy and new commitment.
Whether it is extremism, the world becomes warm, the natural calamities, the calamities created by man.
What else can be the greater joy of living a peaceful life in the humanity by getting rid of all these things
Chawle Chawker ji is a tourist season, a large number of domestic and foreign tourists, people go to many places for Christmas celebrations.
I welcome Ganesh ji's views as much as our tourist destinations are clean and the spirit and feeling of India is less in the minds of others.
I am taking the ideas of Ganesh in the middle of the people.
When we are in the tradition of Atiti Deva Bhava, that is, when guests come to our houses to see the guests as a god, do we engage in washing the house immediately or cleaning the house
Similarly, we should keep our country's tourist destinations, centres and tourist destinations clean and clean, we need to strengthen it.
I am glad that there are colors of news from all over the country about cleanliness.
Earlier on the very beginning, I had conveyed my congratulations to the media friends for this matter.
Because they are digging small and good things and bringing people to the sight.
I would like to share this thing with you now that I had read the message that he had built hundred toilets in Bhojpura village only with his labour.
The country is progressing at a rapid pace due to irregular efforts of many.
125 crore people of the country are moving towards the path of progress and the country is also progressing.
Excellent education, improved skills, growing job opportunities
Life insurance schemes for citizens, banking facilities, global trade without seats, setting up of new entrepreneurs.
All the simple families who cannot reach near the banks are now able to get loans easily through Mudra Yojana.
Nowadays, Indians have begun to understand that the world has started playing the milk of Yoga.
When we celebrate International Day of Yoga all over the world, we all felt the feeling of how proud country our country is or not
This feeling will come to us only when our thoughts and thoughts are large.
And when his mother opens the mouth of Jesus, the eye of butter, and the mouth of his mother, and he opens, and who can forget that she saw the eggs there
Similarly, Yoga Day has made us feel the significance of India as Indians.
Nowadays talk about cleanliness is echoing every household.
Be it a farmer or be it a farmer or be it a young man or be it a mother-in-law or be it a change in their lives, this is also a big thing that the government officials working in bringing electricity to those villages will be enriched.
Can't I alone do everything
But when I talk about it, shouldn't I give my contribution
Even an ordinary citizen can join me by launching an App called Narendra Modi in his mobile phone.
I am sharing simple things in this.
I am glad that even the people share a lot of things with me.
Come, let us join us in matters of the interests of the common man, bring us together to the common man, and give them imagination to obtain their rightful things.
My dear young friends, on 15th August, I had presented a fundamental concept of Start-up India, Stand-up India from the Red Fort.
After that, all the sectors of the government were taken into consideration.
Can India be the capital of Start Up
Start-up India, Stand-up India, has added a great opportunity to the younger community.
My dear young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will start the start-up India, stand-up India.
We have a stable concept of start-ups that the digital world is the only one in the IT sector.
Keeping in mind the needs of India, we have to make changes.
The knowledge skills of our younger generation are spread all over the country.
This start-up India, stand-up India should not be left in some cities, it should not be spread across the corner of India.
Therefore, I appeal to all the State Governments to take this scheme forward.
On January 16, I will definitely share with you in detail in this regard.
I look forward to your best ideas.
My dear young friends, on 12th January Swami Vivekananda's birthday.
Like me, there are crores of people in this country.
From 1995 to 12 January, we are celebrating Swami Vivekananda Jayanti on National Youth Day.
The festivals will be held in Raipur, Chhattisgarh from 12th January to 16th January this year.
I specially ask my young friends to send your views directly to me through my Narendra Modi App.
I want to know and understand what is in your mind.
Dilip Chauhan from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, is a disabled person with vision and observed the Accessible India Day in his school.
Thank you, Dilip ji.
Sometimes when we meet people like them in our lives, there will be concentration in our minds.
The perspective of such people will be emerged on the basis of our thoughts.
There is no doubt that I have a significance in words.
This year when the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Yojana, I was organised to participate in it.
But in some districts of Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai, I had to go there because of the severe floods, I could not participate in this event.
Though I couldn't participate in this event, I had thoughts about it in my mind.
Innovations need to be simplified to simplify schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, accessible vehicles, lifts and braille-linguistics.
They should not die in the cups.
Even the schemes were not made for the common man and the poor
Efforts were made a few days ago about how to facilitate the beneficiaries of the scheme.
The subsidy for gas cylinders is being provided in our country.
Crores of rupees are spent for this, but no account has been filed for this.
The government has made a slight change in the subsidies to know whether the subsidy reaches the real beneficiaries or not at the right time.
By the end of November, approximately 15 crore people are beneficiaries of the Bahal Gas scheme.
These 15 crore beneficiaries have directly access to bank accounts.
This happens without intermediaries, recommendations and corruption.
On the one hand, the Aadhar Identity Card Mission, on the other hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, the Central State Governments are preparing the list of beneficiaries and connecting them with Aadhaar Identity Card and Bank Account.
There was a colour of accusations related to the scheme.
In many places, money is being directly deposited in the bank accounts of working workers.
So far, up to Rs. 40,000 crore has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries regarding 35,40 schemes.
My dear countrymen, a golden moment for the Republic of India on 26th January.
This day is a very pleasant link to Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji's 125th birth anniversary.
We have to take it forward.
Only during the elections, there is a lot of advertising that it is a sacred obligation, it will be written on the walls and layers.
In the elections, we will talk too much about duties, but why shouldn't we talk about the same duties in daily life
This year, when we celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, cannot we organise a poetry and talk competition in schools, colleges, villages and towns, in different societies and associations, for one reason on January 26
When 125 crore people take one after another with the feeling of obligation then see how great a history will be created and how big a history will be created.
On January 26, when we celebrate the Presidents Day, cannot we clean and decorate the idols of the heads of the country and the surrounding places by the citizens through school-children students
As a citizen, I have the idea of doing this.
We are very emotional in maintaining the statues of the leaders whom we are very emotional in maintaining the statues.
Can't we continue to clean up as a society and as a nation
On January 26, we will join this effort together.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much.
On the other hand, the Christmas festival will be started.
There is a separate place for festivals in social life.
Sometimes festivals are also beneficial to causing wounds and sometimes they give new inspiration.
But sometimes when there is trouble in the days of the festivals, they cause great pain.
From every corner of the world, there is a continuation of natural calamities.
Till now, there are reports of disaster events without questioning.
We are now realizing how fast the impact of climate change is spreading.
State Governments are engaged in rescue and rescue operations in full swelling.
The central government has always been working shoulder to shoulder.
I am sure that even after all these difficulties, Tamil Nadu will again speed up the path of progress and contribute to the progress of the country.
But there is a feeling of a change in the face of such a terrible environment around us.
Until about 15 years ago, natural calamity was related to the agriculture sector because it was natural calamity that was only dry and famine.
Governments, peoples society, citizens and small organisations have to work in the field of scientific development.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I had interacted with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ji.
I suggested that we as South Asian countries should work together to take a joint action to combat disasters.
I am happy to note that a conclave in this regard and a conclave on the best ways to deal with disasters has also been held in New Delhi.
It's a good beginning.
I am speaking to Lakwinder Singh from Jalandhar in Punjab.
We are working here in the field of natural farming and others are also guiding farming.
One of the reasons for this is that you are cultivating the natural way
It is also a matter of great pleasure that you are not only doing this but also understanding the problems of the farmers.
Your concern is justified but this is not just happening in the states of Punjab and Haryana.
This has been our routine throughout India, and traditionally we are burning the agricultural waste after the crops.
Earlier, we did not know about the evil caused by this kind of burning. Everybody was doing it so I am doing it too.
Because of this, it has continued to grow and it has been associated with climate change today.
After the impact of this distress began to reach the cities, protests of the people started shouting.
That's the real concern you've expressed.
In the first phase, our farmer friends should be trained and explained the truth to them.
This can save time by burning agricultural wastes after the crops, reduce the difficulty and make the land ready for the next stage.
But this is not the right regulation.
After the harvesting, agricultural wastes are also very valuable.
They are natural fertilizers.
We're wasting them.
Not only this, if we make them small pieces, they can be guests for animals.
Secondly, when we burn them, the upper layer of the ground becomes burnt.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, think about a moment, our bones are firm, our heart works well, our kidney works very well, everything is fine, but if the skin on the body burns, can we live
As the skin of our body burns, we cannot survive, as we burn the skin of the earth, the skin of the mother of the earth burns, and the layer of our land burns.
Therefore, we have to take positive steps in this direction.
I got an opportunity to interact with the farmers who are engaged in bananas.
They shared their best experiences with me.
They had to spend 5000, 10,000 and 15,000 rupees per hectare to eradicate their lives.
There was no work on them until they came to the tractors.
Last time, I had spoken about organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
I mentioned the NOTO Free Phone Number in this regard.
Various fame like film actress Ravina Dundon joined them.
Organ donation can save many lives.
What else can be greater than this
The National Registration Centre for Organ Transformation of Organ Transformation was launched on 27th November.
I am confident that awareness will spread in this field and I am confident that the needy will definitely get timely help.
Because, till there is no one to donate, this help will not be available in any way.
I had earlier said that on December 3, we are following the Disabilities Day.
Physically, individuals with disabilities are unmatched courage and unparalleled skills.
Sometimes when they are portrayed as calciums, heart feels painful.
Sometimes they are expressed with compassion and compassion.
But if we change our perspective, if we correct the vision of seeing them, they will be a concept of ourselves, they will be an inspiration for us to understand the achievements.
Their commitment, their share of life, their ability to turn the problems into positives, thirst and appreciation.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmad Ji, 40-42 years old.
In 1996, militants shot Jawad Ahmed in Kashmir.
But Javed did not accept Ahmed's defeat.
Terrorism wounds did not despise him.
There was no part in his motivation: a person who had not committed any crime was punished, his young man was wasted, yet there was no anger or anger in his mind.
He had dedicated himself to the education of children for the last 20 years.
As a social servant, as a aware citizen, he is the sovereign of the disabled, today he is making a peaceful revolution.
Isn't Javed's life enough for all Indians
I would like to commemorate the life of Javed ji, his fervour and his dedication on 3rd December.
Despite the deficiency of time, I have been able to talk about Javed Ji today, even though all the corners of India are illuminating and encouraging them to live and drive the way.
Thus, on December 3, we have to be inspired by them.
In many cases, we have to work on governments.
The middle class, the middle class, the underprivileged, the underprivileged, the victims, the underprivileged, the oppressed and the oppressed are all associated with government and government-related organizations.
As an ordinary citizen, they have somehow got a bad experience with government employees.
These couples are spending their wealth in the development of the poor in their retirement life.
The total population of the smallest village of Balasore district of Odisha is from the tribals.
The poorest village is a state of malaria.
Jamuna Mani Singh, an ASHA servant from this village, decided that I will ensure that no one from this village will die due to malaria.
He ended the struggle against Malaria and prepared the entire village to face it.
Any such moments may be in the country.
You should not only study but also recommend others.
The creative power is the greatest power.
Sharing good things related to this, sharing these e-books and discuss it.
My dear countrymen, the world is deeply concerned about climate change.
National Energy Conservation Day on 14th December.
Several schemes are being implemented by the Government.
The LED Bulb Mission is moving forward.
On the night of full moon, I had once told you to drain the street lights and wet the full moon for an hour.
I had the opportunity to see that a friend had sent a link to me.
I felt that I should share it with you.
He is trying to give light to the poor by using solar energy, fighting with darkness, working with his name and setting up a group of women.
Lander, a solar powered lamp, has been inaugurated.
He is providing these lander lights at a cost of Rs. 100 per month.
People buy these lights in the evening and give them lightning in the morning.
Until I heard, I know that about 500 households are giving this kind of electrification.
This Noorjahan is working in providing lightning to these londers throughout the day.
But a good beginning has been started.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42,000 crore through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy that out of these 66 lakh beneficiaries, 24 lakh women are women.
I had already said that Swachh Bharat will create such entrepreneurs.
Sailesh Bhonsley has finished this.
He is buying a tanker and I know that he has paid a loan of Rs. 2 lakh to the bank in a short span of time.
This is our goal of Mudra scheme.
This was similarly mentioned about the Mamda Sharma ji of Bhopal.
He also received Rs. 40,000 from the bank under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He is working on manufacturing a cup.
Due to lack of interest, about 1000 rupees per month remains.
His family also had a good business.
But I want to make this scheme more popular and expand.
All our banks have to reach this with greater understanding and come forward to help small businessmen in large quantities.
In fact, they are the economic missionaries of the country.
These are the economic forces of the country.
We want to inspire them.
Good thing has happened, but it must be done more and more well.
This means that Rashtrayam Jagrayam Vayam, Eternal Vigilance is the piece of freedom, that is, permanent awakening is the price for our freedom.
The name of unity of the country must continue to be shouted.
But I expect more suggestions.
I am confident that your above suggestions will certainly be beneficial.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is going to start.
Once again my best wishes to my dear countrymen, Jai Hind
Then I have got the opportunity to interact with you all through Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth day cricket competition between India and South Africa is being played in Mumbai.
This 5-day cricket chain is known as Gandhi Mandela chain.
Therefore, the interest in the final competition has increased.
My best wishes to all sportspersons.
Today, I congratulate all the tears of the All India Radio.
Therefore, I convey my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to all my colleagues at the Kannur Radio Station.
Once again I would like to mention Kerala.
The students of Dhuya Mary Upper Primary School of Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter has a variety of characteristics.
One, these girls had registered their thumb map and placed the furnace of Bharat Mata in a big cloth.
You have sent me the map of Bharat Mata.
I was surprised to know why they took their thumb map records and why did they take this film.
But after reading the letter they wrote, I knew how great they had sent to me.
They are engaged in the movement of awareness about organ donation.
Around 80 years old Vasant Rao Suduke Guru ji has been organising a movement for a long time.
He says body donation should be celebrated as a festival.
Nowadays, many news and information are coming to me through the phone.
Devesh Ji of Delhi has also sent me a message like this.
I talk to Devesh from Delhi - I am very happy to note that the government's efforts to donate organ donation and the policy plans related to it.
The countries like China are in a very advanced position in the matter of organ donation and I feel that the goal of donating a body organ for over 10 lakhs of the government is commendable and this is very important.
Over 12 lakh kidneys, heart and liver donors are required every year in the country.
But in the country with 125 crore people, we can only implement 5000 organ transformations.
There is a need to give light to one lakh eyes every year.
But we can only blindly give only 25,000 people.
If four people need eyes, we can only give it to one person.
Efforts have been made to guide the State Governments in this regard.
Some states have made good progress in the efforts to simplify and eradicate governance processes in this regard.
I am telling you that Tamil Nadu plays the leading role in body donation.
A 24-hour Helpline is being served through the number 1800 11-4770.
Our ancestors have also turned away as honey punjeetha
That is, they have said the joy of sacrifice through the words of Honey Dayakden Punjeetha.
In the last few days, Delhi's GST has been implemented.
The surgery was successful and a life was saved.
After a few days we are going to celebrate the festival of Diwali.
We also celebrated the festival of Eid and Ganapati Chaturthi.
The Indian Africa Conclave is scheduled to be held in New Delhi from 26th to 29th October, 2018.
This is the first time that such a big conference is being held in Indian soil.
The leaders of 54 African countries and Unions have been invited to participate in the conference.
The population of our two countries is one-third of the world.
Millions ago, India and Africa had been the same world, and then it is said to be two parts of the Indian Ocean.
There are immense unity between us.
India's wildlife and Africa's wildlife can see many confessions.
There is a lot of harmony in natural resources.
About 27 lakh Indians have lived in Africa for years.
The relationship between India and Africa is in the field of economy, culture and politics.
But above all, India has played a big role in training the younger generation of African countries.
More than 25,000 African students have been educated in the field of human resource development and skill development.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has organised an important event.
Competitions are being organised in the field of writing poetry and enhancing their contribution among all the students of schools connected to the CBSE.
Thousands of school students wrote about the information about Indian African relations.
Millions of school students saw this exhibition, the villagers saw it, what was the contribution of Atal Gandhiji in the interaction between Africa and India, all the people knew how his impact was on the minds of the people of these two lands.
There were many important contributions in this competition.
I like a poet with my heart, so I want to teach you this.
I congratulate all the students who have participated in this Poti, more than 1600 schools and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
On August 15, 2014, I had mentioned about the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, a Member of Parliament, Model Gram Yojana.
After that many members have completed this work.
They are all involved in this.
Last month a poll was held in Bhopal.
In this context, the leaders of the villages that have been implemented in this Model Gram Yojana, the district rulers, some MPs and officials from the Central State Governments, were also involved in a detailed discussion on the Model Gram Yojana.
Through this, many new ideas were emerged and inspired.
I would definitely like to bring some things to your attention.
Jharkhand is one of the most tribal areas.
Unfortunately, it is the Mao extremists, the bombing culture and the massacre that we talk about Jharkhand.
Many parts have been destroyed by the impact of the left-wing extremists.
But our senior parliamentarian Karya Munda, who has been the Deputy Chairman of the Parliament of that part, has dedicated his life to the tribal people.
He started visiting the place, he raised the confidence in the people, tried to give life to the government systems, inspired the officers to come and work there.
He created a country to bring development in that area which had long been neglected.
Besides infrastructure in the Model Gram Yojana, the successful effort to create awareness among the people was made in this Bursi village of Jharkhand.
I convey my best wishes to the Honourable Member of Parliament, Kariya Munda.
Other arrangements are being made and he has made a special innovation in this regard.
He handed over a job to the students studying in the schools there.
He asked the upper classes of school students to study their parents in this class.
The school was in the same way educating students in the morning and their parents in the evening.
The same children had taught about 550 uneducated senior citizens.
Look, without any budget in the society, without roaming around, without any special facility, how big a change has been made by just mindset.
This is the song of the village panchayat of Dwarpuri.
This village is known for the production of black pepper and black pepper festival.
Ruwala ji inaugurated the Karamput Festival on 11th March in this village.
He has attracted our attention to the right point.
My dear countrymen, I would like to remind you of this thing and after the festival of Diwali last year, the media has organized a campaign in our country, especially in our country.
Your opinion is that even after the festivals, however we are making efforts towards cleanliness before the festivals, even after the festivals.
This kind of work should be done during every public event.
Today, I congratulate all the media of India.
On October 2, Gandhiji's birth anniversary and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched and on the completion of one year, the India Today Group had got the opportunity to participate in the event Safai Giri.
He has been encouraging Swachhta for the last one year through ETV, and there are colours in his newspapers about this, he has only focused on constructive work.
He has added 51 lakh children of about 55-56,000 schools from Andhra and Telangana to Swachh Bharat Mission.
Be it public places, railway stations, pilgrimage sites, hospitals, parks, cleanliness campaigns are being organised in many places.
These news are also strengthening the creation of a clean India.
ABP News Channel has launched a programme titled 'India My Country'.
The people of the country have sown the idea of cleanliness in the minds of the people to take forward the awareness of cleanliness among the people.
NDTV organised a Swachh Bharat Mission.
There are many channels and newspapers in our country and I have not been able to mention the names of everyone because of the lack of time but everyone has taken this movement.
Over the past several years, this village has been working as a pillar of cleanliness and every generation has been taking the issue of cleanliness in a rapid way.
A few years ago, the governor wrote in the letter that this village has been awarded as Asia's most clean village.
I am happy to note that a village in Meghalaya, a remote north-eastern region of our country, has been engaged in cleanliness for several years.
This has become the culture of the village.
Such events give us confidence that our country is surely clean.
My dear countrymen, I had said that when I was speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, corruption was in the country.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
In the last budget, we had made an important announcement.
Accordingly, you can pay your gold to the bank and get the interest for your investments, as well as the gold stored in the bank.
Now the gold will be in the bank, but the money will be given to you through the bank interest.
Now tell me, people of the country, don't wear gold or not
Wouldn't the gold that has been utilized to turn into a life-force
Don't keep gold in the house waste.
Do not mislead the benefits of its security and circulation.
So we don't have to buy gold, don't have to preserve gold, nobody will have to make the paper.
I will definitely dedicate this scheme to the people of the country that will provide security in the next week.
However, we have so far utilised foreign gold currency or have been using foreign gold bindings.
Why shouldn't there be an indigenous index for our country
Thus, in the coming week, the Indian gold coin will be released before the Holy Day of Dantres, 5 grams and 10 grams of Ashoka Chakra.
Moreover, 20 grams of gold will also be provided to the people.
I am sure that this new scheme will bring a new transformation in the path of economic development and I will have full cooperation in it.
My dear countrymen, Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji on 31st October.
When Patel thinks about them, the whole of India will be inspired by the idea of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
This great man has contributed to India's integration.
Not only these varieties, but the beauty that has given us pride will not be near to us.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the roots of development.
Over the past several years, unity has taken place on 31st October.
I have got the opportunity to participate in it before.
I am told that this system is being organised in various areas and people are engaged in preparations for unity with enthusiasm.
Unity flow is actually a drive towards development.
On the other hand, the guarantee for development is unity.
Come, let us convey our tributes to Sardar Ji.
We will take forward the mantra of unity.
My dear brothers and sisters, you all are engaged in preparations for the festival of Diwali.
I specially ask the parents to enjoy the festival of Deepawali, but even if you want to see that there is no harm to our children.
My dear countrymen, the next day I will go to Britain on Diwali.
This time my visit to Britain is very interesting.
There is a special reason for this.
I am confident that when our children are going to study in Britain, this memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be a tourist destination for them and a conception centre.
As far as possible, learning and livelihood for the country, this is the message of Baba Saheb Ambedkar who has not lived.
It is a matter of understanding that the work done by Lord Basaveshwar for democracy and the empowerment of women has been done several years ago.
The statue of Bhagwan Basaveshwar in London is an excellent example of the vision of the ideas of the great people of India several centuries ago.
When such an event comes together, the hearts of all the people of the country are filled with swords.
I have the color of your suggestions.
Later, with your letters, programmes are being prepared in All India Radio, government officials are being welcomed and debated, some people are trying to solve their problems when they write about their problems.
We need to learn many languages in a country like India.
Though I have got the idea of learning some languages, it is true that I cannot learn so many languages.
I will definitely try to enter your minds in your language at 8 pm.
See how much our relationship has grown.
The last one year was completed.
Today we have stepped up in the new year.
Once again my heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you, this is the 12th event of Mann Ki Baat.
There is a great significance for the people's power in democracy.
There is an idea that is based on my life, because of which I have great faith in this manpower.
However, the voice of Mann Ki Baat has learnt many things, they have been transformed into experiences and all of us have been aware of how great is the power of the people.
Our ancestors have made it clear that Jan Shakti Mahasan Shakti is powerful.
I can say that with the experiences I have received in the Mann Ki Baat, the ideas of our ancestors have great power and great truth.
In this regard, I congratulate All India Radio and they have not seen these suggestions as just a paper, they have seen it as the expectations of the people.
In terms of administration, information should be from the bottom to the bottom and the guidance should be from the top to the bottom.
Who would have thought that Mann Ki Baat will become a voice for the spread of information
But this has become the same.
On October 2, we had said that we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
There was a time when there were doors for the country, but shouldn't it be the doors for the speech today
No more, I said buy a little bit.
I am happy to note that in the last one year, the sale of doors has been almost two.
It is difficult to break the subsidy for the common man of the society, the middle elite and the middle elite.
Nevertheless, they cast it off.
Isn't it a peace revolution
Is it not a manifestation of manpower
Beyond the authority circle of the government sectors, there is a great manpower, which is empowered, efficient and determined.
Those whom I had faith in, after the Mann Ki Baat programme, all these things have turned into my determination.
Therefore, today I would like to once again bow to the people's power through Mann Ki Baat.
People thought of the small things I had said, they made themselves for the welfare of the country and added them to it.
What can be more pleasant than this
This time I thought of adopting a new approach to Mann Ki Baat.
I urge the people of the country to contact you through the phone and register your questions and your advice.
Consultations have been concentrated from all parts of India to the extent that the calls are no place.
It's a pleasant experience.
All the adults have given advice.
It was also comfortable to hear some suggestions, and my team is focusing on others.
You might have spoken for a couple of minutes, but your suggestions and news are very important for me.
The government will definitely pay full attention to your suggestions.
It appears usually that negative thoughts are filled all around
But my experience is different.
Moreover, in particular, the calls from the disabled and the visually impaired have received more calls.
They cannot see televisions, but radio is a major reason.
Bhawan Acharya Ji of Alwar region of Rajasthan is sharing a report with me.
I want all the people of the country to listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji and follow it.
My name is Pavan Acharya, I am from Alwar region of Rajasthan.
On the occasion of Diwali, I urge the people of the country to use soil-crossed lights in a large number, to appeal to the people of the country in their Mann Ki Baat.
Moreover, he has been asking the poor people who do so will get employment while they do not have pollution in the environment.
Whenever we listen to the advice of Bhawan Acharya Ji during the coming festivals, the soil lights will be used in our houses but I appeal to the people of the country that its light will fall in the family of the poor.
My dear countrymen, during the Ganesh Chaturthi, I had the opportunity to spend some time with the three soldiers.
At the end of 50 years of war with Pakistan in 1965, an exhibition is being organised near India Gate in Delhi.
We have been asked about the glorious moments of the war, the unprecedented courage and sacrifice of our soldiers and the photographs or films of that period are not there.
If you want to create history, you should understand the signs of history well.
History connects us with our roots.
Cleanliness should be our natural, we should also create the means for it.
I don't think it was wrong.
I see this well that the Parliament of the country is also involved in discussions about cleanliness.
On the other hand, on the other hand, what can be a matter of pride for the country than that both the children of the country are talking about cleanliness
The movement of ideas is taking place and an environment against pollution has created a awareness about cleanliness.
Do you know what Gandhiji said
Once he said that if I want to choose one among the people of freedom and cleanliness then I would like cleanliness first and then it is the freedom of the country.
Cleanliness was more important than freedom for Gandhijis.
Kulshan Arora of Delhi has registered a report on MyGov portal.
Deen Dayal Udayai wants to know about his centuries.
Even last year, I had said that the clothes of various types of fashions may be of different kinds, but I had to say that they should be with them.
I want somewhere to leave it.
Last time you have almost doubled the sales.
How many poor people have benefited from this
You have completed the work that the government cannot spend crores of rupees with a small help.
Therefore, I once again request you all about this thing.
My dear countrymen, my heart is also happy for another thing.
I want to share this with you.
In May, I went to Kolkata and the family members of Subhash Bose had come to meet me.
His brother, son Chandra Bose, organized the meeting.
Chandra Bose and his family were involved in this work and it was decided last week that more than 50 families of Subhash Bose ji are coming to the Prime Minister's house.
Can you imagine how much this is a matter of great happiness to me
Many of Subhas Babu's family live in other countries.
Do you know what a matter of great pleasure to me that everyone is coming for this purpose
I look forward to welcoming them.
We have to take it as a habit.
I would like the youth of the country to make efforts to connect themselves to the electoral roll and participate in the voter.
In the elections, I am sure to say one thing, the first voter and then all others.
Everyone should do this sacred work.
Among them, I met a young boy studying the seventh grade Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying the seventh grade at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Banaras Hindu University.
Likewise, there was a chance to meet a girl named Sonam Patel.
The daughter of Sathawaruj Patel, who lives in Sundarpur, Varanasi, is 9 years old.
She is a woman from a very poor family.
The whole singing of this little girl is under the head, but the greatest thing is that when she heard about some sympathy of the song, she gave it to her and gave her English interpretation and Hindi language.
When I asked her father about this, she said that she has been telling this from the age of 5.
He added that this is a matter of surprise to all of us in the family.
This has made me a big impact in yourself.
Some children have an interest in popularity, but children have no interest in Sonamuko.
I just realized that God has given her some special power.
It is a special thing that I met these two children during my visit to Kashi.
I wanted to share this with you.
Once a month, you should make Mann Ki Baat a week because we get more conception than these.
And you, Sindib, do you not know what you want to buy from me
Now it is better to be a monthly period.
Mann Ki Baat has been completed for one year.
Do you know how Subhash Babu used the planet
He launched a broadcast in Germany, spreading his ideas through radio for the people living in India.
The launch of Azad Hind Radio was done through a weekly report.
He broadcast radio in many languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjab, Urudu and Pashtu.
My radio broadcast has also completed one year through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Your contribution is an invaluable price for me.
My best wishes to you all again.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
Once again, I am fortunate to tell you the voice of my mind.
In the southern part of the country, people are celebrating Omam festival and Raksha Bandhan festival was celebrated all over the country yesterday.
The Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security keeping in mind the interests of the people.
I am glad that in a very short time, all of them have joined themselves in these schemes in a wide range.
On the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, I had given a small appeal to our sisters to bring the benefits of these security schemes.
I am told that in a short span of time, about 11 crore families have been connecting themselves with this scheme.
I am happy that half of the beneficiaries are mothers and sisters.
I consider this as a good sign.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
About a year ago, we started implementing the Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Several questions and doubts were raised whether a scheme that could not be completed in 60 years could be implemented in such a short span of time.
However, it is a matter of happiness that all the departments associated with the implementation of this scheme and all the branches of the banks have been engaged in it with full force and mind and we have succeeded in this thing.
Even though it was said that the possibilities could start, they have saved Rs 22,000 crore in it.
The banking sector is one of the major incentives of the economy, which has reached the houses of the poor.
Today 1.
25 lakh bank allies are working on the ground.
This has provided employment opportunities to the youth.
Now tens of thousands of people have been empowered to take overdraft because of this Jan Dhan scheme.
There is hope that the poor will get bank loans.
Once again I convey my best wishes and best wishes to all those associated with this, and I appeal to all the poor people not to break your relationship with the banks at any time.
Banks are yours, don't leave you in any way.
We have brought banks to the doors of your houses, do not leave it, take it thick.
We all have to have money in the bank accounts.
I am unbelievable that you will definitely do this.
In the past few days, the events in Gujarat and the violence of the entire country have lost peace, this is a natural feeling.
This kind of incident occurred on the land of Gandhi and Sardar, which causes deep sorrow and pain to all the people of the country.
Peace, unity and brotherhood - this path is right
All of us should stand shoulder to shoulder on the path of progress.
Progress can only be solved for all our problems.
Jawaharlal Nehru ji, the first Prime Minister of India, visited Buddha Gaya.
I am proud that the Buddhists from all over the world participate in this event.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, once again I would like to share the voice of my mind with you.
I am ready to accept any suggestion regarding the welfare of the farmers and I have been telling it several times.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I don't want my farmers to die, don't be afraid.
I assure you that if anybody tries to guide you in the wrong path, we will not take any action to replace it.
For us, every citizen of the country has a value but the ideas and voices of the farmers have a unique significance.
We brought an emergency law.
The period of the Ordinance is to be completed with effect from 31st August, 2019.
This will ensure that farmers do not suffer economically.
For us, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan are not mere words but I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that this is a mantra.
The interests of the poor farmers living in the villages are in our minds.
That is why I had mentioned in my Independence Day speech that the Ministry should work not only in the field of agriculture but also in the field of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
We are moving ahead with this resolution at a fast pace.
I want to talk about another thing.
Two days ago, the war ended in 1965 and completed 50 years.
Whenever we talk about the war in 1965, it is a natural thing to remember Lal Bahadur Shastriji.
Similarly, the words of Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan will also be remembered.
Our scientists are actually making significant progress.
Several new information has been given to me.
This was meant to be conceptualized and educated.
Several young scientists have shared with me very vibrant things and I have dreamed a lot in their eyes.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had said that I should guide our student wealth towards science.
Even during my Independence Day speech, I had spoken about the need for an indirect examination in the following tasks.
During the indirect election calls, every poor family and widow mothers have to face issues related to getting a letter of recommendations, seeking help from anyone to get jobs.
This is also one of the reasons for corruption in the bottom.
I had said that there should not be an indirect examination under a specific position.
I am glad that the government is progressing rapidly in this direction, suggestions are being made, this resolution will be fulfilled almost and the way of an alternate examination for lower level jobs will be tired.
In today's days, there are colours of multilateral dignitaries coming to India.
In order to reduce the maternal and child mortality rate, 24 countries of the world had organized a conference in India in coordination with the implementation of Call to Action Plans.
For the first time outside the US, this conception was held in India.
Every year in our country, about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die after delivery.
Just as we get rid of polio, we have also been freed from tetanus because of maternal mortality.
The world has accepted this.
But even today, we must save our mothers and save our children.
Brothers and sisters, Today the fever of dengue is spreading.
It is true that dengue fever is dangerous, but it is very simple to avoid it.
My appeal to Swachh Bharat is related to it.
Even if we see advertising on television, our attention does not go on them.
Even if publicity is made in the newspapers, our children are not paid in it.
Awareness is being made to the people in small matters of households and clean water conservation systems.
However, we don't care about it, we live in good houses, there are many facilities, but sometimes we don't know about the accumulation of water around us.
I urge you not to expand such a sword in such a simple way for death.
Life is very valuable.
It is not true that the lack of focus on water storage and the neglect of cleanliness are the calls for death.
Approximately 514 dengue fever detection centres have been set up across the country, where free tests are being conducted.
The timely testing and treatment is one of the best for life savings.
Your greater cooperation is very important in this regard.
From Raksha Bandhan to Deepawali, festivals and festivals will be filled in the coming days of our country.
Why shouldn't we connect all our festivals with cleanliness
Good records will become a habit, right
My dear countrymen, I would like to share a happy information with you.
Hidendra Mahajan, Dr.
The interests of our tribal people have improved in the minds of Mahendra Mahajan.
These two brothers are proud of India.
This year, these two brothers have won this thing and have made India proud.
I convey my best wishes and congratulations to these two brothers.
But in all these endeavours, they are taking into consideration the interests of Team India, Vision for Tribals.
See how everyone is contributing to the progress of the country.
When asked about such events, the chest is proud.
Sometimes, because of our perspective, we do wrong to our younger generations.
There is a concept that the older generations do not know anything for the new generation and I believe that this trend has been for centuries.
But my experience was different from the younger community.
Sometimes when we talk to the youth, we can also learn many things.
I have met many youngsters who have decided to ride a cycle on Sunday.
Some people are following it as a cycle day that one day I will travel in a cycle.
They say that this will also give me the joy of my health, well-being and environmental benefits and youth.
Cycle clubs are operating in many cities of our country and there are many people who are also encouraging cycle travel.
This is a good effort for health and environmental well-being.
Just as the achievement of two youngsters of India has made the country proud, the attitude of the youth of the country is also worth mentioning.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's memorial in the Hindu Mills land of Mumbai has been embarrassed for a long time.
When Indians around the world visit London, the memorial of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will be set up by the Maharashtra government there.
I convey my heartfelt prayers and congratulations to the state government of Maharashtra, who is trying to build these two memorials to pride Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My best wishes to you and my best wishes.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor need pulses and need a little thought to include porridges.
I am glad that there is an increase of 50 percent of the pulses in the present system and I am glad that there is an increase of about 33 percent in oil crops.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to my farmer brothers for this matter.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July is described as a successful day in the history of our country, in the Kargil war.
The Kargil war is not only on the borders but every village and city of India has contributed to it.
On July 26, I consider it more important for another thing.
In a few months after our government was formed in 2014, we launched mygov portal on July 26.
I am glad that nearly two crore people have gone to MyGov portal and about 5. 12 lakh people have come to know about their views.
More than 50,000 people have given their suggestions in the PMO application, and have spent their golden time for this, and have given their child to it, it is even more pleasant that they consider it as an important one.
They have given very good advice.
However, the people of the government have not been able to pay attention to this thing, but the government has taken into consideration the advice of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee and we are implementing it today.
Today, any scheme of the government is being set up with logo-tag lines, projects are being initiated, policies are being created and very positive suggestions are being received on the MyGov website.
Now, on the 15th of August, suggestions have also begun to come to me in Mygov.
Suchitra Kadavachari from Chennai has given me several suggestions.
Beti Bachao Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, Swachh Ganga and Swachh Bharat should be spoken.
This is an idea in my mind and you can register your views on what I should talk about on August 15.
Let's send it to the MyGov office, write it to the radio and send it to the Prime Minister's office.
It is a pleasant idea that I should get the place to get in my speech on August 15.
Definitely you will give me good ideas.
Two days ago, my condolence went on an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the life of the person who traveled in the scooter was rubbed for ten minutes.
He did not get any help.
People have been asking me on several occasions that you should talk about road safety and create awareness.
Your concerns are right.
If we observe the statistics, the heart will stand.
There is an accident in our country every minute.
I urge the parents to create an environment involving a child driving vehicle, a two-wheeler vehicle or a four-wheeler vehicle, whatever it is, to adopt all aspects of security.
In this regard, the government has also set up several initiatives, be it road safety awareness, road construction engineering, law enforcement, immediate treatment to the injured after the accident, we are bringing the Road Transport and Security Bill.
In the coming days, we are planning to make several important efforts to implement the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
In the national highways like Kutgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara, Mumbai and Ranchi, we are focusing on the treatment of washles.
Accordingly, we are thinking about how to provide the best life-saving and maintenance in the first 50 hours, keeping in mind the matters related to whom money is not available.
We must first approach this with the point of view of how accidents are not happening, in fact every life is priceless.
Sometimes I say that the workers should be Karma Yogis.
In the last few days, I share with you some of the events that touched my heart with this idea.
It feels a good feeling to see how everyone can bring life in the work they know.
Vijay Biswal ji has expressed how he can connect his country, his artistic compassion and his strength with his work.
I hope that Vijay Biswal ji's painting will be a thing to speak in the days to come.
I am very keen that a big group of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh is working towards me.
Sometimes, even small things are very happy, so I share them with you.
There is a village called Keshla in Rajnandka, Chhattisgarh
Over the past few months, they have tried to create a toilet movement.
Now no one from that village needs to spend natural resources in the open.
However, when it was completed, the entire village celebrated it like a big festival.
The best examples of how values change in social life, how people's perspective is changing, how citizens of the country are moving forward.
Pavesh Dey of Guwahati has written to me about the problems faced by the North-Eastern states.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister of the country, a ministry named DONER was formed, which means that the Ministry of Development of the North Eastern States.
Well, we can't decide the interests of the North-Eastern states by sitting in Delhi or not
Hence, a group of officials of the Government of India visited the North-Eastern region of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Sikkim.
This endeavour is going to have good results in the coming days.
This is an extraordinary effort to move from Delhi to far-flung areas and this is what I call the ACT EAST policy.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the success of the Seowai Satellite Travel Programme.
In the past few days, India has launched 5 UK satellites through its PSLV C28.
Though this news is not one of the most attractive, this is a big achievement.
Sometimes when we ask the young people of the country about what you want after your development, one of them is the maximum number of scientists.
It is a matter of concern that the country is looking less about science.
Under this, the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India has launched a National Innovation Mission.
I have been asking the officers of the Government of India to share your experiences with the students of the school and colleges around you for one and a half hours a week.
Our villages should get 24 hours of electricity or not
Though this work is difficult, it should be fulfilled.
Today, even if we want to charge the mobile, we have to go to another village.
The benefits available to the cities should be expanded to the villages and these facilities should be provided to the poorest of the market.
That is why we have started the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti.
Our country is the largest country, there are thousands of villages here and to ensure electricity supply to the remotest areas.
Your views will be helpful to me.
Thank you very much.
When I said so, I don't expect to get such a huge amount of answers from you.
Millions of people sent photographs through Twitter, Festival and Instagram.
I have retweeted some of them that have attracted my mind.
If some people did not register the photographs of Andhra Pradesh (B) Belum Caves, it would have been known that many people of the country have such caves.
This is the same picture of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh.
We always know Rajasthan as a water deficient state, but it is very surprising when one sends photographs of Manal waterfalls from there.
That is, in fact, a wonderful thing has happened.
I can assure that Yoga practices are not sunset in the world.
What kind of red brightness the world is spreading Yoga, when it sees it, no Indian has the pride and pride in his heart
I was also in the flood of joy, and the heart was furious.
While the Chinese river and the Eiffel Tower are very proud symbols for the people of France, they have also chosen these symbols in the posterior place to practice yoga.
The New York people have learned the Times Square for Yoga.
When Australia speaks of Sydney, the APERA House scenes are brightening.
The Australian people performed Yoga in front of the APERA House Symbol.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
A new uprising, a new feeling, a new zeal and a new zeal in all the crores of the world could be felt.
A few days ago, a child from Vietnam had tweeted a photograph of Yoga, which was very charming, and it was famous all over the world.
Women, men, adults, children, villagers, urban residents, developing countries and developing countries are all involved in Yoga practices.
Yoga is indeed a factor in connecting the world.
I don't know how the world of intellectuals will wash and criticize this event.
But I feel one thing, it is a matter of pride to every Indian that the world is very interested in learning about India.
The world is keen to know about India's values, heritage and culture.
But if we have the pride and pride of our tradition then we can explain it to the world.
Sometimes we think what is innovation in this, for example, we can tell our family values and we do not know that India's family values are the biggest thing for the people of the world.
I will appeal to the youth of the country, especially the youth in the field of Information Technology. This is the request that the youth of the country should jointly plan online yoga activities.
Do you know that there is a sector called Ayush in the government
Nobody's attention will be turned back to it.
In five years, there will be news about it two-four times, a small area in one corner.
But during Yoga Day, it was presided over.
The smallest sector has shown the biggest work in the world.
This is an example of how smaller organisations can fulfil the greatest tasks when the goal is in front of us.
The world was surprised to see how our people rescued the victims of the Eman country.
In a few hours, the world had seen that Indians had taken the help of Nepal quickly.
If we start working with a determination in our mind, then the government will be working fast and the government workers will work fast and the common man will celebrate with his head.
This is my own experience.
This is the real power of the country's progress.
Last month, we had announced three people's life insurance schemes from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been involved in life insurance schemes, but we have to take it forward further.
There is a thought in my mind, and I want to put it before you.
In August, the festival of Raksha Bandhan comes, the people of the country should start a strong mass movement before the Raksha Bandhan festival. These people should provide the benefits of life insurance to our mothers and sisters.
Come, let us all work together to fulfil this commitment.
When I sing the voice of Mann Ki Baat, many people give me advice.
This time many people have advised me to tell me something about the rainy season.
Thiruvananthapuram, Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpuri, Harsh Vardhan of Mysore, Praveen Dinakarni and Divyaanshu Gupta have been asking you to speak in your hearts about the rainy season.
They have given good ideas to their share.
You too may have been enjoying this rainy season with the hot bakoda, bajji and sowing tea.
Just as the sun's rays give us life, the rain also gives us energy.
Every drop of rain is valued.
As a citizen and as a society, we must develop a feeling of saving water from every drop.
The water in the village should be used in the same way as the water in the city should be used in the villages.
Whether it is vaccines, water management, small ponds, lakes, we should protect every drop of water.
If you want to visit Porbandar, the birthplace of Gandhiji, then if you can see his house then you can see that there is a pool of water storage in his 200-year-old house in which rain water has been provided directly.
You must see it.
Even at that time, this amount has been taken up.
We can't even do this
This should be transformed into a mass movement.
The village should be followed by this method.
Similarly, the greenery steals our eyes.
How charming is the green life
All these trees, plants, gardens and gardens turn life into greenery, don't they
We all have to implement tree plantation and related movements in this rainy season through social organisations and the youth in a big way.
I offer a suggestion from my own experience, this rural technology is very successful.
When you plant, put an old clay near the plant, fill it with water.
Health is very important because microbes are growing due to moisture in the environment.
Cleanliness is very important.
It is necessary to drink clean water .
Most people boil water during this season.
That's why good things are there.
As much as we pay attention, we can be safeguarded from diseases.
Water is also required and rain, but it is important to be safe from the moment of the disease.
Friends, We have now introduced three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
Under the Amrit scheme, we have set up a mission to make our cities easier to live.
In 2022, when India celebrates the 75th anniversary of its independence, the houses should be built to all Indians.
Keeping in view these three things, we have started a big project.
This has inspired all parents to take selfie photographs with their daughters and register on social websites.
In Haryana, the rate of female children is very low as compared to male children.
There are 100 districts of this kind of concern in the country.
This is very high in Haryana.
In some way, we will make the scheme 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' as a peoples movement.
Keep watching, you will feel that how much the promotion of daughters, the pride and the Beti Bachao Mission will give you happiness
Take the rainy season nice
Make our country green
I am experiencing this.
Take it forward.
I will meet you the next time for the next Mann Ki Baat programme.
Sometimes some people think that I should declare my Mann Ki Baat programme only about the welfare schemes of the government.
This is what gives me happiness.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You can imagine how this intermediate period has passed.
On Sunday, the last Sunday of the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, and the feeling that something was left out of me, and that is how it is for you
But I thought that if it had appeared then - no, it had to be a function on Sunday.
But I was eagerly awaiting when this Sunday will come.
Many have asked me why I was traveling to Kedarnath in the midst of the election campaign.
But if I started traveling in that direction, then the voice of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Hence, the estimation of the election process and the defeat of victory, and the polling continues, I rose up.
Many believe it is a political instrument.
For me, I consider it as an opportunity to meet me.
In a way I'm gonna meet myself.
I can't tell you when I will do, but I will definitely do because it is my duty to know when you want to know.
As the people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, I am consistently aware of your efforts to strengthen positive things.
The inclusions in the letters of Mann Ki Baat are completely different from the beneficial government functions.
Your words are sometimes opening the dust between my thoughts.
When one writes about cleanliness, he expresses his anger against cleanliness and supports the efforts of cleaning.
If one discusses the environment, his pain reflects in it
But at the same time, he describes his efforts and describes his thoughts in his mind.
That is, in a way, a vision of how the solution to problems can be incorporated to the entire society will be reflected in his words.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat is a glass for the country and the society.
It shows that there is no dearth in the depths of the people of the country, in the strength and capabilities.
It is necessary to integrate these strengths and capabilities, create opportunities for them and involve constructive efforts.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat tells us that 130 crore people want to join the country in a strong and positive way.
One writes a letter to the Prime Minister of the country, but I can imagine that he has not submitted any application for himself.
... how high will the feelings of millions of people of the country be
When I review these things, I leave your imagination of how much joy I feel and how much zeal is there in me.
You can't imagine that you are driving me yourself, you are running me fast, you can't imagine that every moment you're putting your life in me...
Without this relationship, I was waiting for the escape.
Today my heart is filled with happiness.
Inside this feeling, we will take forward the voice chain of Mann Ki Baat.
While an emergency arises in the country, the struggles against it have not stopped with political limitations or political leaders.
It has not been imprisoned between the prison camps.
There was anger in every citizen's mind.
There was a vision for far-reaching democracy.
I don't know what if we are hungry every day.
Likewise, whenever one comes to know about the rights of democracy and the joy that it gives in normal life, one is only when one breaks our democratic rights.
During the period of emergency, every citizen from all over the country realized that he had broken something or the other.
I can proudly say that India is a poor society because of this tradition.
That's why the people of the country realized the lack of democracy, and during the emergency we felt this lack.
Therefore, the country, not for itself, but for the entire election, was dedicated to the security of democracy.
When any thing or thing is away from us, we underestimate the importance of it, we ignore its miracles.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.
This number may seem simple to us, but if we see China from the world's perspective, more people have voted in this election than any country in the world.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the entire US voter, which is more than the entire European voter.
This reflects the widerness and widerness of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections in 2019 have so far been the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine how great things and human resource will be required to manage such a huge election.
This has been possible as a result of millions of teachers, officers and workers working hard for the night.
Their hard work has resulted in a more polling station than the past.
Around 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh polling machines and more than 17 lakh weaveweight devices...
I leave your imagination of the magnificence of the arrangements.
All these were implemented to ensure that no voter should deny the right to vote.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, only one voter was set up for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the election officers took two days to visit there.
This is the true respect given to democracy.
Polling in the world's highest position is in India itself.
The poll is at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahaul Spiti, Himachal Pradesh.
Besides, there is another thing to be proud of this election.
This is also the first time in history that women and women have participated in the vote with enthusiasm for men.
In this election, the percentage of voting for women and men was almost the same.
One more encouraging thing about this is that today the number of women members in the House is 78.
My dear countrymen, you might have heard me often saying that Bugyal is not Bugyal.
I was asking you to give books instead of flowers during the moments of welcome and pride.
Since then, people have started giving books in many places.
Now one has given me a book titled Fremchand's famous stories and I love it very much.
There have been no time for many days but due to his visit abroad, he has got the opportunity to read some stories again.
Premchand describes the reality of the society in his stories and when he reads, the scenes start immigrating in your mind as a painting.
Everything he wrote is alive.
My young days were shadowed in my mind...
Secondly, it touched the depths of my mind, whose name is Idgah.
The understanding of a young man's grace, the clean love that he has with him, and his heart is full of grace in such a young age.
When the 4-5-year-old Hamid festivity buys a bread shirt and comes to his daughter, the human emotion indeed touches the peak.
Likewise, the name of a young man who touches the chest is Bhusky Rath.
In this story, a contradiction in the lives of a poor farmer has been depicted alive.
Even after the destruction of his crops, the farmer Haldhu is happy that he does not need sleep in his field in the winters of bones.
But these stories were written almost a century ago, but we feel that these are still suitable.
After reading these things, I felt a different experience.
While talking about the subject of reading, I was reading in some media about Akshara Library in Kerala.
Sometimes, they have come to bind books in lips and weight in the back.
Today this library is showing a new direction not only to tribal children but also to everyone.
The Vanche Gujarat Mission of Gujarat is a successful effort.
All the elderly have participated in this movement to read books.
In today's digital world, I would like to ask you to take some time to place books in the middle of your daily routine.
In fact, you are very enjoying this and write on your reading books and on the Narendra Modi App, so that Mann Ki Baat lovers can also know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to know that our countrymen are also thinking about the challenges that will be faced in the future.
When I was studying these ideas in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I was able to note that many people had written about water.
Besides Bhawan Gaurai of Belgavi and Siddamsu Mohan Farida of Bhubaneswar, many others have written about water related challenges like Yash Sharma and Shahab Altaf.
Water has a great significance in our culture.
It is said about the water in the danger of Rikveda - Apohista Mayobuva: Sthan Kaje Dadadhana, Maharanaya Sakshe, Yova: Shivadamoras: Dasya Bajaydehna: Ushtriva Madra: , , , , , , , , , i.e. water itself feels the energy and energy.
Your mother is equal to mother, mother is blessings and compassion on us.
Water conservation affects many parts of the country every year.
You can be surprised to know that only 8 percent of the water available throughout the year due to rain can be stored in our country.
Only 8 percent.
Therefore, it was time to find a solution to this problem.
I am confident that with the help of peoples participation, with the help of other issues, with the opening of 130 crore people through Jan Shakti, with the help of collaboration and mindset, this problem can be solved.
Considering the importance of water, a new Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country.
Through this, all the matters related to water will be decided at a quick pace.
A few days ago, I was supposed to do different things.
I had a letter to the Panchayat leaders and the villagers of the country.
And I wrote a letter to them, that they should gather the villages together, and enter into consultation with the villagers, to store water, to keep every drop of rain water.
I am glad that they have been involved in this work and on 22nd this month, millions of people participated in thousands of panchayats.
People from every village have made a pledge to save every drop of water and have contributed to their work.
Today, at the Mann Ki Baat event, I would like to talk to you about one party leader.
The people there have once again agreed to fulfill their positive contribution to water conservation.
My best wishes to all the Panchayat leaders and all the villagers who have done a constructive work from my side.
There are many leaders who have made such a challenge for water conservation across the country.
In a way, it is an opportunity for the entire village.
There is a feeling in my mind that the villagers of the village are now participating in the temples of some water in their villages.
As I said, positive results are being achieved through social efforts.
There is no only way to face water constraints throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different ways in different parts of the country.
But the goal of all is to save water and to maintain water.
The waste water canals of Punjab are being improved.
This effort will liberate the problem of blockages.
Due to the setting up of water pools in Thimayyapalli of Telangana, the lives of the villagers are changing.
There has been a major change in Kabirdham in Rajasthan due to small ponds built in the fields.
While I was studying about a social effort in Vellore in Tamil Nadu, I knew that there were 20,000 women in the work of reviving the river Naga.
At the same time, I have also read about the women of the Garhwal region, who have worked very well with each other in connection with rain water storage.
When people gather, water will be stored.
Today, through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have made three appeals to the people of the country.
My first appeal - just as the people of the country have converted cleanliness into a mass movement, let us also launch the launch of water conservation as a mass movement.
Together, let us all resolve to save every drop of water and I hope that you are God's gift, it is a wonderful jealousy.
It was said that the iron would be gold if this rosemary was finished.
But water is also such a rasamani, the sprinkling of water produces new life.
We have to set up a campaign to save every drop of water and save awareness.
My second appeal to the people of the country is: Several traditional methods of water conservation have been used for centuries in our country.
I urge all of you to share these traditional methods.
If someone of you gets the opportunity to go to the birthplace of a devotional farm in Porbandar then there is a 200-year-old water storage in a house behind the house of the field.
Come, let us create a lot of lists related to water conservation and inspire people to store water.
You all should use this JanShakti4JalShakti and share your views.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you and the world for another thing.
The Presidents of many countries of the world, Prime Ministers, fame and citizens of the world have shown me through a tweet how Yoga is being done in every country.
On that day, the world showed up as a happy family.
We know that there is a need for healthy and understanding persons to establish a healthy society, Yoga ensures it.
Therefore, the spread of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Shouldn't we respect the recognition of such a service
In the year 2019, the announcement of the Prime Minister's Awards for the outstanding contribution to the progress and development of Yoga gave me an unprecedented opportunity.
The award is given to organisations which have contributed significantly to the spread of Yoga all over the world.
Japan Yoga Niketan conducts several institutions and training courses there
Similarly, Ms.
He is not an example of conception.
When it is a matter of Yoga, tell us whether India stands behind
The Yoga Day has been a special occasion to celebrate Yoga and to honour those who bring the message of Yoga to every household.
My heartfelt countrymen, this journey has started today, new feelings, new experiences, new determinations and new openings.
Yes, wait for your advice and advice as always.
We will meet us again and again, we will be happy to speak.
I hear your feelings, I gather, I understand.
Sometimes I try to live according to those feelings.
May your blessings continue.
You are my concepts, you are the ones who give me strength.
Come together, let us feel the voice of Mann Ki Baat, let us fulfil our duties in life on Tuesday.
Once again we meet again in the Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Today, when the voice of Mann Ki Baat begins, my heart feels vibrant.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave friends.
These brave soldiers have lost themselves to protect ourselves from 125 crore countrymen.
Our brave friends had dedicated themselves to the countrymen to sleep comfortably.
The hearts of the countrymen have been wounded and shouted in anger after the sacrifice of our brave soldiers in the Pulwama terror attack.
Condolences about the martyrs and their families are all over the world.
I salute the brave soldiers of the country who will save the Mother India, sacrifice their lives.
The task of facing this challenge before the nation should be forgotten all the differences of opinion such as casteism, religiousism and regionalism, and that is why our aspirations and decisions against terrorism will be determined and stern.
Our armed forces have ever shown the courage and valour of no one.
On the one hand, on the one hand, they showed their best talent, while they worked in the same language to understand the attackers.
You can see how action has been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
Military personnel have committed their commitment to the extremists and their suppliers to root Kelly.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the words and ideas that have been inspired by the media by their relatives have been widened and strengthened throughout the country.
Mina, wife of martyr Prasanna Sahu of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, celebrates the immense adventure of the country.
He has agreed that he will join his only son in the Central Border Security Force.
When the foundation stone of the martyr Vijay Shorena, who was fought with a three-flag flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, he said that his pinch son and I will work together in the army.
The glory of this pinch is that of today every child in India, within the body of every child, within the handicapped, the feeling of mixed life is increasing.
Whether it be the family of Deoria's martyr Vijay Maurya, the father of Tilakraj, the martyr of Gangtok, or the Balganag, full of Hemraj's six-year-old martyr of Koda, the stories of every family of the martyrs, the stories of the martyrs, the stimulation of the inspiration and the innerness.
I urge the youngsters to know, understand and understand what the families have shown and what the goals are being achieved.
There is no need to see the past layers of history to know what is patriotism, what is sacrifice and what is penance.
My creature and my countrymen...
For such a long time, we all waited for a war memorial, the wait period will end.
It is a natural thing to have the compassion and enthusiasm of the people in this regard.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Ongar Shetty of the state of Karnataka has expressed his happiness over the creation of the National War Memorial.
It gives memories of surprise and sadness that no national war memorial has been established so far in our country.
I wish that it should be a memorial decorated with the abominations of the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I am sure that such a memorial should be established in the country.
The second wheel reflects the courage and courage of the soldiers.
The valour of the soldiers will be carved on the walls of the museum.
Subsequently, the sacred chakra
This chakra reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this, the names of the soldiers who gave the nation the universal sacrifice will be inscribed in golden books.
Thereafter, the Raksha Chakra is a symbol of security.
There is a queue of dense trees on this chakra .
It is impossible to play the greatest contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces to the country's progress.
In October last year, I got the great opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
This memorial was also created by the spirit of gratitude to the men and women of our police who were engaged in security for all the time.
I am sure you will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go to those places, you must share your photographs on the social web site, so that others will be encouraged to see these things and will be interested in visiting these holy places.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and ideas of yours are coming to me in different ways for Mann Ki Baat.
This time when I was studying your ideas, one of the interesting ideas of Adish Mugobhadya ji attracted my attention.
His age is only 25 when the British arrested Birsa Munda on March 3, 1900.
Similarly, on 3rd March, Jamshedji Tata ji's birthday is also an accident.
Moreover, he and both of them belong to the entire family background, but both of them have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
Giving tributes to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat is in a way equivalent to respect the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great men have illuminated not only the name of Jharkhand but also the name of the whole country.
All over the country is grateful for their contribution.
If a person full of inspiration is required to guide our youth, then he is Lord Birsa Munda.
The British captured him when he was sleeping in a ruthless and ruthless manner.
Do you know why they accepted such a pride
Because the British had founded such a great empire because they saw him.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda suppressed the British regime using gun guns with the help of his traditional arrows.
In fact, if there is a leadership of imagination for the people, the mindset of the society becomes bigger than the power of arms.
The deprived and the oppressed took them to the sun that illuminated from dark life.
Bhagwan Birsa Munda sacrificed at the end of his 25 year life.
Like Birsa Munda, the sons of Bharat Mata have emerged in all parts of the country.
Such great men were filled all over the place that they couldn't be seen anywhere in India as a part of the freedom struggle that took place for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories about their sacrifices, swords and sacrifices are not going to the new generations.
If people like Bhagwan Birsa Munda have realized our presence then people like Jamshedji Tata have given great institutions to the country.
If you want to say well, Jamshedji Tata ji had a visionary advisor, he had not only seen the future of India but also laid a strong foundation for it.
He was very well aware that making India a pretext of science, technology and industry is the need for the future.
The Tata Institute of Science was established because of his vision, which is now known as the Indian Institute of Science.
Moreover, he established several reliable companies and industries like Tata Steel.
As a result of this interaction, Indian Institute of Sciences was born.
My dear countrymen, the birthday of former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Deshai on 29th February.
You all know that this day will come only once in four years.
Inside, Morarji Bhai, a peaceful person, is one of the most regulatory leaders of the country.
Morarji Bhai Deshai, who had presented the most budgetary report in the Parliament of Freedom India.
Morarjibai was the most difficult and efficient leadership of India, during that period, the country's democracy was in great danger.
Morarji Bhai Deshai dedicated himself against the emergencies to protect democracy.
For this, he had to pay a huge price in his volume.
The then government arrested him and imprisoned him.
But when the Janatha Party won in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
During his reign, the 44th Constitution was passed.
If this is important, the 42nd Constitution Amendment was brought at that time to reproduce the Emergency, in addition to decreasing the powers of the Supreme Court, some other slaughters in it have broken down our democratic values, so they were withdrawn.
That is, through the 44th Constitution Amendment, the empowerment of the proceedings of the Parliament and the Legislatures to print in the newspapers was empowered.
For the first time, a method of proclaiming the President's Emergency on the basis of the recommendations made by the Cabinet in writing and the period of emergency cannot be increased by more than 6 months in a way.
By declaring the emergency, Morarji Bhai ji had ensured that the democracies that were murdered and dug in 1975 could not go back to the stage.
His contribution to preserve the glory of Indian democracy is great and the future generations will remember it.
Once again I show my tributes to such a great leader.
They are creating a positive change in the lives of others in different ways with the help of their hard work.
They are the real karmayogis who do the service of the country self-reliantly than the service of the people and the service of the society.
When the Padma Awards are announced, you might have seen the people sell who is the awardee.
In a way, I consider it a great success because they will not be seen in the cards of television and newspapers, who are away from a day-long world.
However, those who do not have any concern that they should be named, who believe in working on the ground.
They live by following the lyrics of Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam.
I would like to share with you about some of these.
You must have been aware of the Daidari Nayak of Odisha, not because of the calling him the Canal Man of Odisha, but Daidari Nayak ji had built a canal road up to three kilometres by cutting the mountain with his hands in his village.
I paid homage to former US President Barack Obama on the Tree of Life painting built by Abdul Kafur.
Among the awardees, Shappir Said ji of Marathwada was known as the servant of Pasutha.
It is very strange and wonderful that how he dedicated his entire life to the service of Pashuta.
For the first time, for the victims of Madurai, he made efforts to contribute to the oppressed and oppressed, through the Mangalanjayam Mission of Tamil Nadu and started socially micro-financing.
Even though it has been a hundred years since, he has taught people Yoga all over the world and has so far made 1500 people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Dutu (Tudu), a famous woman named Lady Tarzan in Jharkhand, has done a daring job to oppose tree robbers and naxals, preventing the destruction of 50 hectares and inspired ten thousand women to combine and protect trees and wild animals.
This is because of the untiring efforts of the Jammu ji. Today, every village resident of the country is planting 18 trees during the birth of every child and 10 trees during the marriage of every woman.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer from Muzaffarpur in Bihar, is very imaginative.
Today, wherever I go to the country, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, Over the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have benefited from this scheme.
I can see how big changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
This scheme belongs to all such poor people.
My countrymen who are sitting in my heart, the examinations are going to start in schools.
Various academic boards across the country will start board examinations for 10 and 12th classes in the next few weeks.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the students who have written the examination, their parents and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a big event on the Pariksha Bay Church in Delhi was held in the Down Hall.
One of the special features of the interaction on the exams is that there are discussions on various subjects related to the exams without stopping.
Because thousands of years old culture and traditions are with us.
After a few days, the sacred day of Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri is coming on Monday, a special significance spreads the smell of smell in our hearts.
I had gone to Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend a short time with some of the disabled brothers and sisters.
Their self-confidence was really impressive and inspiring.
During the interaction, he said that a young person with disabilities is a platform artist and when he introduced himself as a mixer in the smile programmes, I asked you who would speak.
He said I will migrate like the Prime Minister.
And immediately, when I had done something right, I was waiting for a joyful surprise. He had spoken like that in the voice of Mann Ki Baat and made the voice of Mann Ki Baat through Michi.
I am happy to know that people not only listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat but also remember it in many occasions.
In fact, I was very desperate to see the power of this disabled youth and they had a great impact on me.
My dear countrymen, connecting with you all through the Mann Ki Baat programme has given me an unprecedented experience.
In a way, I have been associated with crores of families every month through the radio.
When you talk to you several times, while reading your letters and listening to your telephone calls, the idea that you consider me as a member of your family improves in my mind.
This feeling reflects a pleasant experience in my mind.
Friends, Elections are the greatest celebrations of democracy.
For the next two months, we have been drowned in the electoral process.
I am also a candidate for this election.
In order to respect the healthy democratic tradition, the next Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday in May.
That is, in March-April, all my feelings of these three months, after the elections, with the strength of your blessings, once again I will start the series of our conversation with the voice of Mann Ki Baat and I will travel together for several years with the voice of your mind.
Once again I express my gratitude.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Shivkumar Swami is following this philosophy.
He served for the social, education and economic development of thousands of people in his 111 years of life.
Whatever his Pandism was widespread, he had an excellent illusion in English, Sanskrit and Kannada.
He's a social reformer.
He spent his entire life in food, accommodation, education and spiritual wisdom.
The main objective of the life of Swamiji was to provide all kinds of benefits to the farmers.
The Chittaganga Monastery is organising cattle and agricultural festivals in a smooth manner.
I have been blessed with the blessings of the blessed Swamiji.
In 2007, during the centenary celebrations of Shri Sri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji, our former President Dr. A.
On this occasion, Kalam Iya had read a poem written for a commemorative Swamiji.
This poem of Dr. Kalam Aya explains in a beautiful way the life of Sri Sri Shivkumar Swamiji and the goal of Chittaganga Monastery.
There is a very important organization in our country
This is a part of our democracy and a part of our democracy. I talk about the Election Commission of India.
On January 25, the founding day of the Election Commission is celebrated as National Voters Day.
Looking at the scale of elections in India, the world is surprised by the nose
Polling centres are being set up in Himachal Pradesh at a height of 15,000 feet and in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
You must have heard about Gujarat
In the Gir forest area, only one voter has been set up in a far-flung area.
Just imagine, guys...
It is the beauty of our democracy that the entire group of EC personnel goes to far-flung areas to keep the voter in mind and get the opportunity to use the voter's vote.
I convey my heartfelt appreciation to the Election Commission, which has been making constant efforts to strengthen the democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commissions of all the States, all the security forces and other workers who are not independent and unparalleled in the election work.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country
The youth born in the 21st century are going to vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections this time.
They have the opportunity to bear the responsibility of the country on their shoulders.
Now they are going to become participants in the process of making decisions for the country.
When their dreams were linked to the dreams of the country, they were obliged.
If you are eligible to vote, I urge young social friends to register your name in the list of voters.
If you are unable to vote for some reason in life, then we must feel that it is sad to us.
If we say that there was a mistake in the country then we should be sorry.
This activity has to be transformed into our natural nature.
I urge the people of the country to take up a campaign and create awareness this time, whether we all join us to vote together and vote on the day of polling.
I am sure that younger generation voters will register their names in large numbers, their contribution to our democracy and will further strengthen it.
My dear countrymen, in this great land of India many times great personalities have emerged, such great personalities have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
On January 23, he celebrated his birth anniversary in a new way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I had the great privilege of inaugurating a museum dedicated to those who had contributed in the freedom struggle.
Inside the Red Fort, many such rooms and memorials have been closed since independence.
Such closed Red Fort rooms have been transformed into a magnificent museum, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Yaad-e-Jalian museum dedicated to the Indian National Army
The museum built in the memory of India's First Freedom War of 1857 is dedicated to the entire campus as the Kranti Mandir, a revolutionary temple.
Every brick in these museums smells the aroma of our glorious history.
At this place, the British government had filed a lawsuit against Bharat Mata's brave friends - Colonel Prem Cycle, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Tillon and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
When I was watching the memories associated with Netaji at the revolutionary temple of the Red Fort, one of the families of Netaji gave me a very special hat.
Indeed, the valour and patriotism of our heroes needs to be repeated to our new generations in different corners.
About a month ago, on 30th December, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
At the place where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose flagged off 75 years ago, I got the opportunity to flag the tricolour at the same place.
On this occasion, the announcement regarding the Government of Azad Hind was held 75 years ago.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a talented administrator.
Such brave soldiers have contributed significantly in the freedom struggle.
Dilli Chalo, give me an answer, I will give you freedom. With the sensitivity and motivation that will give you freedom, Netaji will be removed in the minds of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for secret claims about him to be brought to the public
I am very happy that we have done this work.
I don't think that all the family members of Netaji had come to my house for a day.
Together, we had talked about many things related to Netaji and presented our sympathies to Netaji Pose.
Efforts have been made to develop several places related to the great heroes of India in Delhi.
May it be 26 associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Alipur Road, Sardar Patel Museum and Kranti Mantra.
If you come to Delhi, you must visit these places.
My countrymen, today when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, I would like to share a thing related to Netaji's life in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I have always thought of radio as an important media that connects people.
I have been told that this radio station has been broadcast once a week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bangla, Marathi, Punjab, Pashto and Urudu.
In this radio station, M.
R.
Vyas ji's contribution is very significant.
The programmes of broadcasting in Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the ordinary people, which gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A museum has been built in this revolutionary temple.
Efforts are being made to explain Indian art and culture in a more attractive way.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum, where there are more than 450 centuries old paintings and artefacts.
The museum showcases the most excellent works of great artists like Amruda Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
You all visit there and see the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, especially to all of you.
You can imagine what this is about art, but you can go here and talk about the great works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You all know Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a musician.
But I want to tell you that Gurudev is also a painting.
The special thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not given any name to his majority works.
He thought that the person who sees the painting himself should understand it and see the message given by the painting in his own eyes.
His paintings have been depicted in European countries, Russia and in the United States.
I am sure you will go to the Grand Mantra and see his paintings.
My dear countrymen, India is full of pilgrimages.
Our saints have conveyed messages of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
Chand Ravidas is such a pilgrimage.
On February 19, Ravidas ji was born.
Indeed, if God dwells in all human beings, it will not be worth seeing to divide him into the forms of caste, religion and section.
Guru Ravidas was born on the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his messages, Pilgrim Ravidas was trying to understand the importance of labour and labour in his entire life.
It would not be exaggerated if he said that he had explained the truth of the importance of labour to the world.
Once again I remember the sacred Ravidas ji.
My dear countrymen, in MyGov Kiren Siddar ji has been asking him to speak in Mann Ki Baat about the Indian Space Department and the dimensions related to the future.
Vikram Sarabhai has contributed significantly to Indias space programme.
Our space programme contributes to the contribution of innumerable young scientists of the country.
It is a matter of surprising that the advanced satellites and soundingrockets through our students are carrying out space.
On 24th January, only the Kalamsat Application was designed by our students.
The sounding rockets created by university students in Odisha have also been praised.
All such space missions have been carried out in the last four and a half years since independence.
We have achieved 104 satellites in the same space space.
We will soon register Indias position in the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technology in a very special way for the protection of lives.
Space technology is helping in all these areas, be it cyclone, rail and road safety.
NAVIC equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which helps them safeguard and economic development.
We are implementing the services and responsibility of the government using space technology in a special way.
Under the Housing for All, about 40 lakh houses have been provided in 23 states.
Moreover, about three and a half crore assets have also been geo-tacked under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Scheme.
Our satellites today are the symbols of the growing power of the country.
It is because of its contribution that we have established special linkages with many countries of the world.
There is a unique effort to be South Asia Satellites, which has given the pride of development to our neighbouring friendly countries.
Through its special competitive transport services, India is not only of the developing countries but also of the developing countries.
The heavens and heavens have always been attractive to children.
Our space programme provides opportunities and opportunities to move beyond the borders and see however impossible it is to think bigger.
Our children are attracted by folk songs, inspires new stars and gives a vision.
My dear countrymen, I always say that whoever plays, they are developing and blossoming, this time Kellow India has illuminated the sportspersons.
In January, about 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports games in Khelo India Youth Games in Pune.
If the sportsperson works well at the local level, he can understand the best in the world.
This time in Khelo India, sportspersons from all the states have shown their talent.
He lives in a car with his family.
Likewise, Captain Sonali Helvey of the Kabadik group of Maharashtra for women under the age of 21 lives in Sathara.
He lost his father at the younger age, and his brother and his mother have inspired and encouraged Sonali.
Sometimes we have seen that women are not more inspired in sports like Kabdi.
But all these were chosen by Sonali, who worked well.
Abhinav Shah, a 10-year-old Asansol, has been proud to win a gold medal at the youngest age in the Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter Akshta Vaswani Kamthi has won a gold medal in the swimming category.
His father is a farmer from Belgaum.
But didn't you ask about the competition to shine the toilet
More than 50 lakh toilets participated in this unique competition that has been taking place for nearly a month.
The name of this unique competition is a clean beautiful toilet.
In addition to keeping their toilets clean, they used to beautify them and used some paintings, many photographs related to clean toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup can be seen on social networks.
I urge all Panchayat leaders and villagers to take the lead in such a movement in your Panchayat.
Definitely share the pictures of your clean beautiful toilets with MyIzatGhar on the social platform.
Friends, Together with the aim of cleaning the country and liberating the habit of open defecation, we had made a memorable journey on October 2, 2014.
Due to the collaboration of the people of India, today, before 2nd October, 2019, we are moving forward towards getting rid of the habit of open defecation and that is why we can dedicate our tributes to him on the 150th Birth Anniversary.
In this memorable journey of Swachh Bharat, the contribution of Mann Ki Baat lovers is also great, while I am happy to share this thing with you, they have announced that more than 5. 5 lakh villages and 600 districts have been freed from the habit of open defecation. The rate of cleanliness in rural India has reached 98 percent of the people and about 9 crore families.
My little friends, the days of examination are coming closer.
I have been asking Ansul Sharma MyGov, who lives in Himachal Pradesh, to talk about examinations and exam warriors.
Ansul ji, thank you for this thing.
Yes, the first part of the year is the election period for many families.
All the students, their parents and teachers are embodied in the work related to the examination.
Moreover, students from across the country will also be participating in this event.
In this Pariksha Pe Church, I have spoken about all aspects related to the examinations, particularly with our young friends about the unconscious examination.
For this, I have been urging many people to send inputs and comments.
I am happy that a large number of people have shared their views in MyGov.
Some of these ideas and suggestions will definitely be presented during the Down Hall event.
You must participate in this program...
You will also be able to see its direct broadcast through social media and Namo App.
May this journey of 2019 be successful.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
At that time, the benefits of experiences will be an opportunity for us and the self-confidence of doing a new thing will also emerge.
If we do, we should think that not only changes in our lives, but also contribute to the country and society.

All these have been accompanied by the uninterrupted efforts of 130 crore people.
Jayachandran belongs to God.
People say that he was eager to treat patients at any time.
Similarly, Sulagiti Narasamma from Karnataka also joined God on 25th December.
Sulagiti Narasamma was helpful in delivery to pregnant mothers.
He has served thousands of mothers in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored with the Padma Shri award.
While talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of our party had told me that some young doctors had camped in the city and provided free treatment to the poor.
Every month, many poor patients are benefiting from this camp.
The motivation of these medical friends who are engaged in selflessness is really commendable.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful movement because of social efforts.
A few days ago, some people have told me that at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, more than 3 lakh people have joined the Swachhta movement at the same time.
People from all walks of life, including municipalities, NGOs, schools and colleges, and the people of Jabalpur were present in this mahaya of Swachhta.
Incom, success stories of innovative youth and entrepreneurs have been defined very well.
Well, will we do a job

Let us all spread a positive feeling.
Through this, a large number of people will be aware of our heroes who have transformed society.
There is a special significance for sports in every society.
While playing, there is a lot of energy in the minds of those who see it.
We feel many things like the name, identity and respect of the sportspersons.
However, sometimes there are many things behind them and bigger things than the sports world.
I want to tell you about Hanaya Nizar, a girl from Kashmir, who has won a gold medal in Koria's Karate competition.

As soon as Rajani won the medal, he immediately went to a nearby milk shop and drank a cup of milk.
After that, Rajani roamed his medal in a cloth and put it in his bag.
Yeah, why did Rajani drink a cup of milk, all of you think, yeah
He did this to pay homage to his father Jasmer Singh, who is selling luxury at a shop in Panipath.
Rajani later said that his father had made a great sacrifice to achieve this situation and had tolerated many difficulties.
He also won a medal in Serbia.
This year, a 20-year-old boy from Pune, Vedanki Kulkarni, became the first Asian woman who has been the fastest growing world in the cycle.

Isn't we imagined when these achievements are heard about such successes
The names of all these festivals may be different, but it is a feeling that celebrates everything. These festivals are somehow connected with harvesting and harvesting, these festivals are connected with the farmers, the villages and the crops.
During this time, the time of sun-urayana is to enter the sun-magar rasi.
After this gradually starts increasing day by day, the crops of cold harvesting starts harvesting.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The joy of unity in diversity - the feeling of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat spreads the fragrance through our festivals.
We can see how closely our festivals and monasteries are with nature.
Many of our festivals have been enhanced in the spirit of rivers and water conservation.
On the sacred day, the sun is worshipped in rivers and waterfalls.
During the Makar Sankranti, millions of people take holy bath in the sacred rivers.
Sharing your photographs during these festivals with everyone so that everyone can enjoy the beauty of the diversity and culture of India.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela is a magnificent diversity, and so much forgiveness.
People from all over the country and the world come and join the Kumbh Mela.
People mix the ocean with faith and faith in the Kumbh Mela.
At the same time, millions of people from abroad join the country.
The tradition of Kumbh is enjoying our great cultural timber.
This time, starting on January 15, the world famous Kumbh Mela to be held in Prayagraj is looking forward to all of you.
On the occasion of Kumbh, saints and pilgrimages started coming.

There is a possibility of people coming from over 150 countries to participate in the Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj.
With the divineity of the Kumbh Mela, the glory of India will showcase its glory in the world stage.
The Kumbh Mela is a big instrument to realize itself and every person coming here has different experiences and they see spiritual things and understand them.
This gives the youngsters the opportunity to be a great learning experience in particular.
I had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I was able to see that arrangements for Kumbh Mela are being made very critically.
The people of Prayagraj are very excited about the Kumbh Mela.

Cleanliness along with difficulty in arrangements will also reach the remote areas.
This time devotees can perform the sacred darshan of Akshayvada after a holy bath at the confluence.

May this spiritual Kumbh be the fame of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the fame of the nation.
May this Kumbh of devotees be the glory of the world's tourists.
There was a connection with the gratitude of Bapu to South Africa.

We can pay homage to Sardar Patel by this award.
My dear countrymen, the holy birthday of Guru Gobind Singh Ji on 13th January.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
His work was North India till a large part of his life, and he joined the Nanded in Maharashtra.
The birthplace Patna and the works are in North India and the last moments of life in Nandede.
In a way, we can say that the whole of India has received his blessings.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice from the Sikh Gurus.
But whenever efforts were made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, injustice against them, Guru Gobind Singh ji gave a loud voice to the poor and the weak, hence he used to fight shoulder to shoulder and shoulder, hence he said that Sawa Lakshe Ak Ladaum, Siddian Son Main Baj Dudahum, Dabe Gobind Singh Nama Kahaum.
He said, "Modi will not express his strength to the weak.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji thought that it is a great service to wipe away the sorrows of humanity.
He was an honoured man with the characteristics of valour, supreme sacrifice and devotion.
Apart from this, Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Samskritam, Persian, Hindi and Udu were experts in many languages.
Once again I bow to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My hearts and my countrymen, there are many events in the country which are not much debated.
This is a different attempt by FSSAI.
Festivals are being organized across the country on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Healthy India Travels are being undertaken by the mission of Eat Right India to take regular food to India.
When India becomes clean and healthy, it is itself self-reliant.

Knowledge about the importance of food is essential since childhood.
My dear countrymen, this is the concluding event of 2018 that we will join again in the year 2019, we will talk with heart again.
Whether it is a personal life or the life of the country or the life of the society, the inspiration is the source of development.

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
In October 3, 2014, on the day of Vijaya Dasamit, we all took a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
This time, most of the letters and telephone calls from you are in touch with this 50th part.
In MyGov, Ansu Kumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Patna, Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jain from Delhi, Prasenjit Sarkar from Barthwan in West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur have raised all the same questions.
Your interest is natural.
In today's times, why is Modi being connected to the radio in almost forgotten
I want to tell you about an incident.
This happened in 1998.
I was working as the Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
In the month of May, I was going to a place.
Take a lotu kept in a blanket utensil with him and eat a lotu before tea is ready.
I was astonished, why did it happen to anyone in the house like marriage
No, man, do you know
I'm the only idea.
Behold, he said he would first listen to the radio.
He was talking about it in the radio.
In this jungle area, in such a desert area, a common man has been selling tea as his own in the snowy mountains and asking for radio throughout the day.
Therefore, when I am the Prime Minister, the most powerful media, Radio's milk, is not surprising to turn my attention.
From the remote villages of the country to the cities, from the farmers to the young entrepreneurs, it has inspired Mann Ki Baat.
Millions of letters were read every month, telephone calls were heard, apps and MyGov criticisms were made
The journey of these 50 areas, which have been linked to the same labour and enjoyed in this interesting way, has also been done by us for this journey.
Now the All India Radio has also conducted a study on Mann Ki Baat.
Some of the backgrounds found in it are very interesting.
As many as 70 of those who have been studying, 70 of them have been constantly asking for Mann Ki Baat.
The elderly consider the creative spirit of society as a great contribution to Mann Ki Baat.
The voice of Mann Ki Baat has inspired mass movements in large numbers.
Indipositive is also being widely discussed.
All these underscore the positive and positive feelings of the minds of our people.
People are sharing their people that the spirit of self-reliance has increased because of the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
The idea of social service is a big change in the minds of the people.
But people did not join this program only through Holi.
The people of Mann Ki Baat are making their contributions through the television, F. Emwanoli, Mobile, Internet, Facebook Direct Broadcasting, Pariscope and Narendra Modi App.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all sections of the Mann Ki Baat family for their faith in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Your doubt is right.
At the end of their survey, this event was an unpolitical decision.
When Mann Ki Baat began, I had convinced that it should not be political or betray the government, and Modi should not be seen anywhere in it.
The aspirations of the beloved in the letters, Internet comments and telephone calls before every Mann Ki Baat were clearly known.
Modi will come and go but this country will continue to persist and will not be destroyed by our culture.
Small stories of 130 crore people will not be hidden.
I read the letter, if the same sense was published in another letter, I would also suggest it.
With this, I also share my experience and share with you.
The movement of Mantiselfi, which started from a small village in Haryana, spread all over the country and abroad, cannot be so wide and aware.
When every section and fame of the society joins, a new dialect of consciousness changes in society, today's generation understands it and the unknowing consciousness emerges.
India's Antaramma is about social justice and social power.
There are thousands of aspects of social life, one of them is political.
If it becomes all in politics, it is not a good system for a healthy society.
Sometimes, however political events and politicians dominate, many other skills and other efforts of the society are suppressed.
Thank you for your phone call.
In a way, you have been heard because of your confusion.
If I want to respond directly to the question you asked, then it is only that I don't have any preparations in the islands.
In fact, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is a simple thing for me.
People's letters come in front of every Mann Ki Baat.
That letter is not just a paper for me.
In fact, for nearly 40-45 years, I have lived the life of a saint, I have gone to most parts of the country and have spent a lot of time in the remote districts of the country.
If you want to tell the truth, the voice of Mann Ki Baat is mine, but examples, emotions and feelings are all of my countrymen.
I have not been able to tell millions of such people in the voice of Mann Ki Baat till date, but all of this is not disappointing, they are giving their letters and their views.
I am confident that all of you will come to me more than ever before, your ideas will contribute to making the mindset more interesting, more effective and more terrible.
Efforts are being made to the concerned department regarding the letters and comments that have not been in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to express my gratitude to All India Radio, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other televisions and my friends from social workshops.
In this way, they become Narendra Modi for 30 minutes.
I express my gratitude to all of them for their talents and skills.
I would like to appeal to you all that you must listen to this event in your state languages.
Any politicalist will never be happy with the media, the very little coverage is available and it is also negative.
But the media made their own a lot of things raised in the voice of Mann Ki Baat.
Cleanliness, road safety, non-drunken India and a mobile phone with daughters have been done by the media innovative ways to transform it into a movement.
If you had no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Finance Minister, thank you for your telephone call.
If you want to tell the truth, I have no secret.
It becomes easier to understand anyone until the consequences in our lives do not interfere.
Sometimes, we talk about the difference between the elderly and the aged.
In fact, most of the prosperous talk to the adolescents is less.
I have always been trying to continuously interact with the youth through various programmes and social networks.
I have always been trying to get rid of what they do or what they think.
Through the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I have been trying to give greater importance to the efforts of the youth.
But I believe that there is no time to waste among the youngsters, this thing helps the younger generation to create more innovations because they want to finish the tasks quickly.
We find that today's youngsters are more talented and big things.
Well, let them dream of great dreams and achieve great successes.
Some say that younger generations are going to do many things at the same time.
I'm sorry, can you miss this thing
At the same time, the scholars are doing many things.
If we look around us, be it social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports and other sectors, the youth who make a big change in society.
These youngsters are asking questions and they have the power to dream.
If we establish the ideas of the youth in the earth, if we make the environment free to shape them then we can create a positive change in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vinita Ji in MyGov, in the voice of Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk about the Constitution Day that will be held on November 26.
Why is it special for this day, he added that in the 70th year we have accepted our Constitution, we have got a footprint.
Vineetha ji, I thank you for your advice.
Yes, Tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
This is a day when we think of human beings who have given us the Constitution.
Our Constitution was accepted on 26th November, 1949.
It took two years, 11 months and 17 days to fulfil the historic work of the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great men have made us such a comprehensive and profound legislation.
The rapid pace that they have created the Arbitration Act is still an example of time governance and productivity.
We also give the concept of fulfilling our responsibilities in a time bound manner.
The significance of our Constitution is that it is detailed in detail about duties without rights.
It is a memorable event to embrace the awareness of the Constitution between the youth and connect them with various aspects of the Constitution.
As a Republic of 2020, we will complete 70 years of our journey and we will complete 75 years of independence in 2022.
Let us all take the values of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity and peace, development and prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, you should never forget the contribution of that great man at the centre of the Constituent Assembly.
He is the Honourable Doctor.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
On the 6th of December, he was the day of his Mahabhari.
I convey my tributes to Baba Saheb for all the people of the country and he gained the right to live with dignity and dignity of crores of Indians.
Democracy is mixed with Baba Saheb's nature and the democratic value of India is not imported from outside.
What is democracy and what is the Parliamentarian system is, it is not new to India.
My servants pay homage to Baba Saheb, another time.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, Guru Nanak Dev Jis birth anniversary was celebrated on 23rd November and next year in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th birth anniversary.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought about the welfare of humanity.
He always pushed the path of opportunity, work, service, compassion and brotherhood in society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been asked to make this month the most excellent.
Similarly, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
Moreover, a train will be made on the path of Guru Nanak Dev Ji with the holy places.
Now, when I was participating in a meeting related to this, I got the idea of Lakhbat Saheb Gurudwara.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had a great impact.
But in collaboration with those circles, the state government has reconstructed it even today is an example.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th part of Mann Ki Baat, we meet again in the next Mann Ki Baat and today I have got the opportunity to bring forward the feelings of Mann Ki Baat before you for the first time.
As much as I join you, our journey will be deeper and happy to all.
The question of what I got from Mann Ki Baat can be raised in some people's minds.
Today, I would like to tell you that the backgrounds of Mann Ki Baat and one of these things are touching my heart. When all of the family members sit together and listen to the voice of Mann Ki Baat, the head of our family sits among us and shares with us about our things.
Your sweets, my sweets.
Your expectations, my expectations.
Your desires, and my desires.
Come on, we will take this journey forward.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31, the birth anniversary of our beloved Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is.
This year, the youth of the country are ready to participate in the 'Unity Run' programme.
Climate is comfortable now.
Therefore, I urge a large number of people to participate in unity drive.
Just six months before the independence of the country, on January 27, 1947, the world famous international newspaper 'Tym' was shot by Sardar Patel on its first side.
In the editorial of the newspaper, they also published Indias map
But that map doesn't look like now.
India showcased a piece of maps in that map.
It had more than 550 regimes.
When they left the country, they thought that India should have been a piece of pieces.
The Time commented that India is facing various threats such as separation, violence, food deficit, price rise and power politics.
He added that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel would be able to integrate the country and heal the wounds in the minds of the people.
The article describes the rest of the life history of India's iron man.
During the floods in Ahmedabad by 1920, he took up relief measures and carried out the Partoli Satyagraha.
His sincerity and commitment was as much as the farmers, the workers and the industrialists had full faith in him.
Sardar Patel took a hand in every problem to integrate the country as he destabilised the war with the fear of a single book.
He ensured that all the kingdoms of the country are connected to united India.
Whether it is Junagadh, Hyderabad, Tagore States or the States of Rajasthan, the integrated India we now see is the main reason for Sardar Patel's sensitivity and vision.
This statue, built on the banks of the Narmada river of Gujarat, is twice as high as the freedom goddess of the United States.
This will be the highest statue of the world.
Every Indian will be proud to see the highest statue of the world being built in India.
Sardar Patel, the real friend of our soil, will decorate our air space.
I am confident that this statue that has dedicated the mother of India will make every Indian proud.
Because the desire to see the statue of unity is natural in every Indian's mind.
I am confident that this statue will be a place where people from all over the country want to see.
My dear brothers and sisters, we all celebrated Kalatpada Diwas yesterday.
I salute everyone who is part of India's security forces.
I also salute the families of our soldiers.
You must know why we are celebrating the Kalad Phase for this day.
In this day, Indian troops took a foot in Kashmir and saved the valley from being caught in the occupation.
This incident is also directly related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I read an old interview of our respected army officer Sham Maneksha.
Fild Marshal Sham Maneksha reminded him of his tenure as Colonel.
At that time military operations started in Kashmir.
In a meeting held at that time, Field Marshal Maneksha pointed out how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was slaughtered for the delay in sending troops to Kashmir and noted that there should be no delay in sending troops, and the problem should be resolved quickly and Sardar Patel gave him a clear instruction.
With this, if our forces flew to Kashmir, we can know how our army successfully worked.
The commemoration day of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is on 31st October.
We pay homage to Indira Gandhi.
My dear countrymen, who would not like sports.
If our youngsters have these capabilities then our country will not only develop in the field of economic and scientific technology but also in the field of sports.
I am very happy to have two recent meetings.
I congratulated them and their commitment to achieving barriers and achieving success will inspire all the people of our country.
Similarly, I got the opportunity to meet the winners of the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina.
You will be aware that in the summer Olympics of 2018 youngsters, the performance of our youth has not yet been excellent.
We got 13 medals in this competition and three medals in the Collection Double category.
You must imagine that the activity of Indian soldiers in the recent Asian Games has been excellent.
You must have noticed that I have repeated the word "excellent or unprecedented achievement".
This is a reality that reflects the progress made in the sports sector of India every day.
Not only in the field of sports but also innumerable sectors, India is making new achievements.
For instance, I would like to indicate you to the disabled sportspersons who have won the gold medal in the Asian Games 2018.
He is a disabled person in his birth.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He then lived at home for eight years.
After that, he left the house and worked on the Delhi Transport Corporation buses and on the roadside restaurants.
The same Narayan has won India's medal in international competitions.
Not only this, it should also be taken care of how the sports sector of India is at a rapid pace.
Moreover, India has not won a medal in the Junior or Chinese category so far.
However, in the Youth Olympics, India's Tapapi Devi has won a silver medal and has achieved a historic achievement.
Tapabi Devi, a 16-year-old, belongs to a Kuggram in Manipur.
His father is an ordinary worker, mother fishing.
It's a period of no money even to buy food items.
In such a situation, his interest, dedication and dedication have not been reduced.
He has won a medal for the nation and has made history.
The entire world appreciated that this competition was very successful.
The World Cup competition for FIFA 17 years old has achieved a record number of innovators in the field.
More than 12 lakh sports enthusiasts have discovered football competitions in various sports stakeholders of the country and encouraged the youth.
This year, we have got the opportunity to hold Men Hockey Competitions 2018 at Bhubaneswar.
The World Cup hockey competition will conclude from 28th November to 16th December.
Every Indian, whether he plays any game or is interested in any sports, will definitely be interested in the hockeype.
In the Hockey Games, India has achieved the achievements of golden brasses.
India has won Gold in various events and has won the World Championships once.
India has also created a lot of best hockey soldiers.
Whenever citing the hockey sports, it cannot be completed without mentioning our achievements.
Major Dayanchand, who is considered the father of Hockey, is famous all over the world.
Besides, the Indian Hockey has a long tradition from Bulbir Singh Chinese, Lesli Clarius Mohammad Shahid, Utham Singh and Dhanrajya.
Even now, the soldiers of the Indian Army are inspired by their hard work and goals.
This is a good opportunity for sports enthusiasts who want to see the most excellent competition.
Go to Bhubaneswar and motivate the Indian team and every hero who is playing there.
The state of Odisha is not only an excellent historical background but also a rich cultural heritage.
The people of that state are very bad.
This is a unique opportunity for sportspersons to see Odisha.
The world famous pilgrimage places like Konark Sun Temple, Puri Jagannath Temple and Silka Lake can also be enjoyed.
I convey my best wishes to the Indian mankind who participated in this competition and assure them that they have the support of 125 crore Indians.
I convey my best wishes to all the teams from different countries of the world to participate in this competition.
My dear countrymen, the mindset of those who work for social work is indeed an inspiration and motivation for all the people of the country.
However, in the present new era, new generations are innovative and enthusiastic with innovative methods.
I had participated in the inaugural function of a new portal called 'In the Community,' which has begun to provide opportunities for my government and to encourage the IT and electronic industry of the country to work in the social activities of the workers.
Their dedication and valour will make every Indian proud.
The transformation that I am not - we have created a new environment for the society from individuals to society and to work in the field of Information Technology.
Some sing to the adults
Some have dedicated themselves to cleanliness and some are helping the farmers.
However, there is no point of view behind anyone's action and their commitment is inspired by their commitment.
However, a person who is sitting in the Chakra chair and learns to play the sportspersons with disabilities will be able to wear wheels and sportspersons with disabilities.
This feeling and dedication is an activity.
This will make every Indian proud.
I am not - we will definitely attract all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, When you see your suggestions on the Mann Ki Baat programme today, the idea of Shri Manish Mahbhadra from Puducherry was very inspiring.
Through My Government App, the tribals and their traditions and traditions have taken a part in the Mann Ki Baat programme as an example of natural environment.
He said how tribal traditions can be followed by sustainable development in our lives and learn from such traditions.
I congratulate you for presenting this issue among the lovers of Manish and Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will encourage us to know our dignified past and ancient traditions when the entire world, particularly the Western countries, discuss environmental protection and explore new ways to pursue a balanced lifestyle.
Our country is also facing this problem.
But in order to solve it, we must remember the golden age of our past and know our traditional prosperity, particularly the lifestyle of our tribal people.
It is an integral part of the lives of our tribal people to collaborate with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship the trees, plants and flowers as God.
Bil residents of Central India, particularly Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are planting trees of tribals, Beepal and Arjun.
The Pishnoys living in the desert region of Rajasthan are guiding us how to protect the environment.
In particular, they are ready to give their lives, rather than affect a tree in the matter of protecting trees.
The Mishmi tribes of Arunachal Pradesh are friendly with the LTTE.
They consider the LTTE as their brothers and sisters.
Even in Nagaland, the LTTE remains a forest guard.
The Varli people of Maharashtra consider the LTTE as their guests, the LTTE with them and reflects their prosperity.
Central India's Gol race considers the LTTE to be directly related to their lives and feels that if the LTTE does not get food, the entire village will be in the grip.
During the period of fishing, the Gond people of Central India stop fishing in the Kaithan river.
Those who consider this region as a fish sanctuary think that these sweet fishes will be largely available due to their confidence.
At the same time, the tribals are also setting up their homes with strong and environment friendly natural products.
The Thodar race residents in some individual areas of the Nilgiri mountain range of South India only build their dwellings with the items available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, this is a testimony that tribals believe in living very peacefully and compassionately, and it also feels that if someone tries to damage or damage their natural resources, they will not be able to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that many of our freedom fighters were leading soldiers and belonging to tribal communities.
No one can forget Bhagwan Birzamunda, who fought sternly against British imperialism to protect his forests.
Besides, I have mentioned so far, we can list a lot of tribal communities who have taught us about how to co-exist with nature and we are very obliged to continue living in the forest areas of the country.
Everyone should come forward to express his gratitude to them.
My dear countrymen, we have spoken of individuals and organisations who have played a valuable role in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
However, these works are not enough, but they have inspired the deepest feelings of our thinking to show a new way to work for the society.
A few days ago, I read about the farmer brother Kurbachan Singh of Panchayat.
The son of Kurbachan Singh, a farmer brother who has worked hard, will be married.
Kurbachan Singh has specifically told the bride's parents to take this marriage in a very simple manner.
He said there is no need to spend much for marriage welcome or any other thing.
He said that it should be considered as a very ordinary phenomenon and suddenly imposed a condition.
The condition of the woman is that she should ensure that her household, her crops will be placed in the fields and we will not burn agricultural wastes.
You should consider the social strength of this idea well.
However, it demonstrates how high his well-being is, and how many families in our society find solutions to their personal problems to the entire society.
Thiruvananthapuram Kurbachan Singh's family has shown us such an example.
I also read about Kalarmajra village near Naba in Punjab.
Instead of burning the potter, Kalarmajra village has come to light by the farmers who followed the new technologies of swimming them with soil.
Congratulations to Kurbachan Singh
Congratulations to the people of Kalarmajra village and all those who have not been polluted in their surroundings.
You all have been the real way forward to the Indian tradition with a healthy lifestyle.
Just as the sea is formed because of the consolidation of small drops of water, every positive activity is necessary to create a good environment.
My dear countrymen, our archaeologicals also describe this: 'Cowlay, in all the works like water, air, land, fire, breathing, medicine, plantations, gardens and deepness in all the three worlds.
Every soul within me and within you, every heart and this battle should be peaceful anywhere.
Om Shanti: Shanti...
Wherever there is talk of world peace, India's name and contribution will be engraved by golden texts.
For India, this year is special on November 11, as the first world war ended hundred years ago on November 11.
We feel that in the end of the hundred years, the catastrophe and humanitarian deaths have taken place for a hundred years.
For India, the first world war is very important.
In fact, we don't have any direct contact with that war.
However, our soldiers have fought with courage and sacrifices in the war.
Indian soldiers have also explained that if there is a war, Indians are not slaves.
Our soldiers have shown their courage and valour in difficult areas and bad weather.
The only purpose was to create peace.
The world knows that there was a huge loss of lives and content during the First World War.
About one crore soldiers and innocent people are reported to have died in the same way.
This is what the whole world realised the importance of peace.
The meaning of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today peace is not just a war but also a need for global cooperation and integration to address terrorism, climate change, social change and economic development.
The development of the poor is the real example of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern states have a specialty.
There is no link to the natural beauty of the North-Eastern states - the people of the region are very talented.
Now the North-Eastern states are well-known by their excellent activities.
The North-Eastern region has witnessed great progress in organic farming.
To encourage sustainable food processing, Sikkim has received the Gold Award for the valuable future policy 2018 a few days ago.
Not only this, Sikkim has won the award, which has withdrawn the recommendations received from 25 countries.
I congratulate the people of Sikkim for this.
I am confident that such festivals will be an opportunity to accept new pledges.
Your progress is very important for the progress of the country.
If you develop then this country will also develop.
My best wishes to all of you.
